The Beginning
The clouds over the sky, the dark ground all around is a wolf.
Their stairs, Their bloody corpses, their armor, their weapons, all were so confused, desolate, with the smell of death and danger.
Rod breathed, but he could not feel the cold and blood in the air, it was after all a game.
Thinking of this, Rod shook his head with a bitter laugh, then he turned and looked down at the warriors who were sitting on the ground not far from him, who were now quietly resting, restoring their strength, repairing their weapons.
On the surface looks nothing different from the week, but Rod is clear, this war, not as easy as before.
How many people are left?
He asked in silence.
When they heard the question, they looked at each other, and then a thin witch stood up.
Ninety- six, Commander, The Phantom is more dangerous than we imagined,and many of our brothers have been trapped in the past,but fortunately, our careers are in order now.
It'll be fine.
Hearing this,Rod nodded, and said nothing more, while the others remained silent.
I'm afraid they've lost the courage to start the mess, at last they're going to face, the most powerful, the most terrible, never conquered by anybody, the fictional dragon, the final wave of the third chapter of the online game Dragon Quest,
It's also the most frightening existence to date.
Faced with such battles, ordinary councils had to organize at least ten groups to dare to challenge, and now, Rod's men had only 96, so that a whole group could not fit together, but even so, in the eyes of these men, there was no panic or confusion at all, some only calmness, confidence and trust.
And those whom they trusted were standing in front of them on the steps not far from them, looking up at the sky, firm as a stone on their faces, and a cold scar from their foreheads, giving them a sense of deterrence.
The glittering helmet covered that mighty body, as if a wall never fell.
Of course, they are not because of the appearance of the serious and trustworthy man in front of them, no matter how strong, it is after all just the character of the game, the scar on the eyebrows is nothing to speak of the miserable past memories, just the accessories of the game set the face appearance.
Really deterrent is the countless rings and achievements behind the man.
The first to the top professional players.
The first to use the most difficult professional summon swordsman to the peak of the player.
Since the beginning of the first chapter "The Fall of Darkness", the Council, relying on its own abilities, and on the fear of familiarity with the whole profession, has swept through three entire information quarters, taking away all the bosses who killed the bosses.
Each copy of the video will be reproduced by countless players, dedicated to the teaching of the sacred existence of the first player of the mainland of the Dragons, the president of the board - - Rod.
He washed away the "dark coming", opened the "uncertainties", again conquered the "uncertainties", and came to the "uncertainties".
Now, he will once again use his hands to end this "empty trial", but, the new age, is no longer opened by himself.
It's been a few years?
Rod looked back from afar into the clouds of the dragon, and asked himself.
It's been seven years since his sister died, and in those seven years, in order to force himself to forget the painful past, he set himself almost unreachable goals once, and once again, and only the great excitement and glory of that time, can lighten the wounds left in his heart.
But it can only get there.
A month ago, Rod's parents were traveling abroad and were killed by a hurricane that caused the plane to crash. Rod had no idea how he felt when he first received the call, but now he had made a decision. to leave the game and return to real life, not just for his parents,
Rod was well aware that was the time to make a change.
"The meeting," said the president.
A timid voice broke Rod's memory, and he looked up, only to see a shy witch in the crowd, raising her hand, and staring at herself with shining eyes.
Are you really going to leave?
"Yes."
Rod nodded, then gathered his complex emotions, and he shook his head, and looked again at the companions who followed him, the friends of his seven years of recollection and of his seven years of struggle together.
But now he will leave them, though in the game, even with a single gesture, can be familiar to the extent of what the other wants to do.
But I'm afraid when I take off my game helmet and come back to reality, I can't recognize the other person anymore.
"My resume was sent yesterday and I hope to find a company that will accept me.
"If I get your resume, I will arrange for you to be the department manager.
A knight waved his large sword. His words also caused a somewhat dull atmosphere, and all laughed.
"Thank you for your kindness," I said, "but I didn't write it in my resume, because we had many enemies, and if they were received by the other members, my days would have been bad."
Rod laughed and answered, then he coughed and became more serious.
"I think everyone knows how we've come through these years.
Hearing this, all who had just laughed shut their mouths and began to listen quietly to his speech.
"We also know that on the forums, on the web, there are many people who are accusing us of breaking the balance of the game, of monopolising all the boss kills, and of making competition meaningful.
Frankly, I don't think that's wrong, but...
Saying this,Rod held his fist and waved.
"But what does it matter to us!We are the strongest council, we are the strongest team!We have this strength!So we have to do it, we have to take it!The other councils are not strong enough, to lose is their own problem, if they are strong enough, they will be able to break our monopoly, our monopoly on the bosses is not based on rules, it's not based on status, it's not based on the praise of the gaming company, it's based on our own strength!We've never given up, we've never conceded losses, we've never given up, so we've got what we've got now and everything, that's what we've got, that's how easy it is.
Rod stopped and went on.
"I love this meeting and I miss the seven years that we have spent together, but there are no endless feasts in the world, and I should be looking for my own life.
But I'll never forget all of you, and I'll never forget the meeting, where I carry my most painful memories, and also my most joyful memories, and I'll always remember it here.
said Rod, pointing at his head.
"Many people say I'm not going to play, and I think there are a lot of clubs now that know about this, and they think they're going to wait for me to go, and they're going to wipe out the club and break our record, but that's too small for us.
Dragons is not a game for me alone, I have no way to set up a community, I have no way to organize a team, nor is it possible to get the boss killed.
So I hope after I'm gone, you'll be able to take a good look at the guys who have the ghost idea, why this club is so strong, why our starlight is able to occupy the first real power of the Dragon Soul Continental club!
"Yes!"
"No problem, President!"
Give it to us, and then we will give the fools a perfect answer!
"It's good.
Hearing the answer, Rod nodded, then turned to the right of the crowd.
"Old Liu."
Hearing Rod's invitation, the tall witch went out of the crowd, came to his side, Rod looked at the witch in sight, paused, then reached out to take the badge from his chest, and placed it in his hand.
"The next generation is your generation."
Rod released his hand, and his voice was very calm, without any change.
"So, this battle is for you to command."
All right, Rod.
The Master nodded, but soon, he said again.
"Well, as the president, as the leader, I order you to lead the team."
"Old Liu?"
Hearing the answer, Rod frowned in surprise.
At this moment, in front of his thin physicist, but quietly smiled, then clapped Rod's shoulder.
"This is the time when you open up," "good starts good ends," "Rod," "that's the way of life."
..
When Rod heard this, he paused, and lifted his head, and looked at his companions, who were now ready, waiting for their orders as they had done before.
Rod, holding his sword, turned, and looked toward the high place, which was not far from his sight, where the thunder was raging, and there was a bright glow; and then Rod took up his long sword, and pointed forward, and he had had an ordinary beginning, and there was an ordinary end.
"It's crazy!"
The Dragon is indeed very strong.Rod had to deal with almost all of the top waves of the Dragon on the mainland, to the extent that there were other Dragons in the set, but there was not one more sophisticated than the present The The Dragon Dragon, its attack patterns were more complicated, almost irregular,
Its damage is several times higher than the normal wave, not to mention its speed, response, and even its defense.
This is indeed a difficult opponent.
Rod's hands with his long sword, his teeth clenched with his eyes fixed on the huge thing before him, the battle had reached its final end, and he was the only survivor, but even so, Rod's blood had been left without him, and the piercing red indicated to him that his own power had reached its limit.
What's wrong with the empty dragon?
Looking at the other's red, angry eyes, Rod had a strange feeling, as if he could feel the spirit of the empty dragon-as the most powerful, never conquered wave in the game, now falling into such a sudden downfall, it must be uncomfortable.
Then let me go with you.
Thinking about this,Rod raised his left hand.
Along with a loud cry, Rod's sword suddenly emitted a path of burning flame, they revolved in the form of a flying firebird, lifted up to the sky, thrust into the sight of the void dragon, and in the face of the coming attack, the void dragon also emitted a roar, and then raised his fore claws high, and fell violently.
Rhode felt his body shake, and a strong force washed over him, and the flaming bird washed away immediately after a cry, but before it disappeared, the strong explosion also made the empty dragon's claws, which had been waved, not work, but were shaken by the hard-being.
For a time, the open door.
Rod, biting his jaw, the brighter red of his eyes, suggesting that which he had suffered had reached a critical point, but now it was not within his scope of consideration,
This is the last chance either to succeed or to perish.
He took up his sword and struck it straight forward, but the empty dragon had now slowed down, and he roared, and then again cast out his claws, and at the same time Rod threw out his sword.
Lightning,start.
The Sword washed out the giant's chest, and Rod stared intently at it, looking at the glow of thunder from the gap between the giant's claws and then lightly tearing apart the giant's scales.
There was a deafening roar, and then a huge dragon claw was pressed against Rod's body.
The bright red almost covered the whole world, and Rod was no longer able to see the sight, but the system that emerged from the corners was still as clear as ever.
It's all over.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
Just then, a bright pillar came down from the sky, and enveloped the high place.
The pure white lighted the dark sky at that moment, and dissipated the clouds that had not gone.
Just as they were recovering from the grave, the others who were running to the high rise were suddenly stopped, and the world channel, which had been raging for the first time because of Starlight's record of killing, was suddenly quiet.
Once there was only one message left, which was a system announcement.
A legend that ruled the entire three game eras, thus ended.
Chapter 1 The New Journey
The wind blows through the valley and raises waves on the grass.
The cattle, which were bowing and eating the leaves of the green grass, lifted their heads and looked at the sky.
There was a wooden merchant vessel, several hundred feet long, floating in the air.
"Whatever you look at, the tide is so spectacular.
A middle-aged man, standing by the deck, looked down at this imposing grass and beauty.
It's a difficult business for us businessmen.
Standing beside the middle-aged man was a slightly fat merchant, with a strange curly hair, wearing the merchant's robe, with two small eyes squinting as if looking at the scenery before him,
Looking at him, it was as if even the sight in front of him could be taken to sell.
"I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to get the goods to the central area so quickly without it. "
"To tell you the truth, when I was planning to expand the market, I had some objections, but now it looks like my choice is really right.
"But, forgive me, you have not chosen a large route, but have gone from here, which may save you time, but which may increase the risk."
Besides, I think you've heard the captain warn, there seems to have been a snake out there recently, in case..."
The man's face wasted, and he turned his head, and turned his eyes to the near mountains.
The high clouds stopped him from seeing what was behind.
But rarely can be seen that far sky is not pure blue, but with a shade of darkness.
That's not the world they should be in.
"Don't worry," he said, "I've been hiring you for so long, because there's so much of it," he said.
There are only a few snakes, aren't there?
The merchant extended his hand and clapped the man's shoulder.
"Yes, but what about the young man who we rescued?"
Don't be dead yet.
"I've got a wound on him, and now he's asleep, and there should be no danger of his life."
It'll be fine.
Hearing the man's answer, the merchant nodded satisfactorily, but soon afterwards he frowned.
But what wound did the young man have, and from the wound it looked like a great lizard-but is there any strange thing in the north of Pafield?
"I don't know, sir, but it's supposed to be a very fierce beast, and I hope we don't meet it."
said the man, unconsciously sweeping the entrance of the cabin, then he turned again, looking forward.
Rod opened his eyes.
What's happened?
He stared blankly at the ceiling in front of him.
He remembers that he was supposed to lead the team on the ruined platform and fight the most powerful boss of the Dragon Soul, and successfully got the first kill, he is sure he got the achievement and the system, and then the last shot of the Dragon Dragon took his life.
As originally planned, Rod would be resurrected to the cemetery, and then go down the line.
But as soon as he was killed by the empty dragon, the whole world instantly turned into a darkness, as if forced to be isolated, and then Rod lost consciousness.
How is that possible?
What's wrong with the game?
Rod turned his head and saw from the window the blue sky and the white clouds outside, where was he?
What is this place?
What exactly happened?
Is he still dreaming?
Or are you still in the game?
At least Rod can be sure this place is definitely not his own small rented apartment.
Thinking of this, doubt immediately poured into Rod's heart, he frowned, then tried to sit up.
"Wow!"
Just then, a huge pain came out of Rod's chest, and he bit his toothbrush and stopped.
Only then did Rod find that his left shoulder and chest had been completely bandaged, although he did not know what had happened, but from the stain that was pervading above, he was clearly injured.
It's definitely not a game!
Rod can be sure of this, knowing that although technology is now quite advanced, as the world's first virtual all-round network, the Dragon is also using a lot of high-tech technology.
However, according to the rules, it is impossible for the player to experience pain, which is to separate the reality from the game, and also to reduce the threshold for the player.
Instead of pain, when a player is injured, the game uses a series of warnings and reminders that interfere with the player's normal game, such as blocking his eyes with a dangerous red, rather than simulating pain.
This behavior has caused considerable controversy in society since the emergence of full-spectrum imaging technology.
Rod lowered his head and looked at his right hand, which was not the role he had shaped in the game, not the one full of muscles and wild bodies.
On the contrary, this arm in front of us is thin and weak, because of the lack of sunlight in the year, the skin is somewhat diseased pale.
It's his body in reality, he's aware of.
But how did you get hurt?
And it's not like a hospital?
Rod looked up and the whole room looked like a cabin, with no lights, no telephones, no calls.
A wooden table, two chairs, and a cabinet fixed to the wall are all the homework here.
I don't know why Rod feels like he's seen the scene somewhere.
And it was when Rod looked at the room, that the door suddenly opened.
A blonde girl in her white dress entered the room, and looked at half-seated Rod, and opened her eyes to some surprise.
Are you awake?
That's good!
What the girl said was not Chinese or English, but Rod could clearly understand what she was saying.
This was surprising to Rod, who knew the language.
This is one of the official languages of the Dragon.
How are you feeling?
But the girl didn't care about Rod's expression, she quickly went to Rod's side, carefully examined his left shoulder and chest.
"Your wounds are so severe, frankly, that I am a little worried about you being able to hold on..."
"This is..."
Rhode frowned, but he didn't know what to say, and turned his head, and looked at the mirror beside the wall, where his face was clearly reflected, and that was indeed his face, but it shouldn't have been here.
Have you forgotten?
The blonde blinked her eyes with some suspicion, the tail on both sides also accompanied her movement slightly, the blue eyes clear, to give one a feeling of life.
"Two days ago, you fell in the hills of Pafield, and suffered a very serious injury.
"I'm afraid it would have been rather strange if the merchant vessel of the silver merchant hadn't passed by.
"I don't know what you're fighting with," he said. "It was a very dangerous time," he said.
Wait, left shoulder?
Rhode washed his eyes, and immediately thought, was it not the left that he had been attacked at the end of his battle with the Emperor?
But it's the player who's injured, and it shouldn't have anything to do with the player himself, but now it's the player who's injured?
Although the situation is a mess, but Rod quickly calm down, this is the psychological quality of him as a top player and the world's most powerful board president.
In his conversation with the blonde in front of him, Rhode also learned of his present situation, where he was heavily wounded in the plains of Pafield, and the silver merchant's floating vessel passed by and rescued him.
According to the blonde, Rod was not optimistic at first, but his recovery was quite good.
My name is Li, and I am a member of the Lunar Corps, a spirit,
Just call me Li.
The girl introduced herself to Rod.
My name is Rod Allen.
Although there was no way to settle the situation before, Rod was a little hesitant, and reported his identity and ID in the game.
"He's an adventurer from the Eastern Mountains."
Adventurer, that's why you're alone in such a remote mountain.
When she heard Rod's answer, she was not surprised, because on this continent there are many adventurers who like to explore on their own, so there was no big problem with the Rod's identity.
But what are you fighting with?
"Why do you get such a big wound?
"I remember there weren't any very scary monsters in this area," he said.
Hearing the girl's inquiry, Rod laughed a little hard.
What could he have said that he had been injured in a battle with one of the so-called Creation's Five Dragons?
"Because I was attacked at night, I didn't know what the other was, they were so many, and they were so fast, I thought, that maybe it was something over there.
"I understand.
Although Rod did not give any details, Li seemed to understand what was going on, then she examined Rod's wound carefully, and that was when she stood up.
"I don't have dinner for two days. I think you must be very hungry.
"Oh, yes, I have to report to the chief, and I think he will come to see you soon."
At the end of the saying, the girl was very polite, nodded to Rod, and then turned out of the room.
CHAPTER II
"Call..."
Only then did Rod grow up and lay back again.
After talking to the girl, Rod has been able to confirm that this is indeed the world of the Dragon.
Moreover, this is not the age I have experienced before, but a far more distant past-the year of the dawn, in the game time, that is, the time when the Dragon Age game has just begun to be announced.
How did you get here?
Rod sighed, shook his head, no more to think about these mysterious things, anyway, he has come here, it is a fact.
Then what should I do?
First, Rod decided to try what he could do at the moment.
He just thought about it, and soon a clear, familiar system was revealed, which showed exactly his present state and attributes:
Rhode
Level 1
Race: Mixed
Unresolved
Race Award
Racial Character: Unresolved ++
Profession: Caller (hero)
Vocational Skill
Hold Swords : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :
Part-time : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :
This is a very normal attribute, especially when you see the first one, Rod almost makes a sound.
Mixed? Why mixed?
Blood is not a common blood between races similar to Earth, on the contrary, it is common to have the characteristic of a common blood, most of which is produced by intermarriage between races other than humans.
But it was clear to Rod that he was a man, and that even in the role of the player, he had not chosen any other race.
But why do you now have more than one mixed blood? And the question mark behind the brackets represents that blood has not fully awakened, so race rewards and race characteristics are also sealed.
This means that Rod must understand what kind of blood he possesses and be able to gain after awakening the power of sleep in the bloodstream.
This can be a problem for Rod, because the general race reward is provided after the person is created.
Like humans, race rewards include shorter time to learn skills, and different additions according to race, such as anti-drugs, enhancement of reputation, etc.
But now, these rewards and characteristics are already isolated from Rod.
But it wasn't surprising either, because in the sword and alchemy column, Rod found that besides his level-required skills, the dozen sword and alchemy skills he had learned as a player weren't forgotten, but were quietly listed below, although they were all dark, indicating that he wasn't able to learn and use them at his current level of ability,
But it doesn't worry Rod, as long as his strength increases, after reaching the conditions, then can again get the use of these swords and skills.
Of course, the only shortcomings in the U.S. are that the skill of these swords and skills has also been restored to the lowest level E, not SS.
However, Rod did not keep these small things in mind, because the most important of these skills is not because of their proficiency, but because of their source, many swords are quite difficult to learn, not only need to upgrade or attributes, often to complete a series of tasks, or to raise their reputation, or simply to find hidden items.
It takes a lot of money, time, even luck.
In the game, until Rod's last year on the Dragon's Land, he had completely built up his own character, and thus had to challenge the grasp of the empty dragon.
Unfortunately, with joy, the problem of swordsmanship was solved, but Rod soon found that he was not only the experience, the rank and the skill, but also the most important thing for summoning swordmen-- summoning spirits.
In this game, summon swordsman is a contentious profession, at the beginning, it is an official launch, the player exclusive profession, and the attention of the public.
However, after being really good, summoning swords is considered one of the most addictive occupations by the players because of the combination of magic and the complexity of summoning spirits to accompany attacks, as well as the consumption of three aspects of experience during the upgrade process.
From a literal point of view, the summon of the swords and the summon of the witch seem to be no different, but in fact the two are distinct, the witch's summon is to consume their power, to tear space, to summon sub-level creatures, to use the power of magic to force them to serve themselves.
Unlike the summoned swords, they do not have the ability to tear up space, and all their summons come from the present world.
One ability is that by summoning the swords' unique "calling spells", they can re-awaken their souls from items that have a long history and are full of mystery and soul power, and use them to re- seal them in the form of a contract.
Although it sounds very strong, but there is a lot of trouble, in fact, at first many players were confused by this skill and chose to summon swords, in their opinion, as long as they buy back some damaged ancient objects at a low price in the remains or in the shop, then use summon spirits to summon the souls of those weapons, then they can get a deity without having to waste the power of ashes.
Unfortunately, dreams are beautiful, reality is cruel, not to mention the ancient level of weapons remains only high-level summoning spirits can activate their sleeping souls, and as souls they have lost their physical form, so the power is much weaker than was the original time.
It was only after he had completed his level that he extracted the soul from a weapon's remains, but the weapons that had accumulated at that time were no more powerful than those that the Forge Master had produced, and it took him two full years to run east to west across the Dragon's Land, before he was able to reactivate the soul of all the fragments on the weapon and restore it to its original form, not to mention the time, the brutality of the process, and enough for many to look back.
Furthermore, the use of spirit weapons requires the consumption of spirit power to maintain, and the summoned spirits also need the consumption of spirit power, but the summoned swords themselves reserve the spirit power far more than the wizards, so many summoned swords end up choosing ordinary weapons, and not using this "looks beautiful", but in fact does not much help the spirit weapons.
In addition to this, there are three sources of summoning spirits: one takes the core of the soul that is condensed after the death of the magic creature, and makes it its own summoning spirit.
However, this can change due to the owner's own attributes and the influence of factors such as the environment.
For example, if a summoned swordsman gets the core of the soul when he kills a fire snake, but he summons the soul in ice and snow or in any other environment, or in a dark-attributed outfit, then it is uncertain what kind of monster he will eventually summon.
If nine snakes have dark powers, it's good, but if it's the kind of ordinary monster that loses power because of its attributes, then it's just crying.
The second way to get a summoned spirit is to defeat the non-human creatures, who, after meeting certain conditions, can also sign a contract with them and seal them up for use as their own summoned spirits.
This is also a more common way of summoning swords, but the disadvantage is that this kind of summoning creature is too autonomous, and if it is in the game, the performance is likely to be against the order of its summoner based on its own judgment.
Of course, this will not be welcomed by anybody, after all, the more helpful the thing that does not want to summon itself.
As for the final method is to awaken attributes after the tenth level adjust the talent, by fusing several summoning spirits to produce higher spirits, this method to some extent controls the summoning spirit itself uncertainty, as long as you are familiar with the characteristics of summoning spirits, race, attributes, then for most of them to become what summon spirits after fusing.
But the disadvantage of this method is that the level of the newly created summoning spirit is uncertain, and it is possible to combine the two higher levels of summoning spirit, resulting in a new summoning spirit of the 1st level, and it is possible to combine a summoning spirit higher than the holder's level, which is unable to be used at all.
If the latter is good, just try to raise your level, if the latter is good, then you delete the number...
The Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master
Because of the characteristics of summoning the swordsman, it is also ranked among the top ten swordsman occupations in the official forum of Dragon's Land, and some have given the swordsman's operators an image of a person who plays summoning the swordsman, or the kind of bird who has never played a game, introduced and CG advertised to cheat in.
Or the kind of casual player that doesn't want to go up.
It's the gamblers.
And the last one is...
Rod.
Just by changing the game ID from a simple name to a phenomenon, you can learn what it feels like to be the first of countless servers to summon the Swordsman, the world-acclaimed father of monsters, when he has conquered three new eras.
Usually players don't like this kind of randomness, which gives them a feeling they don't have in their hands, but Rod likes it, because it's unknown and it's challenging, which is why he chose to call the swordsman.
In fact, in his long game career, all of the summons of the Swordsman's "Dad" showed that he had met almost all, but Rod was not tired, because only conquering such difficulties would make him more satisfied.
But now, he has spent a full seven years cultivating dozens of top summoning spirits, all cleared, and the mysterious summoning array on the back of his right hand still exists, but in it, Rod has not felt any trace of the spirits.
But it's no wonder that body is after all not the body of the game, and can not force too much.
But...
With this in mind, Rod did not move, and then he stretched out his hand, and touched his chest pocket, and, indeed, he soon touched a card.
It was a white card, depicted on it, a long sword, wrapped in thorns, and of pure white, engraved on it with complex and elaborate engravings, and guarded by a pair of delicate wings, which seemed only to give one a sense of delight,
There are four different marks in the four corners of the board, in the upper right corner, is a white half circle, and in the upper left corner is written a small X, and then looking down, the lower left corner and the lower right corner have two small numbers - 3.
Turn the card, a mysterious, elegant word slowly appeared on the back of the card.
[Eternal Sword,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is he still?
Looking at the card in his hand, Rod paused. It was the special equipment calling the swordsman, calling the card.
And this is also very familiar, this is the official gift of his rare card when he was participating in the game, after he won the first all-server for two consecutive quarters, in order to honor this incredibly strong top player, the game company specially created for him such a card.
Sure, there's been a lot of sea around cards like this, but for Rod, there's no such thing as wasting money on things you can't see, so he's got only this prize,
Of course Rod got it as a protective belt around, and it didn't take any place anyway.
Originally, it was a very ordinary souvenir except for one in the world, but at this moment Rod saw its surface shining in his hand with a faint light.
Would you like to try it?
Rhode hesitated for a second, then his right hand held the card, then the magic line attached to the back of Rhode's right hand suddenly lit up, and a blue magic line spread out from it, extending to every finger of the right hand, then the white card burst into bright white light, then became a little dust, and disappeared completely into the air.
And now a system appeared before Rod's eyes.
[Have received the Eternal Ring 1, The Eternal Sword 10 - Star Mark]
"Call..."

In the game, prior to level 15, it is rare to find weapons with +2 abilities, and "Star Trek" has the initial attribute of+3, which is enough to make the original summon swordsman semi-dead compared to the original swordsman.
In addition to its fusable characteristics, it means that as long as you find the right spirit, you can turn it into an attribute weapon.
Although the characteristics of calling cards that require the holder to consume the power of the soul to use, it is somewhat less than normal weapons, but only by means of attacking power, it is already a rare force equipment at present.
It's just hard for Rod to be completely excited, because for him, the situation in which he's involved, is very strange.
Is this a game?
Is It Real?
If it's real, then where do you go?
"Hmm."
A knocked on the door.
Rod looked up and saw a middle-aged man pushing into the door, dressed in an adventurer's jacket, with his long red hair casually trimmed back, and saw Rod, the man smiling slightly.
Hello, sir, I'm the commander of the Star-Saturn Mission, Carter.
Chapter Three
Hello, Mr. Carter.
Rod raised his head and smiled at the man before him.
"Thank you for your help."
"It's a labor, don't worry."
He was tall with red hair, and had a little bit of a backward comb, and he should have been born in the northwestern part of the country as a Lecat.
Two long swords hung quietly on both sides of his waist. The firmness and discernment revealed by the sharp edges of his face could prove that this man was not an ordinary man.
While Rod looked at the other, Cat was quietly assessing the man before him.
It's easy to think of him as a kind of uneducated noble brother, and it's no wonder that his weakness, his pale skin, and his long, somewhat womanlike face, and his clothes, make him look no more than an adventurer on an outward journey, but more like a rich two-generation who go out all day to seek stimulation and play.
But Carter thinks the young man doesn't seem to be so simple, and for that reason, he's on his right back with the strange and mysterious formula.
Liz, a psychic, could feel the magic from there, indicating that was not a commodity, but with all the years of experience with Card, he rarely saw anyone directly inscribe a magical array on his body.
As you can see, the identity of this young man is not easy.
Moreover, from the previous short conversation, Carter noticed that the young man's attitude was neither arrogant nor lowly, and his expression was very calm.
Listen, said Li, for a few dozen minutes since he was awakened from his drowsiness, he was able to grasp his present state so calmly, and for that alone, he was more than the ignorant, arrogant, noble sons.
"I hear you come from Eastern Mountains?"
"Yes."
Rod nodded.
Then where are you going?
"I'm just traveling around.
Rhode shrugged.
"I'm an adventurer, and it's my life to venture freely.
Of course, please rest assured, I will not bring any trouble for you.
It'll be fine.
Now that's been said by Rod, Carter hasn't spoken much, they're still on their mission, and naturally they don't want to do anything new.
So, after a few more words to make him feel better, Carter said nothing more, and soon quit, after all, he had much to do as a commissioner, and it was not possible to always waste time here.
The next few days were relatively uneventful for Rod, who was somewhat interested in what she had brought, although it was only ordinary white bread and dried meat, and Rod had eaten many times in the game, but it was "false" and only served to restore the character's life and spirit, without any flavor or filling.
Now it's a fresh experience to experience the taste of white bread and dried meat in a food comment.
But I have to say that tastes better than what is described in the notes.
"How do you feel? Is the wound still sore?"
Sitting on Rod's side, the blonde with anxious and serious expression, looked at the young man in front of him, with a little of anxious eyes on his shoulder, a little unbearable.
It's all right now.
' said Rod, holding his left hand, and the pain from his chest was not so intense at first, and at first he felt a little difficult even to breathe, but now he was much better.
It'll be fine.
When she heard Rod's answer, her nervous expression was much more relaxed.
"But you still need to rest," he said. "When we get to deep rock city, the conditions will be much better," he said.
The girl's expression was very serious, though lying in front of herself but a stranger who had just met, but looking at her expression, it was evident that she did not care about this little idea.
"Thank you.
Don't be rude. That's what I should have done.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So..."
Liz did not say anything, because at that moment, the ship was shaken.
The girl's body wasted, and she fell into the bed, but at the last moment she stretched out her hand, and lifted her head from the bed.
The two looked at each other saw from the eyes of the other.
Although aerial vessels operate by the power of the winds, and the sky is not like the ocean, there are no dark reefs, there is not necessarily any danger.
The situation is obviously not normal.
I'll go see. You can rest here.
Leigh said in a low voice, then immediately turned away, closed the door, and looking at her back, Rod smiled, and opened his mouth, but said nothing.
Is it necessary to speak to yourself in such a way as to make children look like her?
But the next moment, a figure flew from outside the window, but made the look of Rod suddenly become serious.
He turned his head slightly and stared carefully outside the string window.
Soon, three four green figures flew from outside, and at the same time, a low noise seemed to appear.
"I-"
But when he heard this, Rod washed himself.
They're in trouble!
At this moment, the deck is already a mess.
"I didn't think we'd come across these dead things.
The commander of the Red, with his swords, stood in front of him, looking solemnly at the green figures that flew around the floating ship.
Their appearance looks like a snake of bat wings, about one meter long, although the slightly weak body gives one a feeling of weakness without wind, but the sharp poison teeth revealed from the open mouth can overturn the conclusion in the shortest time.
The Wind.
"It looks like we've broken into the snake's territory.
The fat merchant lurked beside the captain of the mercenary, whose pale, shivering handkerchief wiped the sweat from his forehead.
Damn it, that cunning Bick, I knew, I knew that bastard would give me such a way, but with so little money!
It's a murder!
When I come back, I must let him know how great I am!
Wait for us to get out of the circle and say again!
Carter interrupted the fury of the fat merchants near Heathrow, and looked at the hundreds of wind-snakes that surrounded the merchant ship, and at the outset ordered his men to use the crossbows to try to frighten the monsters.
But the spirit of "death as a return" is truly beyond his imagination, or that the death of his companions instead provoked the cruelty of these monsters, now that they have occupied the outer side of the deck and are beginning to penetrate inside.
And the mercenaries had thrown away their bow and began to wrestle with each other by waving their arms.
You hide inside and tell the captain we need to get out of here as soon as possible!
Carter pushed the fat merchant back into the captain's room. Then he took the first two steps, his long sword waving a piece of snow, and knocked down a roaring snake, but quickly the second one jumped up.
There are too few people!
Carter frowned, swept over the deck, and this time he had only six men on his mission, and these six men, although the merchant vessel itself had guards, had little experience.
Looking at those terrible monsters, Cart's face froze.
He didn't have any experience with the Snakes, but it was the first time that he had seen such a number, and it made Carter feel a little nervous.
He made another half-step, turned his body flexibly into a half-circle, then cut his sword sharply to the side, and heavily struck the snake, and under the splash of blood, the wounded snake fell heavily on the ground, and after a few unpleasant hisses, it became a cold corpse.
Carter lifted his head, consciously glanced around, and then his heart blew.
"Lizzy!
Be careful!
The girl did not respond at first.
Having just healed herself from therapist, she had just taken off her hands, and the girl's mentality was a bit of an ecstasy, for she had only been on the deck for a few minutes, but had had a number of injured, and as the only healing spirit among them, she had taken on her responsibilities, naturally, with a great deal of grace.
After hearing Carter's warning, the girl turned her head in confusion.
Then what she saw was a big, open mouth with sharp, poisonous teeth.
In that moment, the girl's blood froze, she stared at the wind snake in front of her, brain blank, completely unknown how to react.
In her eyes, Li had a clear sight of sharp, shining, poisonous teeth, and of the flesh-the inner wall, even of the smell.
At this moment, a hand suddenly stretched from behind, grasped Lijee's collar, and pulled her away at the moment of a sudden.
Chapter Four
The Snake bit the air.
It was nearly there, had it not been for Rod's sudden appearance from behind.
"Mr.
Liz, who had escaped from death, lifted her head, and was surprised to find that Rod was standing behind her, and she was leaning in the arms of the other, not knowing whether it was because of the overwhelming fear, that the girl at this moment found herself underneath all the softness, not half the strength.
She consciously wanted to stand up, but a soft leg, but instead sat down.
"Lie!"
Seeing her escape from her death, Cat also relaxed, but soon, his heart again became tense.
For now the flying snake had turned its head, opened its wings, raised its head, and intended to attack again.
Damn!
He grabbed his sword and ran to the two, hoping to get there-but he didn't seem to get there anyway.
Looking at the snake again, the girl inadvertently shut her breath, she wanted to do something, but did not know what to do.
As a spirit, she does not use weapons, and does not carry arms around.
Well, what now?
Give it to me.
Just as Lizzy wasted, her ears heard the sound of Rod, and then the girl saw Rod coming halfway up, standing in front of herself.
Was he going to fight the wind snake with a blank hand?
Just as Li was wondering, she saw Rod extending his right hand.
It was then that Li noticed that on Rod's right hand, a complex, gorgeous array was shining bright magic, a line spreading from it to every finger, a semi-transparent, card-like thing emerging from the centre of Rod's palm.
Afterwards, Rod held back his hand.
A white brightness suddenly appeared.
The Invisible Power unlocked the seal and turned into a shaped wave of air spreading all around. The first wind snake screamed at the tip of its wings, trying to keep balance in the midst of this fierce wind.
But before he could make any further moves, a brilliant light came out of the waves, heavily cut on the body of the wind snake, and blown it away completely.
"Call..."
Rhode washed his mouth, and at this moment the glory of his eyes washed away, and his right hand was replaced by an exquisite, transparent, white sword.
He waved the dust sword in his hand, point dust slowly descending from the sword, for a time created an enchanting scene.
He didn't notice, and the others were now completely frightened.
Leigh sat still on the ground, looking at the man standing before her, and Cart slowed down, looking at Rod with astonishment and astonishment, though he had already noticed that the other was not ordinary, but had never thought that he would be so "ordinary".
Even though she still sat on the ground, she couldn't help admiring the long sword, which was clean and unblemished, with the old-fashioned prints on the long sword, and with its weak light, and even around it, with its clear spots of dust, which were as beautiful as illusions, and with its curved wings, which were as exquisite as ever,
Even a piece of feather is clearly visible.
Although women don't always get cold about weapons, this sword has far exceeded the scope of weapons, and even art.
Lizzy was only appreciating, but Carter's eyes at this moment were a little different.
As an experienced adventurer, he can swear by heaven that he had never seen such a strange thing, and in fact he was stuck when Rod summoned the weapons, and although he had seen some wizards summon, most of them used the existence of crystals,
And you need tos some ancient spells and then summon some ugly monsters, which you see a lot.
But what about summoning weapons? He didn't really see such a scene.
Although it was not clear what was in Rod's hands, it was clear to Carter that this magical weapon could not be used by ordinary people, and that the person who could be qualified to use it must be a noble and special person.
And when he saw the living wings of the sword, he wrinkled his eyes.
He was, of course, clear that on this continent, angels are a very noble group, most of whom are distinguished, or are the strongholds of certain important groups.
It's like three years ago the lord of the Principality of Muen, Lydia Pafield, Mira, and Florence, who's an angel.
Although the young man does not know his true identity at present, the sword can be used to determine that he must have some connection with that noble group.
These thoughts were just flashing through Carter's mind, when he had come to the two.
"It's all right.
I'm still fine.
Leigh's little face was still pale, which could not be blamed for her timidity; after all, had it not been for Rod's pull from behind, the girl would have been dead.
That fear of escaping under the sickle of the dead is certainly not the experience of ordinary people.
After confirming that Liz was not injured, Carter immediately shifted his eyes to the next Rod.
You're all right, Mr. Rod.
Rod shook his head, indicating that he was all right, although his left body suffered in the course of the movement, it had little effect on the fight.
Instead, he cared more about one thing than about his own body.
What are you going to do?
There were more and more snakes around, and even though the floats were moving at full speed, they were still not able to escape most of the snakes' attacks.
Their situation is not improving, it is getting worse.
"We're going to push out of their territory, and until then we've been able to keep going. "
If it were on land, it might be that Carter had a different way of dealing with the problem now that he was in the air, he would have no better way of dealing with the problem now.
But as soon as the Cards came out, the young man in front of him froze.
"I can't come," said Mr. Carter.
"Oh?"
"The wind snakes are absolutely superior in the plains, and even if you speed up, we have no way of getting out before the float breaks down. "
Really?
Carter was not stupid, and made the decision because he himself was not familiar with the place.
As soon as he heard Rod speak, he immediately understood the gravity of the matter.
What should we do then?
"Go down now."
Rod gave the answer almost without hesitation, then he stretched out his hand, pointing to the side.
"And then we'll go in there.
Carter looked in the direction of Rod's fingers, then he opened his eyes to some surprise.
"You mean we're going to the forest at dusk?"
"It's our only way to get rid of the wind snake, and..."
said he, and looked around.
We don't have much time.
The situation is indeed deteriorating.
Their threat is not only their poisonous teeth, which are also deadly with their corrosive toxins, but they are also thin, and they will change their targets immediately if they are unable to win a direct attack.
Now there are many wind snakes breaking glass and drilling into the cabin from below, but in the face of such a situation, there is no way to resist.
Although the small space in the cabin limits the flexibility of the wind snakes, their threat does not decrease as a result.
For this reason, now that there was a wolf in the cabin, as can be seen from the thick smoke that came out of several holes,
Things are pretty bad now!
Carter did not hesitate and turned away immediately.
Rhode grabbed the stars and blocked the gap in front.
"Hoh!"
A Wind Snake flew from the right, and opened his mouth to attack Rod, but just as he was about to come, Rod had already shifted to the left, and at the same time the white long sword of his hand had struck the wind Snake's lower jaw, and he had struck the wind Snake's lower jaw at the same time as he had blocked the poison sprayed by the other in a hurry.
Then Rod turned quickly, and the silver in his hand carried a curtain in the air, and correctly inserted another sword on the wings of the wind snake, which tried to steal from behind, while it lost its balance, and completely ended the life of the poor snake.
But the Snakes' attack did not stop, and the blood was surely stimulating them, and as Rod drew out his long sword from the dead Snake, dozens of Snakes rushed towards him, and they overlapped,
From a distance it was like a green cloud, and like a big mouth open by some unknown monster, which in a moment could completely swallow the prey in sight.
"Mr. Rod!"
To discharge the poison to another, Li, turning, saw the scene, she cried out unconsciously.
A showered out like a rain on Rod, who was afraid of not dying and of losing half his life if it were poured out.
But at this moment, Rod stepped back.
Acid washed over him, dropped on the deck, emitted a little smoke, and corrupted the little holes, but almost at the same time the swarms of wind snakes were running before Rod, and at the next moment they were going to tear apart the dangerous existence before them.
If you were an ordinary man, you'd have seen the scene before, I'm afraid the frightened legs were already soft, but Rod was very calm, faced with the monsters who threw themselves in front of him, trying to tear themselves apart.
The only thing he did was to raise his sword with his right hand and then tos it forward.
Break the blade, start.
The white blades burst out of the swarms of wind snakes, one for two for four, and several of them flew forward, and struck one after another of the wind snakes, and the sweeping strong wind, as if it were an invisible hand, dragged those who were lucky not to be hit, and crumbled their bodies coldly and mercilessly.
Almost in one instant, the green cloud was thus completely torn apart by the brilliant, leaving only a piece of blood.
Everyone stopped breathing at that moment.
Chapter Five
Their fierce attacks were slowed down, but there was such a moment of silence on the deck, filled with anger, screams, and screams.
Everyone looked at the young man with incredible eyes, not knowing exactly what to say.
At that moment, almost everyone thought the young man was dead, they had never seen any man who could withdraw from the siege of dozens of wind snakes.
Of course, that's what high-ranking professionals, or full-armed shield fighters, say.
But the young man doesn't seem to be very old, and he doesn't have any protective equipment at all except for the white long sword in his hand.
But he did.
At this moment, not only the mercenaries, but even Lejee and Cart looked at the young man, with his heart shaking.
Why is he sacred?
It wasn't known if, being deterred by Rod's attack, all the wind-snakes who were still trying to attack the floating ships were dispersed, and at one point, the whole deck was almost silent except for the whistling wind.
The mercenaries were shocked by Rod's performance, but for Rod he didn't care what he had done; on the contrary, at this moment he looked at the pile of bodies beneath his feet, and in his heart he cried out for danger.
Although the Snake is one of the lowest level of monsters, the power itself is not particularly strong, but after all it is a monster that wins by number.
Rod's summoning swords belong to the single-brush profession, but large-the single-brush is not effective, and in fact this is so successful, mainly because of the initial +3 characteristics of his hand, which means that when holding this sword, Rod's characteristics can be raised by three points, three points raised enough to bring the danger level of a monster down from red to green, so for Rod, the elimination of the wind snake falls is not particularly surprising.
But it was a strange thing to think of it, that if it were a human attribute, then even if it had a "streak of stars," it would not have been the autumn wind that wiped out the leaves, and that it would have been the overwhelming advantage, according to his original estimate, that the most crushed blade would have been to sweep the blood out of the swarm of wind snakes, and so he was well prepared to go up and get the sword.
But without thinking about the power of the broken blade far beyond his own imagination, and to sweep the wind snake directly to death?
Aren't their attributes calculated according to human?
With this in mind, Rhode unconsciously removed his attribute table, but unfortunately, his attributes were hidden and unable to be checked before his race had been identified.
Fortunately, this battle gave him a 1900 point of experience, which was surprising to Rhode.
Of course, it was only a few seconds for Rod, who seemed to be just staring at the pile of bodies beneath his feet, silent for a moment, then raised his head again.
And it was at this moment that Rod found himself surrounded by ancient silence, not by the shock of others, but by some more dangerous, deadly existence.
What about the Snakes?
This thought flickered through Rod's mind, and then he seemed to think of something, and hastened to turn and to shout.
Everybody be careful!
At this moment, the floating vessel was shaken.
Severe shocks caused many people to fall directly to the ground, and even two wicked devils did not come to stand, directly lost feet, slid down.
At the same time, the deck of the ship emitted a crisp crack, and immediately, a huge snake head came out of it.
"Be careful, it's the Lord of the Winds!"
At last Carter appeared, he drank aloud, then drew out the swords of his hand, and flew past the giant wind snake.
The other servants stood up in a hurry, and although they were already wounded, they were still clinging to their teeth, following their leader, and trying to attack the great thing.
But Rod's moving faster than all of them.
He squatted, and a row of instructions immediately appeared before him.
[1900/200,,,,,,,,]
[Experience Point 1 700,,,,,,,,,]
[Experience Score 1300 600]
[800/1000,,,,,]

Start.
Rod stood up.
At that instant, all felt only a flower, and then saw a young man who had stood on the ground transformed into a black shadow, as if a blade had been cut across the sky, before even the great wind-snake commander could react, and when Rod jumped up and came before him, the other had even manifested some suspicion--it was evident that he had never encountered a strange situation in which the prey had jumped up and gone to his mouth.
Rod took up his long sword, and at that moment the glow of the dust as if attracted by the invisible gravity washed up on the white and vacant body of his sword, and then he struck down the brass-bell-sized eyes of the Lord of the Wind-Snake.
"Broken Blade!"
Faced with the light of the sword, the master of the wind snake's first reaction was to evade, after raising the sword of the moon continuously four proficiency, the blade of the broken, both in quantity and in strength, has risen more than one step, dozens of silver and white light blades in that instant burst out of the sword, circling the shot forward.
One, Two, Three.
At first, the Snake Master's hardened scales barely resisted the first blade of the sword, but even with his master's level of protection, only to insist on twenty sword marks completely collapsed.
Then came the sword light and easy to tear the scales and the flesh, and pierced its body.
Although the Snake had a large body, Rod was very clever in choosing a break, and under his control, the blade did not disperse as before, but concentrated on the neck of the other, and successfully broke the defense of the other.
Their Master raised his head, staring dead at Rhode, and then opened his mouth.
Rod's shadow, once again turned into a hallucination, and as he retreated away, a poison of an immense smell came straight up, wiping through Rod's remains, spraying on the rear mast, and soon, under the corrosion of that poison, the mast, which had been rough and hard, melted completely in just a few seconds, and then collapsed.
After all, BOSS is.
According to Rod's experience, the average level of the Snake is about three, and its leader is usually ten, and the nearest BOSS should not be more than ten.
Although it was not difficult to defeat the BOSS by means of the covering of Card and the mercenaries, after the sword, Rhode realized that it was probably not an ordinary master level monster, but an elite, after all, if it was an ordinary master monster, Rhode's sword was sufficient to cut off its wings.
But in fact, despite all that Rod had done, he had left only a deep-seated scar, which was very clear about the problem.
Go attack its wings and keep as close as possible to its mouth!
Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord
Previously healed left chest now burning pain, seems to have ruptured again.
If there were any deaths due to the destruction, then it would be a joke that would not make anyone cry.
And even though he's only 5 now, for Rod, as long as the other player's level is no more than 15, he's confident in the fight.
After all, there are three occupations in the Dragon's mainland, which are known for their superior brush, magicians, travelers, and the last one is summoning swords.
Magicians are known for their magic, and they are powered by "flying kites" at great distances, and they are powered by "flying kites" at great distances at great distances at great distances are known for their magicians are known for their magicians are known as the greats are known as the greats are known as the greats are known as the greats are known as the great is known as the great is known as the great is known as the great is known as the great is known as the great is known as great is known as great as great is known as great as great Grand Masters are known as great as great Grand Masters are known as the great Grand Masters are known as the Grand Master, and Grand Master is known as the Grand Master, and Grand Master is known as the Grand Master, Grand Master, Grand Master, Grand Master, Grand Master, Grand Master, Grand Master, Grand Master,
Nevertheless, these three occupations have their disadvantages—the wizards with no magic are no different from the targets, and even a group of low-level fairies can beat them to death, and the approach of the wizards is a complete tragedy, and the summoning of the swords is too random, and the operations are too complicated, to the point where there are almost no models to follow.
That's why the three professions didn't reach the clouds in the game, and that's what's closer to the real-life setting of the Dragon-either betting on a non-routine path, or on a steady slow path, where players can decide their fate and their future at their own discretion.
The Lord of Nights is the ten-class elite BOSS, but because of the marks he holds in his hand, it has a maximum of defense of less than sixty-seven degrees, so that in defense, Rod does not worry about sufficient damage, but in attack...
"Come!"
The fierce wind lifted.
Rod's body washed away with a series of remains, and he was able to avoid the wings of the other.
And when the wings were blown, they fell upon the deck heavily, and immediately the hard and thick deck fell into a great hole.
It's worthy of the 10th class.
Rhode wiped his cold sweat, and he was only fifth, and he had no equipment, and if he was wiped like this, I was afraid that even the King would not be saved.
Although he's also worried about Cats and others, but fortunately for the moment, it's probably because he's done a lot of damage to it. He's obviously putting all his hatred on himself, and unfortunately he's been watching a BOSS with such a high attack power, and for a non-tank career, the pressure is really great...
His Soul Power had been reduced to a third, and Rod was feeling a little tired, and although he had expected the battle to be difficult when he saw the Lord of the Winds, the pressure was too great, and he needed a flash to help himself escape the attack, for at his present speed, to escape the attack of the Lord of the Winds was a matter of night and day.
But on the other hand, he also needs a broken blade to cause damage to overcome the intractable existence in the shortest time.
But it doesn't look like it's going to be easy.
The floating vessel was slowly lowering its altitude, but under the attack of the Lord of the Winds, it was occasionally swinging, like a small boat in the waves, it was discouraging.
There were already two commissioners so they were thrown out of sight.
Carter was still trying to drive out the Snake Master, his swords dancing in front of him, flexibly attacking the Snake Master's side, but was unsuccessful.
I'm afraid they'll have no way to keep up until now, if it wasn't for the healing light that Lizzy gave the mercenaries from time to time.
There must be a way, or else, before the float falls, I am afraid it will be torn apart by this damned snake.
Thinking about it,Rod bit his lips.
Their attack was not weakened, and their wings were extended, and the two claws on the upper edges of the boat were caught dead on the edges.
Although Rod's previous attacks caused him considerable damage, as a lord-level monster, he is of course unable to retreat due to this injury.
On the contrary, the cunning Snake Master seemed to have noticed the weakness of the enemy in front of him, and two sharp claws grasped deadly the outer wall of the floating ship, shaking and dragging the prey in his hand.
Although the hull was not so fragile, it was already heavily damaged in the previous battle with the Snake Group, and the whirling tide hit the hull, causing it to begin some distortion.
Even on the deck there were several striking cracks, which gave rise to a chilling crack.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh!
Benched in the corner of the captain's room, the fat merchant stared with trembling, outward, at the terrifying wind-snake master, whose voice had become somewhat distorted by tension and fear.
"That damn Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard
And you too! What is so terrible that you don't wake me up?
The captain didn't respond to the fat merchant's rage. He was now holding the rudder and staring straight ahead.
At the same time, deep in his heart, he cursed the goddamn scoundrel, before reminding him that this time of the voyage is very likely to attract the swarm of wind snakes, but the guy didn't think.
It's all right now, when death comes, he's blaming himself! He knew it was going to happen, and he shouldn't have taken this job at first!
CHAPTER VI
It's awful.
Both Rod and Cat had the same thought at this moment, that it was very difficult for the lord of the snake to be involved, that although the float was falling rapidly, and that it could be seen clearly in the forest of nowhere, that as it went, I was afraid that the float had not yet come down to the ground, and that it would be dissolved in the air!
Drink!
Before Cat flew, the two swords in his hand crossed the air two cold lights, directly hit the giant claws of the Lord of the Winds, but just before he got the hand, the Lord of the Winds suddenly opened his mouth, Cat felt only a smell of coming on the face,
Before he could even confirm it, he rolled straight away, despite escaping the whisper of the Snake Master, but also proclaiming the defeat of the attack.
But just as Carter stood up and tried to get out of the space, the Snake commander seemed to find the little insect too annoying, and all of a sudden a claw hit him.
Carter, who had no expectation of the Snake's master's release from the ship, was somewhat uncomfortable, and consciously lifted his swords to resist, but was blown away by the weight.A few meters after slid on the deck, it hit the mast, and stopped.
You can't go down like this.
'Rod frowned, then looked at the anxious girl standing not far behind.
I need your help!
"Oh?"
"I will draw its attention, and when it attacks me, I hope you can give me a protective shield!"
All right!
When she heard Rod's words, she did not hesitate to raise her head.
She held her hands tight, bright soft light floating now on her body.
Seeing this scene, Rod said nothing more, he turned his head, then raised his long sword, and thought of stabbing him.
Broken Blade.
The S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
Theraptor's action was sharp, and he turned quickly, his red eyes burning with anger, staring dead at the young man on the deck, and then he opened his mouth again, and flew to Rod.
The Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind
He deliberately did not use flashes, but kept moving at a slower pace, in order to tempt the Snake's leader to take the initiative, although this would be a great danger, but when the enemy attacks at its full strength, its weaknesses would be evident - this was the opportunity that Rod wanted to seize!
The Lord of the Wind Snake's bowels were near, and as soon as a few more seconds, Rod would be swallowed by it, but it was still unable to achieve its goal.
For at this moment, a pale, shining, egg-shaped barrier appeared upon Rod, and blocked the Lord of the Winds' teeth, which, though the Lord of the Winds had slowed down, at the next moment had completely broken the barrier, but it had not bit anything.
Because it's when the guardian's shield is covered, Rod has already started the flash.
He, like a ghost's shadow, flew past the snake's master's bite, then lifted up his pure white sword, and cut it from his throat.
This is the weakness of the master of the wind snake, and is the most vulnerable part of its body up and down, but before it is one is shrinking its neck, so it is difficult to attack.
And this time, the Lord of the Winds, angry with Rhode, was completely disengaged from the attack, and for that reason, he had no more time to protect himself from the deadliest weakness.
There was a sharp cry, and the Lord of the Winds seemed to have been electrocuted, and he generally raised his head, and in his throat, a stain of blood poured out, and filled the whole deck.
Then, as soon as its body was soft, it fell so heavily on the deck that there was no more breath.
Just then, Rod saw a deep green, expanding rapidly before his eyes.
"Bow!"
Then he felt a trembling of the ship, and his body seemed to float in the air for a moment.
Afterwards, in the darkness of Rod's eyes, he completely lost consciousness.
When he woke up again, the first thing he felt was a chill.
"I am..."
Open eyes, first reflected in eyes, is a beautiful night sky.
Unlike ordinary nights, these nights are very bright, and gentle moonlight shines down, reflecting the shadows of each leaf on the ground.
In the night sky, apart from the dot stars, there was a path of light in which they converged to form a light cord, extending on all sides.
This is the characteristic of the dragon-according to ancient legends, it was originally a chaotic, dangerous space.
Then five giants came here, and they created heaven, earth, and all things with their own bodies in this space that was originally empty.
In order to suppress the evil chaos, the five giants, after creating the world with the body, they also put their souls into it, to suppress the evil chaotic power, and to protect the order of the world.
Each dragon's spirit has its own unique form, as if the sky above Rod's head now represented a protective area belonging to the dragon's spirit of light.
Its characteristic is that even in the darkness, there will be light shining.
In contrast, there is a protective area of the dark dragon, where, even during the day, there is a darkness, and no light shadow can be seen.
For this reason, the distribution of species on the mainland is also quite regular.
In the area guarded by the dragon soul, you can see the growth of various green plants.
But in the dark dragon's soul can only see the traces of the plants of the night.
Of course, this characteristic also affects the distribution of races on the continent, most of whom are gathered under the guardianship of the dragon spirits of light, followed by spirits and angels.
Deaths, Vampires, and Nightmares are the natural inhabitants of the dark kingdom.
There is no divinity on this continent, and if it is hard to say, then the five giants of heaven and earth are the objects they believe in.
Likewise, this includes the holder of the dragon spirit.
Souls have their core, even the giants who create the world, and their soul core, will lodge in a person, and this person can use this power to adjust the dragon soul's guardianship of the continent.
For example, if chaos is a virus, and the power of the dragon is a firewall, then the person holding the core of the soul is the same as the CPU, and as long as the CPU is still capable of computing, the firewall will not fail, sufficient to completely prevent all the power of chaos from going out into the world.
Those who hold the core of these souls are also considered to be the inheritors of the souls of the giants.
But this doesn't mean anything to Rod now.
Rod rose slowly, and his body washed with intense pain, especially his left chest wound, which now seemed to be more serious.
Before, Rod was able to move with his left hand, but now he can't move even with his finger, and feels like his whole arm is buried in the sea of pain.
But this puts Rod down, feeling that his arm is still, if anything doesn't feel, that's the big trouble.
Raising his head, through the bright moonlight, Rod first saw the remains of the floating ship, and the tall trees around them showed that they were in the forest.
And then it's clear what's happened.
Despite Rod's killing the master, the already fragile float was destroyed while falling due to its inability to withstand severe impact.
There was silence in the forest, and not even the sound of the insects could be heard, and Rod looked around, and saw only on the ground, where there were signs of blood and bodies, of wind snakes, and of men.
And not far from Rod, there lay a delicate figure, which did not move.
"Lie!"
Rod rushed to the girl's side, fell to look at her situation, fortunately, the girl looked pale, hands tight.
But her breathing was even, and under Rod's call, not too long the girl opened her eyes.
"I..." "I am..."
She opened her eyes, and looked at the man in front of her, and after a while she seemed to have recovered, and it seemed that she had fallen too little.
Am I still alive?
"Yes," he said.
Looking at her reply, Rhode put down his mind, and the girl slowly stood up, shaking her head, gripping her lips, as if she had not fully recovered; but for the girl there was something more important to do.
What about all of you?
What about the chief?
Rod didn't answer, but Li did not need to answer, because at this moment she had seen clearly the situation around her.
The little face, which was originally pale, now looked extremely stiff.
"How can..." "Crit," "Sar," "Commander!"
The girl rushed to the corpses of the mercenaries and cried out for their names, but no one responded.
However, Liz did not give up, she squatted down, carefully examined the commissioner before her, and after confirming the other had died, she did not cry, but bite the toothbrush, and ran to the next one.
However, the girl's efforts have not received their due.
She couldn't do anything in front of those bodies that were already cold and stiff.
Despite her persistence, when she saw the figure of Carter, she was unable to soften her feet and sit down.
Formerly thermal commissioner, now also a cold corpse.
Half of his body washed away in the gap of the deck, and a cracked pile passed through his belly.
"The group...
Commander..."
Looking at the scene, Li Li sat still on some wet grass, the hopeful seeds had been completely extinguished from her eyes, and in her place, was confusion and sadness.
Finally, the girl lowered her head, though she did not speak, but the little cry that was brought by the night wind, passed on to Rod's ears.
Looking at the little blonde's shivering shoulder, Rod stood silently behind her, but could not say a word.
Previously in combat, for reasons of life and death, he didn't care about these at all. But now, when everything was over, looking around at the bodies, Rod was unable to feel complicated.
He didn't see the body, but after all it's just a simulation of the game, where the dead can be resurrected by magic, or the soul can run away,
But this isn't a game. people die and don't come back to life.
dead, dead.
At this moment, Rod seemed to recall the night of seven years ago, when he could only watch with open eyes, but was powerless-death passed by him steadfastly, but he could not even stop it.
Just as he was about to say something to comfort the girl in front of him, suddenly, a faint cry came.
"Hey.
"Are there any?"
Chapter 7
Meas, awkwardly sitting by the fire, the fat face revealed helplessness and sadness, he wanted to burn, but did not know who to burn.
On the other side of the pile, Rod was quietly leaning on the trunk, keeping his eyes closed.
Li Ji was preparing her food, and though her expression seemed to be calm, the red eyes were telling her everything
Unknowing whether he was lucky or not, he was the only lucky man in the disaster, except for Rod and Leigh. As a businessman who often goes out, he had some saving magical tools, and before the fall of the floating ship, the protective decoration in his hands showed its good and stable function, so that the fat businessman was instead the least injured of the three--
Rod himself hasn't been hurt before, after such a fierce fight, plus the wounds, add to the snow frost.
And there's nothing good about Lizzy, which she didn't find until she was nervous, and it wasn't until it was all over, that people found out that she had not only dislocated her right arm, but had also hurt her leg.
Only fat merchants except for a bit of scratch outside, the head is hit by a drowning, everything is normal.
If you replace the ordinary people, the wound is enough to make them go to bed for months.
Luckily, Liz is a full-time spiritualist, and healing is her guide, and under Liz's treatment, all three of the wounds have improved, but Rhode still needs a period of rehabilitation to be able to recover completely.
But it was a good news for him, to know that with his original wounds, combined with such a fierce fight, at least not to die and also to be disabled.
But now Rod's limbs are healthy, and besides the injuries that make the movement not flexible, everything is not the same as the ordinary, which is quite surprising, after all, since they rescued Rod, it's always been her to take care of Rod, so for his injury, Lizzy is very clear.
But she didn't even think that was Rod's body.
Not only did Leigh not think, in fact even Rod himself was darkly surprised, though he had already noticed in the fight that the body was probably not calculated by the attributes of man, but did not think that he could be so disfigured, be so severely injured, be so fiercely fought, and be thrown to the ground in a fierce collision, and be able to act...
You're not supposed to be savage?
But there was one thing that Rod didn't say, that he knew his own body because he knew his own body, though he didn't know what it was, anyway, he was not a pure man.
But the golden girl's performance is very strange, in the sense that she is a delicate girl, and a non-combat professional spirit, generally dead in this case, able to live and run because of the physical attribute of non-human,
So why would she be able to live and jump?
It's never gonna be luck.
This question wasted until Rod saw the gold that was hidden in the beautiful blue eyes of Lizzy--and it seemed that it was not only luck that made her live.
"This is...
Mr.
Maes rubbed her hands, and a clear smile appeared on her fat face.
What do you think we should do next?
After rescuing Meas, the three separated and searched again for the remains of the float, but found no survivors. In order to avoid turning the bodies of their companions into the food of the beasts of the forest, Lizette proposed that they be cremated. Measasas as he was grieving for the precious goods of himself, he had to finally change his mind, looking at the shadowy face of the blonde girl and the indifference of Rhodes, with a painful, dying expression, looking at a fire that burned the float into ashes--
That's like he's the most serious.
Although thermal ornaments purchased at great cost ensured his little life, but because of the excessive impact damage, now completely broken into a piece of broken copper and iron, thus, the loss of Mercy is indeed not small.
After a day of rest in the forest, although there was no trouble, after the attack of the wind snake, the fat businessman had become the bird of the bow, before he had sworn that the wind snake was nothing but a small probability event, now he has completely changed his mind, the old small probability rumors in the present fat businessman seems to be absolutely accurate!
You see, they say that way is going to meet the swarms of winds and snakes, and we've met them! And I've also heard that there are evil wolves in the Milky Way forest, and dreadful strange birds, and they're not going to meet us either!
That's what's been bitten by a snake for ten years.
When he thought of all this, the fat merchant's forehead was full of sweat, though he was good as a merchant, but he had no experience of adventure, now looking at the bushes and trees around the forest, the fat merchant's belly trembled, once heard his guard speak of the poisonous snakes of the wild grass, of the evil wolves, and now so vividly floating in the fat merchant's mind that he had become a kind of grass soldier.
Add your only life support has become corrupt, in this case, fat merchants have no choice but to rely on others.
He didn't have any idea of Leigh, who had taken a look at the girl before she was hired, and it was evident from her eyes that the girl was a good listener, but she had no idea, and she was not a fighter,
I'm afraid I won't be able to help myself once something really happened.
As a result, eventually, Meas decided to rely on Rod.
Although he himself would not have fought, the previous performance of Rod was very awake, which indicated that he had sufficient power, although he did not know how far the young man's experience of adventure was from that of the mercenaries, he should not have gone any further.
As for Liz, she seems to be still in the pain of losing her companion, and does not care about this.
Don't worry,Mr.
Looking at the fat merchant's nervous expression, Rod shook his head, though the other was more rude, but he did not hate the fat merchant, after all he said, if the fat merchant had not ordered the ship to be stopped, he was afraid he would not have been saved, so Rod had a little good feeling for him.
"I'm very familiar with this silver forest and it's not very likely that there will be any particular danger in the area where we are now.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
In the Milky Way, the most threatening is the Milky Way Wolf, but unlike the Wind Snake, the Milky Way Wolf mostly acts alone, so it is better to deal with.
And now after killing the Snake leader, Rod has gained a total of 3,000 points of experience, up to eight.
The Newer Zone is a tenth level, so as long as it's not a rare class of monsters, Rod asks himself whether he can walk in the area, unless he and the New New Whites go blind on the map and then break into some dead monster nests--but this possibility is essentially zero for Rod, who's known as the "Walk Library."
Just like that.
Hearing Rod's answer, Meas wasted his mouth, and took out his handkerchief and wiped off the sweats on his forehead.
Then, inadvertently, he had hardly slept since that day, because of his high spirits, and the sound of the wind blowing through the woods was regarded by him as a whisper of wolf, which showed how tense he was, and now that he was determined, he was much more of a stick, so that the fat merchant had no more to worry about,
Rather,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When the fat merchant was sure he had fallen asleep, Rod, who had sat quietly by the fire, stood up, and then turned and went into the depths of the forest.
CHAPTER VIII X X X X X X
Rod certainly didn't mean throwing the fat merchant, on the contrary, the reason he left was just to check his own profits.
In previous battles, Rhode gained a great deal of experience, but did not gain a great deal of advantage.
Although for the player, before the crashed float all the treasure, and there are so many dead people, the wealth is sure to be a lot.
But in the end Rod wasted the idea, anyway, the other side is a blessing to himself, now others died themselves to search for the things on them, but some too say not passed.
Though experience is precious, for Rod, what he feels earned is something else.
That's what he's got right now, and it's a black stone.
According to the Dragon, it is the core of the soul that has the power of a living creature when it collapses.
Its characteristics are rich, that it can be used as a stone embedded in a weapon, or that it can be made into a soul weapon after melting, and that it is also a very good material for making magical tools for practitioners.
Additionally, souls have a low probability of falling, so that their prices in the world of Dragons are always high, and for summoning swords they have an irreplaceable role.
Because this is the precious thing to wake up the spirit.
And now, when Rod stood in the depths of the dense forest, he lifted up his right hand, and he saw the core of the soul, as if it were the size of a nucleus, spreading a thick darkness. And now he was lying quietly in his heart, and all around him was a quiet, gentle jungle, and at midnight the moon passed through the leaves, and was shining in the earth and the bushes as a spot of light.
Afterwards, the summon array on Rod's back again shines, and the flowing magic light also quickly extends.
Then there was a system in front of Rod.
[Do you find the heart of the polluted soul?]
Purification.
Suddenly, on the back of Rod's right hand, there appeared once again the brightness of the white, as if the water had flowed through the fingers, wrapping the core of the soul at the center of the hand.
With the penetration of the divine power, the black mist that had encircled the core of the soul was melting rapidly, like the white snow that shined in the sun, without any trace, and with the disappearance of the black mist, the core of the original encircled spirit finally showed its original appearance--transparent, shining blue, as if shivering like an egg-like stone, as if it had felt something, trying hard to break.
[The core of the spirit is purified, is it awakened?]
"Wake up."
Following Rod's words, the shimmering blue eggs trembled more and more intensely, and then, with the slight sound of a "clap," the whole eggs broke instantaneously, and then, the blue paths, like waters, burst out, and they whirled at speed, and then turned into card shapes, and finally lay quietly in Rod's hands.
A cool feeling came from Rod's body, making him tremble uncomfortably, and at that moment Rod had already learned what the contract with himself was.
He picked up a card, a blue half circle on the right (representing the card's own attributes), and a V on the left.
As for the two lower corners, there are two small numbers - 2.
Rod turned the card, and soon, on the back, appeared a way of shining magic.
Flying soul bird (wind element): The flying system can fuse spirits, with a 10% chance of triggering paralysis effect, penetration effect, and no magic protection.

Good luck.
Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord
But the saddest thing about Rod was his attributes, and now his attributes of strength, body, intelligence, will, and so on, are still in the hidden state, which makes Rod a little uncomfortable.
Although it was his own body, now the state of the body that was expressed completely exceeded the normal standard that Rod himself should have.
He's already determined his attributes must be more than human, but it's a bad feeling not to be able to know his physical condition in detail.
You thought you were going to die, but you didn't.
It's a beautiful mistake.
But if you don't think you're going to die, it's a deadly nightmare.
Since he can't see, he can only guess from his own experience.
Through the previous battle with the Lord of the Winds, Rhode also had roughly some ideas.
After all, as a BOSS data, he has also been studied in detail.
From the previous battle, his strength should be similar to that of a standard right-handed swordsman, and his body is quite strong, at least after coming to the world, despite having experienced several crises, but Rod's body seems to have been tested, representing the lowest of the physical conditions is alertness, never reaching an emergency level.
In terms of speed, there is little difference from normal human.
But when it comes to the will, Rod has no way of testing-he can't always find a therapist to throw himself into the psyche and then see what level he can resist.
Just then, there was a slight sound in the trees, and Rod picked up his eyebrows, put down his right hand, and the glow of the summoning force on his back changed in the instant, and the card he was holding turned into a little magic dust, and disappeared in the instant.
After being sealed as a card and having confirmed a relationship with the holder, the sealed cards will no longer appear in the form of entities, and they will quietly sleep in the ring called "Ten Sources" on the back of the summoning swordsman's hand, waiting for the holder to wake them up to use them.
At this moment, two cards were sealed in the bottom of the outer six rings of the "Kingdom" - the attribute of "star trace" and the attribute of "spirit bird" respectively.
Rhode did not intend to expose himself too much to others, although the game introduced summoning swords as a player's exclusive occupation, which existed in ancient times far off the mainland, and the players were the only legacy of the occupation, they embarked on a journey to find and re-establish the glory of the once heroic occupation --
Of course, this is a joke in the introduction to the game, but in a more practical way, through the expressions of Liz and Meas, Rod can determine that these people at least do not know the existence of such a profession, so he is not comfortable to say more.
Moreover, maintaining a certain sense of mystery, is not to the advantage of itself.
And just as Rod turned, only to see Lizzy had gone out of the forest.
"What are you looking for me?
"Oh.
No, nothing, Mr. Rod.
Lily shook her head, but her face was a little uncomfortable.
I just want to ask how is your wound, there is nothing I can do...
At last, the girl's voice was getting smaller, her hands clutched tightly under her robe, and at this time, she, to the man a very fragile feeling.
In fact, Rod also noticed Liz's unusual behavior.
Meas was able to see her character, because he was a merchant, always going south and north, without any eyes had been sold.
Rod is able to see her character because of his experience as the first president of the board of directors of Dragons, to know that unlike reality, players are hidden behind characters on the network, and this is why their performances are more hidden than in reality.
In this kind of online world, it is necessary to concentrate collective power, after all, most players come to the game to experience happiness, not to make it a job.
You have to get them on time, you have to get them out on time, you have to get them out on time, you have to get them out on time, you have to get them out on time, you have to get them out on time, you have to get them out on time, you have to get them out on time.
So, how to observe the emotions and the inner thoughts of the companions around you, for such a council president, is obviously quite important.
Now, Liz's performance is very clear, she lacks reliance, which makes the girl very very anxious.
Moreover, as Rod saw, the loss of a companion was a great blow to her, not only because the person she knew had left her, but also because of anxiety and fear for the future.
In the previous battle, Rod looked at the girl, and at that time she was doing all right, she was able to deliver healing spells to her companions in the shortest time, and she was able to quickly expel toxins from them, and finally she was able to calculate Rod's guard shield accurately to the second, a power that can be calculated to be quite excellent for an auxiliary profession.
And at that time she was confident, the goal was clear, though faced with danger, but not hesitant and timid.
But now this trembling little girl, has completely lost the confidence before.
Chapter 9
Looking at the girl, Rod sigh.
The one who should be worried about this is you haven't had a good rest since last night.
When she heard the word last night, her body shrinked, as if she had remembered it again.
Nevertheless, the girl still stubbornly bit her lips, and then shook her head.
No No No No No No No No No No
Leigh's words weren't finished, so that's when Rod raised his hand, and a heavy claw went on her face.
What is he doing?!
Covering her red cheeks, Li, with her eyes open, astonished as she could not believe, looked at Rod before her.
The young man stared quietly at her, then spoke.
"I can understand what you are thinking now.
When she heard this quiet, almost without emotional fluctuations, a burst of anger burst out from the depths of her heart, she laid down her hands, clasped her fists, as if she were trying to refute Rod's irresponsible remarks, but Rod's next word, however, gave her a total loss of the strength to do so.
Just because you're different from the others, that's not exactly right for an angel mixed with blood.
When she heard this, she was stunned, and her conscious crossed her arms, and stepped back two or three steps, until she stopped when she hit the big tree behind her.
Even so, Lizzy still doesn't care.
She stared at the man, opened her mouth, but couldn't say anything.
How could he know? No, it's impossible.
He hadn't told him, but there were people in the Corps who knew about it.
"How did you..."
"Your eyes."
Rod put out a finger.
"Your eyes reflect the golden glow under the light, which is the mark of the angel of the "guarder of light."
But unlike pure angels, your eyes are not shining, and that is what your human lineage conceals-isn't it?
The girl did not speak.
Though not answered, Rod has confirmed his idea is not wrong.
This girl standing in front of him is indeed an angel mixed, in fact he has been observing Lizzy for some time, as a top player, in a long game career, Rod is already familiar with the means to judge the other's attributes by means of equipment, features.
This not only allows the most appropriate tactics to be developed in the shortest time possible in the BOSS battle, but also allows for the development of first-person tactics in the PVP battle.
This can be said to be a skill that all experienced players will inevitably master.
In fact, after Rod and Liz were rescued, he began to consciously observe the girl, and soon realized the true identity of the other.
Although it is only a mixture of blood, the angel's powerful healing power and ability to resist damage has not disappeared, which is the main reason why Lily can survive after being thrown out of the float.
Liz herself must have been aware of this, so that would have been so depressing.
That's why I said I could understand your thoughts.
Rhode shrugged.
"You know why you can live, but it's not luck, it's the result of differences between you and others, and you can't accept that.
If possible, you even wish you were just an ordinary man, facing death like your companion, rather than living so cunningly.
Lizzy lowered her head and held her skirt tightly.
But that's not what you can decide.
Looking at the slightly shivering shoulder, Rod's tone was much slower.
"You can't decide where you come from, and you can't stop it," he said.
Don't ever regret something you can't do.
"So..."
Liz finally opened her mouth.
What should I do?
It's your way, you should choose.
When she heard that, she paused for a moment, then she lifted her head.
"I understand, thank you, Mr. Rod."
Don't be rude.
But it hurts that one of your palms...
Although there was some "violence" in the process, finally Leigh escaped from the shadow of loss of companions and self-righteousness, and when the sun rose the next day, the blonde girl's face had no previous sadness at all, instead of the usual gentle smile.
It was a bit of a surprise for one to fall asleep without knowing exactly what had happened. He looked at this, and looked at that, and finally there was a deep laugh at Rod.
As to what this means, no one knows.
However, the fat merchant had not come to satisfy his curiosity, the word of Rod immediately put him into the abyss.
"I think it's time to go.
Get out?
It made him think that he was now not in his comfortable room, but in this hopeless dangerous forest.
They weren't out on the outskirts, that damn wind snake, and that damn captain...
It doesn't make any sense to say that.
Most importantly how do they get out of this damn forest?
Thinking about it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since the young man said he had a way, he must have made a very detailed plan, after all, they were in this deep mountain, and it was not impossible to go astray, and there were so many beasts hiding inside
How to avoid their capture?
These are the necessary knowledge to live in the field, you must be careful and not be able to leak half a word,
If it is due to neglect to die here, then it is too irreplaceable.
With that was the thought,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let's go.
Wait, Mr. Rod!
The fat merchant almost jumped like a miso on a chair with an iron nail.
"Where are we going?
There's a small town in the northeast, and as soon as you get there, there's a lot more to go.
Isn't there something to be careful about?
It's not surprising that's what Rod would say, after all, as a newcomer to Dragon's Land, the Pafield area has already been dug up by the players, especially by the influence of online novels.
Early in the game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course, the reality is always cruel, although under the tireless efforts of the players, there are indeed found some very rare, attribute good equipment weapons, but unfortunately no one can achieve the player's "deity in hand, the world have" requirement.
After all, the standard is too high.
Though it was full of dangers and every step was likely to lead to death, for Rod, the area was familiar as if it were his back garden.
In the game, as the length of a session, Rod has no fewer than a group of newcomers to train here, so where are the more monsters, where are the fewer monsters, what task equipment is suitable for what profession, where are the attributes suitable for the most efficient training, etc
These things are natural for Rod, even if he throws them anywhere, he can go out with his eyes closed.
So there's naturally nothing special to remind him, and as for the Merchant's Protector's mission that Rod has done not a thousand and not a hundred times, how could he be mindful?
When he heard Rod's answer, a fat face washed away like a frosted egg, he had no idea of Rod's thoughts, but that was too uncomfortable, and when he thought about it, the fat merchant began to reflect on whether he had made the wrong choice, and thought about it, the young man had been seriously injured in the mountains, and if he hadn't been injured, it would have been so easy to say it.But now he had been injured, and if it had been so easy to say it...
Isn't it about death?
Even though there was some deep regret, there was no second way for Meas to ride under the tiger.
So helplessly, he only tightened his teeth, followed the two, and went to the depths of the forest.
Under the bright sun, the moon forest is very quiet, the sun through the leaves of the cracks, spreading spots of light on the ground.
The clear bird's sounded from time to time, and even the tracks of the rabbit could be seen in the grass. The sight was so peaceful that some of the already nervous fat merchants gradually relaxed.
It's not like before. It's anxious.
Rod was walking ahead, though it was not easy to walk through the woods without a way, but seeing his figure move through the woods with extraordinary flexibility, there was no way to stop him from doing so, either from the vines or from the stems of the plants with their hooks; he had been severely injured before it could be imagined, just looking at his back.
Immediately afterwards, Leigh was not slow, and it was evident that she had become accustomed to this kind of outdoor action and life, and though she wore an uncomfortable robe, Leigh was still steadily following Rod, occasionally sounding a warning to the merchants behind her to be careful of the road under her feet.
And the deeper into it, the deeper Lizzy's heart becomes surprised.
Although on the surface, Rod's direction is quite arbitrary, he does not choose a straight line, but occasionally bends to the left or to the right, and occasionally goes around a big circle, and if one looks at the surface, one only thinks that he is in a mess.
Few, however, noticed that, under Rod's guidance, in the forest, which was already full of obstacles, there appeared to them a flat road, as if it had been hidden in the forest, waiting for people to discover their common existence.
It's a very high skill, as Lee had heard the leader say, after all it's too difficult for ordinary people to find their way through the forest, and only the spirits who are in harmony with nature and the adventurers who are in the deep mountains on a regular basis can master it.
She'd seen her before.
At that time her team was lost in the forest, and sent to help their spirits did not follow the path already in the forest, but chose a completely opposite direction, at which time Lijee was very worried.
But eventually she got out of the woods quite smoothly, and that was the time when she learned the trick from her leader, but...
Looking at Rod's back, Lizzy looked at him with some suspicion.
According to the commander, such a skill can be mastered only by experienced spirits and adventurers. Ordinary spirits, though able to communicate with nature, have no way to achieve this step.
But the opposite is so easy, he never even stopped to communicate with the plants around, which means that he should not be a spirit, but.........
Even though Leigh had little to do with Leigh, she knew that Leigh's main weapon was the bow, but in contrast to Rod, who had never seen him since the beginning, Rod had never used a bow.
Who is he?
At this moment, in the depths of Lijee, more and more doubt.
Rod stopped.
Through the trees, he could clearly see the clear lake water, which was the center of the moon forest, the lake of moonlight.
In the game, this can be one of the camps for the players to rest in the middle.
That's great!
Looking at the clear water of the lake, Meas unconsciously licked some of the cracked lips, though it had not been too long since he had departed, it seemed as though it had been a few days for the businessman who had always been so respectful, to see such a good resting place in front of him, the fat businessman immediately stepped forward, planning to take a good rest by the lake.
But as soon as his body moved, Rod's hand pressed on the other's shoulder.
The fat merchant looked at the young man, but Rod didn't say anything, he just stretched out a finger, made a silent gesture, then pointed to the front.
The Fat Merchant looked at Rod's fingers with suspicion, and then his face suddenly turned pale.
Because just beneath the shadow of the lake, a white giant is lying there quietly, keeping an eye on God.
CHAPTER 10
As a businessman, of course, he could not have seen a wolf, but he could swear to God he had never seen a wolf of this size since he was born.
Just in terms of body, this big wolf is one foot tall, with thick fur shining, at this moment it is leisurely squinting, enjoying the warm sun after noon, the coarse tail is throwing away behind, looks very easy.
And at this very moment Li had her mouth shut, and she sat quietly behind Rod.
As a mercenary, of course, she knew how terrible and dangerous these beasts were, and though she had not been as nervous as the fat merchant to breathe, the girl, too, turned her eyes to Rod and waited for his order.
And Rod himself is thinking.
Silver Wolf Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna
Beasts are ordinary creatures, and giants are monsters whose character is fierce and dangerous because they have lived for a long time, or have been stimulated by something.
(And when they wake up to their soul power, they will be upgraded to beasts.)
By that time, they were not only fighting on their own bodies, but also more difficult.
Even though the immediate Silver Wolf hadn't reached the height of its predecessor in terms of threat level, it wasn't difficult for Rod to get rid of it, but...
With this in mind, Rod looked around unconsciously.
If it were a game, then Rod would have no problem with killing each other to get some experience to get some material, but now it's not a game, and there are only three of them, and Lizzie's just a ghost, and she doesn't have the ability to defend herself.
As for Meas, out of combat, in this case, more is better than less.
With this in mind, Rod made a gesture, then turned to the other direction, after all, the lake of moonlight was not small, and there was no need to make special efforts to get closer to the road.
Seeing his moves, Liz and Meas looked at each other, and then followed after Rod to leave.
But unfortunately, the good fortune does not seem to take care of them.
"I can't."
Just as the fat merchant turned, his feet slipped violently, then fell heavily on the ground, crushing a branch underneath him.
Just then, seeing only Rod, who had been walking in the front, immediately turned his head and raised his right hand, soon, accompanied by a crisp bird, the green figure from his hand fired out, directly to the rear of the two.
"Bow!"
A low screamed from behind them, accompanied by the sound of the collision, and when Leigh and Meas turned their heads, they were surprised to find that the only black wolf that should have been a distance from them did not know when it had come behind them, and at this moment it was lying on the ground, and seemed to have been struck by some force.
Then a shadow flashed from the sides of the two.
As soon as the fat businessman fell, Rod had no idea, after all, in the forest of the moon, the sensitivity and sense of these giants could be placed in the first three.
Fortunately, Rod has encountered more than one situation outside of the pig-like NPC in the game, and these experiences have had an effect at this moment--
Although Rod's sensitivity is not high enough to locate these giants, he has made a decision based on his familiarity with the giants, and although the resting Moon is unlikely to attack the others immediately, it is absolutely aware of the presence of the others, with the characteristics of these giants, it is more likely to remain silent afterwards, waiting for the dark to attack again.
They waited, but they could not wait.
It's not much better to get active and to control the situation.
Rod's judgment is very correct.
The Moon did not think the other would attack so quickly, faced the flying soul bird, it made a subconscious response, but still slowed a line.
The blue spirit bird struck its body, and the burning shock wave struck it off heavily.
Just as the black wolf lay on the ground and had not yet come back from the shock, the flashing rod had already come to its side.
He stared at the big wolf, then stretched out his right hand.
The green bird flies back into his hands, becoming a card, and its color is instantly turned green into white.
Rhode did not look at much, he turned his hand, grasped the card in his hand, and went straight to the moon soul's right hind leg.
The white beam struck the moon's right leg and nailed it to the ground, and at this moment the snow-white sword appeared in Rod's hand.
The Silver Wolf raised his eyes, staring dead at the evil man, while trying to stand up, but at the same time as it stood up, but inadvertently shaken, had to stand up again.
By this time, Rod's second shot had come.
After finishing the action of the Silver Wolf, Rod also darkly dropped his mind, after all, the greatest characteristic of these elites is speed, and if it is not possible to eliminate this characteristic of them at the first time, then the next must be a struggle.
Now that silver wolf wasted a hind leg had no way of fighting as fast as it had just done, so it was much easier.
Though one of his hind legs had been removed, the Silver Wolf was not so pathetic that he stared deadly at the sight of the target, and at the same time as Rod's sword came straight, he raised his fore claws, and waved heavily at Rod.
Although the Silver had a counterattack, but had anticipated its action, Rod did not panic before the claws in front of him, on the contrary, he turned his right hand, the white swordsman crossed under the claws of the the Silver Silver and brought with him a flower of blood.
And just as the silver wolf ate the pain and took hold of his claws, he saw only the sharp blade in front of him, which was even brighter than the sun.
Attack!
The break of the flying blade pierced its huge body, light and easy to tear apart the original hard fur, accompanied by the painful cry, the black wolf flew into the air, crashed on a small tree, and then fell again on the ground.
Its half body had been torn apart by a blurred wound of blood and flesh, and it was possible to see the Morsenic white bones inside and the slowly flowing organs inside.
It's awful, and even Rod, who was going to get the last shot, frowns. After all, the damage to be done in the game is shown only in the form of data, and it's not such a clear scene, although it's been seen before in the fight with the Wind Snake, but it's never good to see it.
Assaulted by a soul bird, combined with Rod's highly targeted assault, the Black Wolf had reached the critical point, where the original threatening cry had now turned into a subtle mourning, and it was struggling to support the body and try to stand up again.
But Rod didn't give it a chance, but he took his sword down, and stabbed the star into his brain, decisively taking away his life.
It seemed long, but in fact it was only a few minutes, and for Leigh and Meas, what they saw was the silver wolf being knocked to the ground, and then Rod appeared beside it, and in a few short swords it ended its life.
This surprised both of them to know that was a big wolf, it wasn't so easy to deal with.
She asked herself whether it would be difficult to kill a giant so easily, even with the help of her own company.
But if you look at Rod's performance, where is it like killing a wolf? It's easy and it's no different than killing a chicken!
As for the fat merchant's mood is even more complicated, knowing that just when he fell, the heart was already a cold, he of course knew what it meant, and feared that wolf would notice their existence, but he guessed the process, but did not guess the end, although the silver wolf did notice them, but had not yet come to act on his appetite, tragedy became a corpse..
Even though the danger had been lifted, the fat merchant was still in the middle of seven or eight, looking at the young man who was not far from him, and he knew it was his own fault, what to do if the other man turned his face and threw him here?
He wouldn't have to worry about these things if he hadn't changed his routine. After all, all the guards around him were people he had paid for, and he wouldn't have to worry about being told anything if he had made any mistakes.
But now different, this young man is not a guard and a mercenary, he and his own relations are completely equal, if he is not tired completely can throw himself here to care.
By that time I'm done with eggs!
"This is...
I.
I'm not...
Thinking about this, the fat man felt a cold sweat on his back, he licked the dry lips, intended to say something, but could not say anything.
Just then he saw Rod stand up again, then turned and looked at him calmly.
"Be careful how you walk.
Then the fat businessman found himself doing nothing but nodding.
CHAPTER XI CHAPTER XI
Rudd originally intended to rest near Lake Moon for a moment to continue on the road, but after encountering the giant he had to change his mind, considering the bloody taste of the corpse could lead to more unnecessary trouble, Rudd finally chose a flater high place as a lodging when he went under the sun.
After finishing dinner, Rod once again assumed the post of guard, although it was harder for his body, considering that only he was most familiar with the surroundings of the Milky Way Forest, and that only he was capable of fighting, it was also impossible.
Although the fat merchant Meas had the courage to help, looking at his fat body, Rod and Leigh, although not much to say, but their eyes have completely revealed the attitude of the two.
So the tear-the fat merchants had nothing to do but sit by the side and rubbish up what they had rescued from the wreckage of the floating ship.
Of course, Liz was not free, and at this moment, she was kneeling by Rod, putting her hands on his left shoulder.
"Aliy Mia"
Along with the girl's clear singing, a pale white light emerged from her hands, then slowly wrapped over Rod's body.
In theology, nearly 70% of the magic has been passed down in the form of the dragon, which has been widely used by humans since the creation of the universe.
As for the remaining parts are composed of angels, spirits, demons, and ghosts, as a race originally created and guarded by the ancestors of the giant, they also inherited the magical gifts and long life.
And this is the dividing line on the mainland, whether in the kingdom of the night (the kingdom of the dark night), or the kingdom of the light (the kingdom of the light) and the kingdom of the law (the kingdom of the judgment), whatever the political system they adopt, the highest of them will inevitably inherit the spirits of the five giant dragons, and the second is the non-human dominated by angels, spirits, devils and spirits, and the next is the human.
Of course, due to the different political systems, the class composition of each country is not very close.
As a kingdom, the night kingdom's class system is relatively strict, and there is no human being among its superiors.
In a light country where parliamentary democracy is implemented, half of the senior members of parliament belong to humanity.
And the angels, the spirits, and the number of human beings within the law of the upper classes, each occupying a third, are fairly balanced, and this is because the law of the state, which is governed by religious concentration, believes in the way of balance, and for them, balance is the perfect choice.
Rod has his hands on this continent, and he knows what is going to happen, which makes him a little worried.
After all, the player can not play, can take off the helmet turn and go.
But now differently, he has become part of this continent, so, in the face of the next disaster, what shall he do?
"Mr.
Mr.
"What is it?"
Their voice awakened Rod from his thought, and he lifted his head, and looked at the girl in front of him.
Afterwards, Leigh had returned to her normal appearance, although there were occasional worries between her eyebrows, it had been much better than before, the seemingly end-of-the-world, which never seemed strange to commit suicide.
"That's it.
Liz, shaking her head, looked carefully at her face, as if she had been bitten by a snake, and her face, as if she had been bitten by a snake, and her face, as if she had been bitten by a snake, and her face, as if she had been bitten by a snake, and her face, as if she had been bitten by a snake.
"I felt something in the fight with the wind snake before.
"Oh?"
Hearing this, Rod raised his eyebrow.
"What?"
I felt some darkness from the Lord of the Winds.
Here, said Li, biting her lip.
"But it's very thin, and it doesn't look like there's any creature with dark attributes..."
Mr. Rod,the wind snake, shouldn't be the dark creature.
Of course not, wind snake belongs to the wind element, and the existence of the dark element is eight bars will not hit far, but.....
Are you sure?
"Yes, I'm sure."
Hearing the girl's confident answer, Rod was inadvertently into a thought.
He knew, of course, what had happened during this period of history, when a series of attacks on freighters on the roads of the winds caused considerable losses, and when the Pathans were investigated, they claimed to have been directed and operated by the nomadic peoples who lived on the southern borders of the disputed area under the rule of the Pathans, and shortly thereafter, the Pathans sent troops to attack the area, and to expel and kill the inhabitants thereof.
In response to this move, the Night Kingdom quickly responded, not only dispatching troops to attack the Kingdom of Light's garrison, retrieving the land they claimed to be their own, but also as a guide, launching a comprehensive invasion of the Kingdom of Light.
This is a period during which Rod and other players were busy familiarizing themselves with new environments, new systems, and upgrades, and there was not too much depth to this part of the background.
By the end of the game's official opening, when players flooded in large numbers, the Kingdom of Light and the Kingdom of Night had begun a full-scale war.
As to what happened, the players had their say.
Some consider it a tragedy that the Light State attempted to recapture its territory without doing so, while others consider it to be an intentional provocation by the Night State to wage war in order to achieve its expansion.
Many more people think that is the night kingdom has been looking at the light kingdom tiger for a long time, this time the light kingdom itself handles the wrong leakage – of course, the player has no position, all depends on his own personal preference.
Rhode believed there was some reason for this: the southern borders are rich in crystals, which are an important resource for any country, and there is no reason for any country to give up.
The Dark Dragon of this generation is indeed a very powerful ruler, until the middle of the war, even a player known as a cunning and unreliable rogue can hardly gain anything in his hands.
Even once it was rumored that was not an NPC, but that members of the game company were playing the role.
As for the last saying, after all, in the wartime the performance of the Light Kingdom parliament, apart from the pig-like teammates, is completely unspeakable, many brainless orders attracted the players complained, to the end even appeared a lot of battalion players actively counter water to the Night Kingdom to fight the Light Kingdom, thus can see the tragedy of the situation at the time.
But now it seems that second party conspiracy is closer to reality.
There's nothing wrong with Li. As a creature with light elements, angels are very sensitive to dark elements. She's half-breeded and shouldn't have gone there either.
Thus, is the attack of the Snakes on the trade of the winds indeed a precursor to the night kingdom's attempt to launch a full attack on the light kingdom?
It doesn't seem to be easy.
Don't tell anyone about this.
All right, Mr. Rod.
When she heard Rod's answer, she nodded, took her hands back, and examined Rod's wound carefully.
"Your wounds are much better, and if this goes on, you will be healed in about fifty-six days.
"Thank you.
Rod thanked the girl a little, then he lowered his head, and looked at the system information that appeared before him.
Part of his health is beginning to return to green, and if this goes on, it doesn't take too long, and he can move freely.
Now, in front of Rod, there's a lot more to do.
What's the first thing to do?
Rod frowned and fell into a thought.
At the same time, at the place where the float crashed, two shadows were slowly coming out of the forest.
Is this the ship you said?
' said the man at the front, wearing a white, flowing, beautiful helmet, engraved on it by glittering gold lines, which, if Rod were here, would have recognized as the mark of the officer for the defense of the borders of the Light.
The man who stood behind him was wrapped in a black cloak, and his appearance could not be seen, and in the face of the man's inquiry he answered with only a small head.
They killed my messenger.
The dusty sounded back in the forest under the night curtain, giving one a cold and chewing cold feeling.
"It seems like your pet is incapable of getting rid of such a filthy and incompetent man.
It's not your fault!
The voice of the black man suddenly became much higher.
"If you can find me a superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior
Are you kidding?
The man hummed.
"What do you think of us? We are solely responsible for providing resources, and your business must be done by yourself, and what do you do if we are able to do anything well?"
said the man, paused, and then relaxed.
How long will it take you to start again?
It'll take at least half a month. Do you think it's easy to find one that can control the wind?
We'll double your pay for ten days.
Hearing the other's displeasure, the man's face sank, then he reached into his arms, took out a purse and threw it away.
Ten days later, I want you to start again.
The purse fell onto the ground, and a heavy sound of metallic collision, and the black bucket bend down, and extended a dry hand to open the purse, and then immediately joined.
All right, ten days, I'll keep to the agreement.
"I hope you understand that's not going to happen to any third person.
"Of course I know.
All right, look at the ship, there seem to be three or two rats running, can I help them?
No.
The man waved.
"I have my own way.
Hearing his answer, the black cloak laughed coldly.
Well, I'll see what you can do.
A thick shadow appeared flat, wrapped in a black cloth, and then disappeared.
Looking at the place where he disappeared, the man's face revealed a clear sense of disgust.
One day even the bones will turn into ashes!
After a cold hum, the man turned, sweeping the forest around his eyes with a thoughtful expression, then he pressed one hand on the sword handle, and put another hand in his mouth, blowing a loud whistle.
Soon a vulture circled down from the sky and landed on the ground.
At the same time, three shadows appear from the depths of the forest.
The man looked at them, then turned onto the vulture.
Go find the three rats and get rid of them.
Then he gave a cold order.
CHAPTER XII
The shadows through the woods, they separate from each other, and then meet again.
Did you find it?
There are remnants to the east, which are very likely to be the target, and from the point of view of time, should be no more than one day.
"They're going really fast," he said. "Continue, be careful," he said. "They're going really fast," he said. "They're going really fast.
"Yes!"
After the three dark talks, once again, a dark shadow disappeared in the depths of the jungle, their movements silent, not even the birds on the trees.
And it was after the darkness had gone, that the blue and green bird stood still on the branches and spread his wings and flew to the sky.
"Are you tracking?"
When he heard the bird of the soul, Rhode's face washed a little.
At this moment, on his shoulders, the half-transparent blue-green soul bird stood there quietly, shaking his head from time to time, extending his wings, appearing to be no different from the ordinary bird.
Only that translucent body and the elements that surround it show that the bird in front of us is not a living character.
Calling the Spirit Birds is a way that Rhode invented while on the way, and usually players are equipped with theft or guerrilla type of scouts when a team goes on a mountain adventure, to ensure that there is no danger in front of the road.
But now Rod apparently doesn't have such a good condition, so he had to retreat and seek a second use of his summoned creatures to find the way.
Fortunately, the birds of the soul not only dominate in terms of distance, but also add to the soul element biological holdings of the sense of the soul, can also make Rod more relieved.
Originally on an insurance basis, Rod wanted to see if they had any trouble after killing the 10th-class giant before the soul bird went on a tour behind them, but unintentionally encountered a bigger problem.
Though the perceived spirit could not present the concrete form of the objective, it could only judge by the weak light of the spirit, but Rod felt a little strange from the speed of the other, able to pass through the forest so quickly as to be roughly the kind of adventurer, detective--
After all, it's an unspeakable occupation.
In addition to the other's actions quite order, it is difficult to imagine an ordinary adventurer.
Was it a coincidence?
Or is it special for them?
Rod didn't dare, and if the other was bright, it'd be better to find the door.
But this kind of hiding in the dark is the hardest to deal with.
Plus Liz's previous reminder made him think it was a little strange, and it was hard to imagine what would happen if these guys were hostile to them.
However, when Rod saw her beside her, she was unable to open her eyes.
He's got an idea.
"Where do we go next, Mr. Rod?"
She handed the kettle to the fat man, who was sitting next to her, with a red face, and a sweat on his face, she asked.
Although Rod hasn't said much, on the way to take care of the fat businessman the work has always been done by Lizzy.
According to the girl herself, her own company had taken over the protection of the gentleman, so that even if she was alone, as long as the task was not completed, it must continue to be carried out.
Meas was naturally grateful for this, but I am afraid that he will not be able to live any longer, as he is now breathing like a cow.

The fat merchant, who had fallen down as soon as Rod had stopped, holding his bag like a baby in his hand, took out his handkerchief, wiped off the sweats on his face, and brightened an oiled face, even shining like a big bulb in the sunlight
"Holy, holy soul, I...
I haven't been going for years Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co
It took a long time to get back to God.
Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go
Take five minutes.
Rod looked at the sky, then calculated in the depths of the next course and time, and gave the order.
Hearing his words, the fat merchant who was sitting on the ground screamed at once, and then lay down.
And Li, with a soft breath, sat on the stone beside her.
Since then they have not encountered any special danger, with the soul bird to take the way, Rod very smoothly with them to avoid many dangerous areas, though as a result have lost some opportunity to get precious equipment, but Rod is not heartache, because in the world there can be no more than cow-haired players, and ordinary adventurers can not move on the mountains into the forest,
So it's not too late to take the two out of the mountain.
But...
Rod looked up at the near mountains, and stood up.
"Lizzy."
"Yes, sir, what do you say?"
"I'll go ahead and see if you'll take Mr. Maes up the mountain after five minutes of rest. "Go there, and in the shadow, you'll find a deserted mountain path.
You're waiting for me. I'll be there soon.
Liz lifted her head, and, following the direction of Rod's fingers, soon found the white stone on the side of the hill, and she turned to look at Rod with suspicion, not knowing how he knew it.
But the girl opened her mouth, but did not ask, and after these days of travel, she had understood that the man before her was a worthy man, though she did not know what he was going to do, but the girl nodded, and then looked at Rod and turned away.
Rod, of course, had his own intention; that stone was the entrance to the Sierra, once a glorious business route, where the northern ancestors, with their poverty and their life's power, had dug out a passage through the mountains, connecting the plains with the rest of the region.
It was once a glorious place.
But with the development and use of the winds, the sky without obstacles was obviously more secure than the forests of the crisis, so that the trade route was gradually abandoned, and those who depended on its survival had already left here, before looking for a better life, abandoned their homes, until here again became a wasteland.
The progress of civilization always make the once miracle of no sense, put in any world is the same.
But Rod did not come here to learn the philosophy of life.
He stopped, and at this moment, in the sight of Rod, appeared a desert.
And the body.
Morzon's white bones were almost covered with dust, and only rotten fur and corroded weapons were scattered around the ground, and this was a mercenary called the Tooth.
They were attacked by thieves on their adventure, and then two defeated and wounded died here.
Originally in the game, Rod needs to first receive a mission from the commission, then follow the clues to investigate their final commission, then follow the marks on the map, then find here, and finally take back the letters and treasures.
But after all, it's a game, and it's a necessary step.
Even so, many old men would not have done so complicated, they would have preferred to take the letters by hand, and the same would have been the case when they returned directly to the service.
This not only saves time but also makes it easier to save so many troublesome steps.
But Rod's not here to save those steps.
Going into the depths of the field, Rod saw at once a white bone lying on the side of the mountain wall, wearing an already corroded armor, and a black, rusty sword falling from his hand.
That's what Rod is the commander of the mercenary.
Going to the body, Rod looked at it first, then stretched out his hand, and soon drew out from the other's body a commissioner's badge-it was the letter of the tiger's commission, and it was the necessary thing to complete the commission.
Rod put it carefully in his pocket, then he looked down, and soon found his goal.
It's a dirty ring on a finger.
Rod carefully took off the ring, which, on the surface, had no use, and was no different from the scrap of copper and iron in the garbage.
But the immediate system suggests that's not the case.
[black iron ring,,,,,,,,,,,,,]
"Common."
Rod closed his eyes, grabbed his right ring, and drank in a low voice, then injected into his soul power.
The ring of his hand trembled a little, and the original weakness of his magic was clear, and when he opened his eyes again, it was not the copper and iron that was in his hand.
On the contrary, a black, carved ring, lay quietly on his heart.
[will command,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,]
Let's go.
Rhode put the ring on his right finger, which was the only way to relax his breath, then looked down for a moment, determined that there was no more valuable thing, then turned around, and returned to the hillside.
There, Rod could clearly see Lejee and Meas moving hard toward the white stone.
Obviously the fat merchant had no experience of climbing mountains, and he followed her with trembling, looking at him like this, presumably not because of the differences between men and women, for he was afraid of crying early to take her with him.
It's a waste.
Rod shook his head and was about to come together with them, and at that moment, the alarm from the soul bird suddenly sounded deep in his heart.
"-"
With astonishment, he looked in the direction of the forest, and soon he saw three shadows flying out of it.
It's awful!
CHAPTER 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 21 22 23 23 23 24 25 26 27 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 46 47 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 54 55 56 56 57 57 58 58 59 59 59 60 61 62 62 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 64 69 69 69 70 70 70 80 80 81 82 82 83 83 83 84 84 84 85 86 86 87 83 83 84 84 84 85 86 86 87 83 84 84 84 85 86 86 87 87 87 88 86 86 87 87 88 89 89 89 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90
There were no more traces of the three, for the two who were climbing halfway up the mountain were no more than obvious targets, and they looked at each other, and flew quickly toward the direction where they were.
But Rod's not slow.
His body glided from the side of the hill, accompanied by a loud whistle, and the soul bird, who had once danced in the sky, seemed to have received some command, and flew down.
Faced with the sudden attack of the soul bird, the three black men did not panic, they quickly set up the counter-attack, one waving forward with his swords, and the other two kept the direction, and continued to the direction of Lizzy and Meas.
Obviously, they have a clear division of labor, and they are very professional.
Don't stopping for this little entanglement, if the other is really just an ordinary bird, really can't stop them.
But it's a pity that's not an entity.
Faced with cold swords, the green bird had no intention of evading, but directly caught up.
A gleamed into the black man's eyes, but at the next moment his expression turned to fear-because the black man saw clearly that the blue and green bird had passed through the sword and had come straight to him!
Elementary!
Astonished in his heart, he hastened to turn his body, to avoid the attack of the other, but even so, the soul bird passed through his shoulder, the black man only felt that his half body had lost consciousness in the instant falling into the ice kiln, and had been trying to keep balance in half the air, and fell heavily, even the sword of his hand flew out.
Neither of the other two went well, neither of them cared when the soul bird passed by.
But soon a cold wind followed, blowing through their bodies.
Both felt their bodies instantly become stiff, and had to stop.
Although the strangeness soon dissipated, because of the delay of the few seconds, Lizzy and Meas had already reached the place of the white stone.
When he saw it, the black man in the forehead frowned, he made a gesture, and then took the shortbow from his waist.
Hair, what's happened?
The paralyzed fat merchant, who had climbed to half the way, came to the side of the white stone, with his hand on the side of the stone, breathing with a great mouth, but before he had to complain again, a few dark shadows came from the side of the fat merchant, and shot at the side of the stone.
"Wow!"
Meas scrambled down with his head, and Lejee with her unconscious body shrinking, while she also remembered to take the fat merchant by the hand, pushing him into the shadow, to avoid another attack.
"We must be faster.
Just then, Rod, who followed, looked up at the three dark shadows not far from the mountain, and said.
"He, who are they! What has happened! Why are they attacking us?"
Probably the detective.
It was not too far, but because of the good weather, it made it possible for Rod to see what they were wearing, which were the standard suits of the spies, most of whom were the same in size as those who were under the guardianship of the Light Dragon, as to which country they came from, only after they had been killed.
However, Rod does not have this ability, and even the special ability of the spirit bird can only freeze them for seconds, and it is not because these people are too resistant to attacking the spirit elements, but because their own level is too low, that they cannot achieve better attacking effects.
It's worth it.
As to why attack us, I think you can ask yourself, whether they will be in a good mood before you die.
Though it was difficult for Rod to make a joke, the fat businessman could not make a joke, and as a businessman for many years, he of course knew that the spies were not the most attractive.
What would happen if it fell into their hands, the fat merchant, when he remembered the unpleasant rumors circulating among his companions, was pale and sweaty.So, though his tired thighs trembled, he stood up and followed Rod to the little road that was covered by white stones.
Thermal Road was once a very bright business road, wide enough to accommodate two carriages in a row.
But now it has been completely abandoned, and all kinds of rocks falling from both sides of the cliffs are piled up in the roads, which have turned the broad road into a rugged, and extremely narrow.
The three fell and fell forward, but did not dare to stop.
Rod turned to look, but the situation had not improved-the footsteps behind had become clearer and clearer, and had it not been for the constraints of the terrain here, I would have feared that he and others had already been surrounded.
"Mr. Rod! There is no way!"
Lejee's alarmed Rod, and indeed, the nearby road was completely blocked by rolls, and could not be crossed or penetrated.
That's what it is.
Rudd shook his head, thinking it was to force the player to the system's set course, but now it seems like it's not the same thing-
It's not what it's supposed to be.
Go to the right.
On the Right?
When they heard Rod's orders, they both stared at the little road to the right, but they did not hesitate for any more than a few minutes.
Even though the main road was blocked, there was a small road nearby, most strangely, it was clear, but there was a thick fog in that road, the sun through thick fog, which brought a strange atmosphere.
Looking at it makes you think there's something weird about it, and now Rod wants them to go in there?
Come on, come on.
However, under Rod's impulse, the two quickly entered the mist, soon, their figure was completely shielded from the thick fog, no trace.
When he saw the two entered, Rhode also relaxed, he looked back again, then stretched out his right hand.
"Cage!"
The card in the center of the hand turned blue, then the snow-white sword blade appeared again, after which Rod tightened the long sword, swung violently to the cliff.
The sharp blade of snow flew out of the sword, and struck the rocks above the cliffs, and soon, under the great noise, the broken rocks rolled down with the dust.
As the three black men pursued, Rod's figure had already disappeared from the depths of the fog, under the cover of smoke and stone.
"I'm dying!"
Looking at the trail of wolves, a black man bit his teeth complained.
The road ahead has been completely blocked by crushed stones.
Needless to say Rod's sword triggered a chain reaction, now that the cliffs on both sides of the road were shaking, it was more dangerous to go further.
What do you do?
There is no way.
Another black man stared deadly at the already closed mountain path.They only reported back to the captain and sent men to watch all the villages around them, and they were sure they wanted to get away from behind, but they didn't think of it.
"Elementary creatures, are there any wizards among them?"
"If they are, it is not surprising, but it seems to us that there are not any.
Just as the two black men exchanged views, the other one remained silent, looking at the marks on the mountain wall opened.
There is a very strong swordsman among them.
With that said, the black man turned his head.
"Let's go, these three goals are not easy, but we are not losing," he said. "Let's go and immediately monitor the surrounding villages, and I believe they can't stay in the mountains until they come out."
For Rod and others, the danger has not been lifted.
"Where is this?
The fat merchant stared at all, and he thought he had seen all the things he had been walking south and north for so many years, but the encounters of these days told him that there were more things in the world than he knew.
After passing through the thick fog, it appeared before all, a deserted, abandoned town, the whole town wrapped in thick fog, almost everything looked fuzzy.
Even if you look up at the sky, you can only see a gray piece.
The whole world seemed to be completely different.
It's awful.
Rod, who came from behind, answered.
"Just through here, we can get to the mountains of Alaska, and then we can leave."
But is there any danger here?
If you're not blind, nobody thinks this place is peaceful.
There is, of course.
Rod didn't make it clear that was the first copy of the game, and the first copy of the player, that it wasn't difficult to say, but it wasn't easy to say.
But it's awkward for the three in this line, after all Rod is only 8, and Lizzie is only 6, and the merchants with only 5 fighting powers aren't even counted, so it ends up that this is actually an 8 level summon swordsman and an auxiliary professional single brush 10 5 - put in the game will surely be regarded as a fool.
Rod wasn't a fool; in fact, he'd seen Liz before he'd thought about this venture, otherwise Rod wouldn't have chosen this path-
In fact, this road is now the safest, by comparison with the risk.
But as long as you obey my orders, there will be no great risk.
So..."
said he, turning his head, and looking at the blonde girl.
"I'll see you here, Liz."
CHAPTER 14 Theft of Two
Me?
When she heard Rod's words, she opened her eyes, and even her neighbor, Meas, opened her mouth.
As is well known, therapists, doctors, and nurses are the most common occupations of the therapists in the Dragon's Land. They are essentially auxiliary occupations within the team, wrapping wounds for others, healing wounds, releasing protective shields and removing toxins.
What about fighting on the front?
I'm afraid you've never heard of this!
"Yes," he said.
Rod nodded, and in the moment of coming here, he seemed to be again in the command of the team's brush.
"In a moment you will listen to my orders, which do not require any special skill, but your reaction and consciousness will be somewhat higher, but as long as you are familiar, I don't think it will be too difficult.
What do you know about energy now?
How many times can the Divine Light be used?
Despite her previous healing, Rhode roughly guessed her level, but at the risk, it was confirmed.
"I'm a regular spirit, and I'm on the seventh floor of the outer ring.
As for the sacred glory.
Only once a day can be maintained...if my soul power is not consumed.
In addition to the professional level, they also have the level of the soul power, respectively the outer ring, the middle ring, the inner ring, the outer ring ten layers, the middle ring seven layers, and the inner ring three layers.
This is because the practitioner believes that their powers come from the depths of their own souls, and in the common sense, the souls are regarded by the practitioner as three intertwined rings of existences, the deeper the practitioner explores his own soul, the stronger.
Liz's powers have reached the seventh sphere, which means that she is very likely to break the limits of the sphere's healers and enter the middle sphere.
It's hard for a six.
But then Rod would be more sure.
"Well, remember, from now on, you don't need to give me a healing light, even if I'm injured," he said. "Be careful, Mr. Maes, and give him a shield if there's any danger.
"This..."
I understand, Mr. Rod.
Although Rod had some words in her mouth that made her feel strange, she understood the other person's meaning even though she had guessed it, and she glanced at it.
"Mr. Meas, is our supplement still enough for a few days?"
It's still three four days.
With his travel bag, the fat merchant thought a thought, then answered, but with a little sadness on his face.
"If we save some food..."
It's a good time to lose weight.
If Rhode had a laugh, then Meas could have taken it as a joke. Unfortunately, Rhode's expression was very calm, without any laughter, which instead made the fat merchant more bound up.
While he wasting to say anything more, Rod had turned his head and ordered Leigh.
"Give me the glory."
"Yes," he said.
Faced with Rhode's orders, she lowered her head a little, then she stretched out her hands and closed her eyes.
Soon there was a gentle light from the middle of the girl's heart, a gentle white light spreading round and around, and I didn't know if it was a mistake, but the fat merchant found that the thick fog around him, which had been shining to this light, began to flee away quickly, and after rubbing his eyes, he found that the surroundings, which had been covered by thick fog, were now much clearer.
Some ruins could only see a vague shadow, but now they can clearly see the remains of walls and houses.
This makes everybody uncomfortable, after all, the view is clear that some are always more safe.
"I'll go first," Lejee, "Mr. Meas," "You'll come to the end," "Don't go too far from us," "No matter what happens, don't act alone."
There was silence in the ruins.
Brightness filled with positive energy dissipated the mist, but did not dissipate the danger inherent in it.
They moved slowly under Rod's guidance, stopped to watch around, and then moved on—but soon Rod moved his hands again, indicating that the two were stopping.
If his memory is correct, he is almost at the first wave of strange new.
It was unexpected that shortly after Rod stopped, a few faint spots appeared in the mist ahead, and they seemed to flash like eyes.
"Well, what is that?
Meas immediately became nervous.
It's a ghost.
Rod stretched out his right hand, and soon the mark appeared in his hand.
"Be careful, they won't get too close."
As soon as Rod's voice came down, the crowd saw the thick fog rise and fall, and then spit out three strange creatures.
They looked like humans, but all around them were packed with thick mist, three monsters standing together, invisible, even some not seeing their bounds, and only the three bright little eyes could confirm that this was not just a simple mist.
Perhaps not so easy.
"Lizzy," "the first light of healing."
Healing Light?
When she heard the command, there was a doubt in the girl's mind, that it was a healing technique, why should it be applied to this monster? But that doubt was only a glimmer in Leigh's mind, and soon Leigh lifted her right hand, and she applied healing light to the monster before her.
As a magician, Li's technology is still very good.
Healing Light is a medium healing technique, as long as it is possible to determine the location of the target, then it is not difficult to spread.
It's easy for Liz, but maybe because the other is not a companion, but a monster, makes the girl's movements a bit hesitant, but she still quickly completed the magic.
A white light instantly appeared from the air, then wrapped on the ghost.
According to the original effect, the life wrapped it will immediately restore a certain degree of injury, even can be revived, belongs to the foundation of the magic used by the spirits.
But the ghost's performance was completely different from the girl's, and as it was covered with that white glow, the ghost made a scream that she could hear clearly, and then his body, which had stood before, kept shaking as if it had been beaten with a heavy punch, and as if it had been wrapped in the mist, and even as if it had been dissolved in that moment, as if it had been melted by the sun.
This surprised Lizzy, and she even lowered her head to look at her hands, and couldn't understand how she could release a magic that was so deadly.
After seeing the ghost's performance, Rod was very vague, knowing that the positive energy generated by healing light was originally a ghost's negative energy set, not to mention that half of Li Ji's lineage was an angel's lineage, that the positive energy of the angel's lineage and the natural one of ordinary man's lineage differed in quality, that if the latter's released positive energy was boiling water for the ghost, then the former's accumulated positive energy would not be inferior to a high concentration of sulfuric acid, and fortunately Li Ji's was a mixture,
If she were a pure angel, then the ghost would have been extinct.
Liz does not understand why a healing spell can have such an effect, but in fact the players on the Dragon is basically clear, in their view, that the healing light is just wearing a mask, the essence of the spell is to put a positive energy. Just the positive energy brings healing effect when encountering life, to make it easier to see, does not mean that it can only heale wounds.
At the beginning of the Dragon Conquest, there was a joke among the players: The most tragic thing for a ghost magician is to meet a group of ghosts—because ghost magicians are essentially from negative energy, and use them to attack non-living creatures that are equally composed of negative energy will only have the effect of healing rather than destroying.
And that's why some of the ghost magicians who once had the fantasy of controlling the Death Army have to tear their eyes to learn some elemental magic to make sure they have the advantage over the non-death monsters -- yes, they sometimes have to be part-time nurses.
In essence, there is no great difference between the deceased and the spirit, and most of them live in a group environment where their abilities cannot harm them, and only when they encounter the opposite attributes can they have an effect.
It's just that's a relatively high chance of encountering life.
For the ghosts, it was not until the darkness came to the midst of the war, when the ghosts were raging, that they got rid of the garments of the logistics, and became a strongman in the front.
Until then, the ghosts are less likely to encounter the ghosts, plus the NPC after all doesn't know as much as the players, so it's not strange to stick to the rules.
But it's not the time to stick to the rules.
Two after the attack!
Rhode screamed to the ghost in front of him, while giving orders to Li.
"Yes!"
Perhaps inspired by the vision, the answer was also very spiritual, and soon, two more full rays of positive energy descended from the sky, falling on the other two ghosts, respectively.
The gentle light washed over them and stopped them from attempting to attack. And on this occasion, the shining Rod had already come before the first ghost.
The ghosts, brushed with right energy, screamed, and Rod was the target of their anger.
Soon, the ghost in front of him, stretched out his semi-transparent claws, and caught Rod with a call.
Although Li'e's power weakened their defenses, their attack power increased considerably, and if they were to take care of it, they were likely to sink into the ditch.
But for Rod of course would not allow such a thing to happen.
He made a mistake, and was able to avoid the long claws of the ghost, and then the sharp blade of his clean white sword struck straight forward.
Attack!
The Stars accurately hit the only semi-entity of the ghost's phantom body, which made the ghost, suffering under the brightness of the right energy, send out a cry, it desperately raised its claws, and then the body that was already on the brink of collapse completely disappeared into a pile of dust dissipated.
Just then, two more ghosts attacked.
Chapter 15
"Call..."
Looking at the dust, Rod wiped the sweat on his forehead, felt a bit tired.
All the way, the three encountered ghosts many, foot-five six.
It's not much if you put it in a team of five people, but now Rod has only one force, and there's no way of getting a MT up against it like a normal brush, and then everybody's out there.
Instead, he is able to attract each other with care, and then to release the right energy to weaken the defense of the other, then to shoot at the fastest speed.
Since the ghosts are at least ten-level elite monsters, even the weakened defenses of the immortals are equally difficult to deal with, and in order to pursue the maximum damage, Rod uses the attributes of the hand marks, and only tries to get the maximum damage from each sword to hit the enemy.
But man is not a machine, even in a game, such a demanding attack will consume a lot of energy, not to mention the body that Rod is using right now, in a game that fails can be repeated,
But if it fails here, then it is very likely that it will face death.
This pressure made Rod unable to even endure, and he lifted his head and looked at the ruins that were covered in the mist before him, and it was when he was certain that there would be no more monsters for a moment.
"Mr. Rod, would you like to take a break?"
Immediately afterwards, the girl looked at Rod, who, as a spirit, was not very aware of the meaning of Rod's every move, but was able to feel his current pressure.
"No... now..."
Rhode shook his head, though the little wonders had been cleared, but he had always felt a little danger, and he looked around with caution, but he could not understand where the little sense of crisis had come from, and from a distance they had not yet reached the BOSS plate, and should not have encountered too much danger, and Rhode was well acquainted with the non-living organisms here, and the monsters here should have been reasonably cleaned.
So where does this sense of danger come from?
Rod looked around again, but he didn't get anything, and at this moment the fat merchant next to him suddenly shouted.
"Oh!"
What happened?
Rod and Leigh turned their heads in a hurry, only to see a pale face, a hand tied to the travel bag, a slight shaking finger to the thick fog behind.
Just now there was a darkness...
"The Dark?"
Liz looked in the direction of her finger, but nothing in the thin fog except the light sun.
"No," he said.
"Lay down!"
And now, when Rod's mind was bright, he finally understood where the danger came from.
Then he shouted, and pressed on the girl's head, and forced her down.
"Come!"
Almost at the same time, a shadow flew from the air, and Rod could almost feel the cold claws brushed over his head, and even some stiff, stiff pain.
You're fucking dead!
At this moment, Rod's heart was sinking into the valley, and he knew what this dangerous premonition was!
It's a stone ghost!
Thermal Ruins once were a lively and bright town, but with the end of the business street gradually abandoned.
Then a magician came to save his beloved, and chose to study the law of death in this abandoned town.
However, the study failed and the philosopher died as a result.
But that method of death did not stop, and it produced a thick mist and so many immortals.
And the highest level of danger in the whole copy is the stone ghost that the magician left to guard his remains, that is the rare elite of the fifteenth level!
Rod would have been quite happy if he had replaced the team in the game.
Because rare elite are rare, sometimes the next few copies will not be able to kill one.
But now he feels cold in his heart, the other is a rare elite of fifteen, even flying monster.
There is also a considerable difference between those ghosts that do not rely on negative energy, and at least the positive energy of Lizzy can do nothing for it.
Additionally, the body made of black stone is exceptionally hard, and the damage that ordinary attack can cause is very limited, it can be predicted that this is absolutely a struggle!
In the game Rod down thirty times fog was not seen a stone ghost, so he subconsciously forgot this, but didn't expect to meet after coming here for the first time?
Is This Good Luck?
But now Rod is not in the mood to correct the problem because the danger is near.
There is no future in front battle, after all you are less than ten, challenging fifteen-level monsters is almost impossible to accomplish, even with the addition of stars, and the attack power is really limited.
Come on!
Without hesitation, Rod immediately gave the order, and with one hand he lifted her, and shouted.
Come with me, lower your head, don't look up!
Now to retreat is not possible, the only way is to find the center of the stone ghost's control and to destroy it completely, though to escape its range of attack is one of the choices, but look at his team configuration, and there really is no one who can easily pull the other out--if there were a giant or a thief.
But it's not the time to complain.
Led by Rod, Lejee and Mees lowered their heads and began to move forward, and the mist around them again began to rise, and it was evident that their movements attracted the attention of the ghosts, and already four or five ghosts had drilled out of the mist and began to move in the direction of the three.
"Lie, attack! Don't stop!"
"Yes!"
Although it was not easy for a girl to practise magic in the run, she had her right hand stretched out by biting her teeth, and soon, three or four lines of white light appeared from the sky, and fell on the ghost.
Then Rod struck, accompanied by a scream, soon the obstructors of the way disappeared into dust.
At this moment, Rod's eyes immediately flashed a system.
[Experience Points 1900]
But Rod had no time to care about the system's suggestion, so now more and more ghosts appear from all around, although their actions were somewhat hesitant and delayed under the illumination of the sacred light, but the advantage of quantity did make up for the gap.
Compared to the inflexible ghosts, the stone ghosts do not care about the sacred glory.
Although a product driven by negative energy, as a guardian of the wizards, the hardened appearance of the black shining stone made by the ghost is sufficient to resist the invasion of most sacred powers.
And after the first hit, it instantly recognized that the people were its target, and followed closely behind the three, awaiting the moment of launching the attack-it was indeed more difficult for a man-made organism to have some fighting intelligence than for an inanimate creature to be able to attack by instinct.
"Oh!"
Meas fell to the ground.
The stone ghost, who had been behind the people for a long time, flew down immediately, and two sharp claws struck the fat merchant who fell to the ground.
As Maes turned, what he saw was almost a shadow over his body.
"Oh, my God!"
Although the stone was fast, and Meas was well prepared to close his eyes and wait for death, his attack was not successful-a pale, shining golden screen appeared in the sky, blocking the sharp claws of the stonestone, and then a few snowy blades of light flew from the sky, hitting the stonestonestone upon it heavily, accompanied by a loud "clap," the unable stonestonestone fell out and heavily smashed into the ghosts.
And at this moment, Leigh, who had been halfway to the world, began to lie to the warm merchant, and to run forward.
Here!
Under the siege of the ghosts, it was not easy for Rod to get rid of most of the immortals, and then he lifted his head, and soon found his goal-that was an abandoned church, and that was the place where the witch used to test himself, and that, according to Rod's memory, the center of the stone-like ghost should be there.
But this is not a good place to go.
Just as Rod came to the door of the church, he felt a darkness in front of him, and he hastened to the rear, and then saw a dark stone like a ghost half-squated where he had just stood, and a hard claw had hit the ground heavily, crushing the original hard blue brick.
It's a life.
Rhode screamed, and as he flew away, he found that the stone statues that were used to decorate the church's doors on both sides were flying without wings.
And you can think about where they've gone.
Once I met two, it looks like I should have made some money today to buy the lottery.
Go inside and find the central control!
Rod looked at the stone ghost before he gave the orders to Lizzy and to Meas.
"These ghosts shouldn't go in for your trouble," I said. "I'll get these two guys," I said. "You'll go in right now, find the central control, then destroy it, and be careful of the trap."
"But...
You, Mr.
It's an order.
Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord
Go!
CHAPTER 16
The shadow of black crossed in the air, the storm emitted bright fire.
"Wow!"
Rhode retreated quickly, his pure white sword shaking unbearably, and a great shock came from his sword, shaking his upper half with some hidden pain.
As in Rod's memory, fifteen-stone ghosts really don't do well, especially two.
The only advantage is that these guys really have a bit of fighting intelligence, which wouldn't be a good thing to have on weekdays, but now the extra artificial intelligence makes their actions less threatening.
Especially the stone ghost who had a hard time eating a broken blade now screamed back as soon as he saw the white light shining on Rod's sword, and the other, though not hit, was hesitant to see his companion's action, which gave Rod a chance to breathe.
But it's only temporary.
Hold the stars, looking at the two stone like ghosts hanging in the sky, Rod bite the tooth.
Although the two stone ghosts weren't afraid to attack again because of their broken blades, Rod was also sure that they wouldn't have let themselves down so easily.
Although both sides are still able to - stand still, the situation will not last for too long.
When he was upgraded to 8, Rhode had his skill D upgraded to 4, although after the upgrade, the soul power consumed by the broken blade had been reduced somewhat, but if used frequently, there would have been problems.
Moreover, this was not the last battle, and Rod had to reserve some of his power to deal with the next possibly sudden event.
After all, he is the only one of the three who has the power to fight, and if all the power is consumed here, it will be very trouble.
Neither of the stone ghosts stared at Rod. Instead, they came back and attacked Rod with their claws extended, and left immediately when they found that he had a counter-attack.
This wheeled battle is quite demanding for strength, but it is not an obstacle for the two fully powered man-made alloys.
But it's different for Rod.
The sweat dropped slowly from Rod's forehead, his body becoming more and more exhausted in the last defence.
But Rod couldn't step back, knowing that with his present abilities it was virtually impossible to single out two stone ghosts, so he had only hope in Lizzy, after all there was nothing special to be guarded against in the church, but...
I seem to have forgotten to remind them of the protective force?
But after a thought, Rod shrugged his shoulders, and concentrated again on the stone-like ghost in sight.
You can't die anyway.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Meas fell to the ground, the whole man twitched.
"I'm going to die!
Oh! Oh!
Help!
It's just electricity! You're not dead, Mr. Meas.
While searching for the dust and spider webs covered the worn-out tables of the invisible that had been eroded by time, Lejee, who had never returned, handed a healing to Maes to heal his wounds, and then went into the search again.
Although ordinary priests use many protective techniques in their own rooms to protect their secrets, the church is after all "years of neglect", and with the passage of time, the strength of the protective faction is weakened by 78 per cent, and there is no particular threat.
As a semi-angel, Li's anti-magic powers are not too weak, so these have been weakened power defenses do not play much role for her, the traps that would have burst out fire and lightning at the time of the touch are in her hands only a few faint magic lights disappear.
It was the tragic Mr. Meas who, after all, as an ordinary man, had no resistance, which is why his performance made the defenses more or less threatened.
"Oh, this place is really disgusting... "
Meas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Within the darkness of the church, only the sacred light that was given to her quietly hanged by her, illuminating the world that was once dark.
But these scenes made Maes look frightened, and under that bright light he could clearly see the dark, strange, French, and the white bones of森 on the floor.
These were enough to soften her legs, not to mention the blood marks on the walls, and the frightened maid almost pulled her legs out at the moment she came in.
Had it not been for Lejee's very calm behaviour that made him very unable to face, and given the two more real dangers outside the door, I was afraid that the fat merchant had already escaped.
But now, he had to stick to his head and go with Leigh to look for the "control center" that he didn't know anything about.
It's such a mess. How can we find that strange thing?
Meas whispered, but looking at the serious look, he had nothing more to say, and continued to look for.
And now Rod is not easy either.
The Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone
On the contrary, it turns, its coarse tail drops instantly!
Oh, shit!
Hearing the wind from behind, Rod was deep.
He turned hastily, and his long sword was immediately sealed before him.
Rod's reaction wasn't quick, but the attack wasn't slow either; he had just turned around, felt a huge impact pass through his sword, a powerful force that didn't just bend the white sword in Rod's hand, but shot him straight out, and stopped after a few laps of rolling on the ground.
"Wow!"
Rhode climbed up, and felt his head flared, his blood flared, and even half his body wasted, and he was afraid to throw away even his sword.
He was still trying to shake his head and regain his senses, but a small voice from behind made Rod nervous at once.
?
With that sounded like nothing, a cold breath came from behind Rod, and Rod thought nothing, and instinctively rolled, to avoid the attack of the other, and when he lifted his head, he found three ghosts slowly approaching him.
The stone-though the moment did not cause any damage to Rhode, it drove him from the church door to the edge of the boundary.
The ghosts had no way of approaching the church, though they did not disperse, but wandered around the invisible barrier, relying on their own instincts to wait for the opportunity.
And now the opportunity has come.
Rod, of course, did not intend to have all these ghosts, and in the face of the enemy, he had to bite his teeth, to give up the idea of preserving power, and the sword suddenly emitted a white light, flying forward.
A white blade came out of Rod's sword, and as it rolled away, it hit one of the ghosts heavily, ripping off his protection, and Rod did not hesitate to fly straight ahead, and his long sword drew a perfect arc in the air, and pierced the ghost's body core.
Just as the unfortunate ghost cried out to be dust, Rod had passed through its body and returned to the boundary protection.
What to do next?
Just as Rod thought about this, a line of system presented to him, but he was surprised.
[4000/1800,,,,,,]
You're already in grade 10, but you're only in grade 8 before you get into the mess.
Rod paused, then, to remember that he did seem to have swept through a system that had been sufficiently upgraded by experience, except that at that time he had encountered a stone-like attack, so he did not care.
And now it seems that experience of the ghosts he killed on his way is enough to raise himself to the next level.
It's not surprising, after all, it's a five-man copy, and almost all of the monster's experience is from one of Rod's, plus his level is already low, and the more he kills, the more rewards are added, so it's normal to get to ten--
Perhaps the only strange thing is that we live in the real world, but that there is an experience.
But now that doesn't matter, Rod quickly opens his attributes, and then makes a choice, knowing that this is probably his only chance of gaining an advantage.
[4000/1800,,,,,,]
[Experience Point 2 2000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,]
[Experience Point 200]
[Do you open the gift system?]
Open!
Without hesitation, Rod responded quickly, and in less than a second, three sets of different gift trees appeared before him.
In Dragon, each occupation after the tenth grade has three gift choices, they can choose one of them as their main, or they can choose the attributes and skills attached to other gifts to assist.
This attribute is also obtained by skill points.
This makes the player confused at first.
Because a person can get only one skill point per level, not to say the gift tree, including the skill of swords, magic, and so on requires a lot of skill points.
This also makes the skill points that the player can initially allocate fairly limited.
Fortunately, once players have entered the medium, they can use a "wake up scroll" and complete some difficult tasks to gain additional skill points to upgrade their skills.
Rod's summon swords also have three different talent routes: the summon master, the spirit messenger, and the hell lord.
Each level increases the number of spirits summoned by the holder.
And the "spirit" follows the path of strengthening the summon of spirit power.
As for the special powers possessed by the "Lord of Hell", the holder, after killing non-human creatures, has a certain probability of converting them to his own summoned spirits, of course, limited to the non-death attribute after conversion.
It can be said that the three talents are superior and inferior, that the summon master is dependent on the quantity to win, and that the spirit envoy is focused on the quality, but given the rarity of the devils and the expensive price of the core of the soul, that the master of hell is also a very good choice.
I'm afraid you'll have to hesitate to give up all of them, but for Rod it's not a problem, after all he's been in the sword-for seven years now, and all the knowledge and skills he's learned about the sword have long been regarded by a large number of players as a classic.
Even in the game, almost two-thirds of the players who choose to summon the Swordsman are based on the skills of Rod to create their own characters.
So, this is difficult for many new players, as soon as Rod saw the gift tree already decided the answer.

[ [ ]
Just as the last line of system text disappeared, Rod's eye corner flashed over a huge shadow.
But he did not retreat, nor was he afraid.
Rather, Rod raised his long sword and waved forward.
"Wow!"
A green figure flew out of the sword's flank, striking at the flying stone-like ghost.
The Bird of Soul.
Rod's biggest problem is he can't summon two summons simultaneously, and unfortunately, as his weapon, the mark belongs to one summon.
Unlike the common sword, the common sword is only equipped with a "normal" weapon.
Rod was an exception, although he had no intention of using a normal weapon, he was unable to give up the attribute of starring, and it was because of this attribute that Rod was able so easily to eliminate the levels and monsters that were close to him or even slightly higher, gaining so much experience in the early days.
On the other hand, this made it impossible for Rhode to take the kind of "attack with summons" that a summoned swordsman does, and he appeared to be more of a regular swordsman.
This made Rod quite uncomfortable, but there was no way.
If he wants to summon the bird of the soul, he will give up the mark of the star, but in this way Rod will be faced with an ironless situation, though the call is mainly, but don't forget the two words after it are the swordsman, not the magician,
So Rod can't do anything behind him like those healers.
But if you're going to use stars, you're going to have to seal the soul birds, and if you're fighting like an ordinary swordsman, it's no good for Rod.
Because summoning swords have one of their greatest weaknesses, which is their professional punishment - all sword skill-1.
In other words, the most skilled swordsman can be upgraded to SSS. But summon swordsman even more effort, can only SSS cap.
And at the beginning, the starting line is different.
All Beginning Skill Levels are D.
Rod's summons can only begin with E, which is the difference, can be said, in fact from the beginning of the world until now, Rod has played very hard.
I'm afraid he'd been a mess if he didn't have a handful of stars and an understanding of the Dragon's mainland.
Since he was already familiar with the state of summons around and around and fighting with himself, now this state feels very great pressure on him.
Now, with the "call master" talent, he finally feels the shoulder light.
Yes, summon swords do not have as strong individual attack capabilities as regular swords, but they are never single-gun sword fighters either.
Faced with the soul bird, the stone like a ghost, it felt the magical breath on the other, but the unremarkable artificial intelligence has no way to judge what is the thing thrown at itself, but it still recognizes the other as the enemy, a claw.
But this time, the stone ghost is empty.
As soon as he felt his claws hit the other, the solid form suddenly disappeared, as if a snowball had been struck, and instead a weak air flowed from between his claws and disappeared.
But before the stone had a reaction, Rod had quickly followed, and soon after he held the long sword and threw it forward.
A silver arc burst out of Rod's sword, flying toward the target of the open door.
This is the third skill of the Moon Sword.
Although, like the broken blade, it is a trick to attack with a condensed sword, but the effect of both is completely different--the shape of the broken blade is the shape of the light edge forward, although powerful, transmitting great power, but the range to be covered is too narrow, easy to escape.
But unlike the moon, the moon's curved attacks sweep across, and at least a large area in front of them can be a threat, even if it is difficult to escape.
Indeed, faced with the sword light, the stone ghost subconsciously wanted to fly the wings to hide from the attack of the other, but it was slower than a step, was swept by the silver and white light blade of the right wing, accompanied by the flight of a few small pieces of stone, the stone ghost originally floating in the air body also suddenly slope, lost balance.
But it wasn't over, because just as it was going to keep its balance, Rod had taken the first two steps, and then he had his left hand out to the next wave, making a strange gesture.
At this moment, the soul bird, which was originally made as a wind flickered past the stone ghost, the whirling wind again condensed its body, and accompanied by a crisp cry, the wind bird, which was wrapped by the wind, hit the stone ghost heavily behind, the strong wave of the outburst immediately blow the stone ghost away,
This made Ben scream his anger, but before he had expressed his anger, a shining blade appeared in the eyes of the stone.
One, Two, Three.

Rod finally regained the feeling he had when he was fighting, in fact if he had the normal weapon in his hand, he would be able to attack both summons simultaneously by opening the summon master,
Don't say two rare elites, even if BOSS is near he also holds the other alive and dead.
Unfortunately, there is no "if", and Rod does not currently have a second soul core that can be used to awaken the spirit.
So he had to give up the idea of winning the fight and turn and fly backwards.
Because just then the second stone like a ghost had fallen over.
Probably because of seeing his companions wounded, the stone-like-devil attack was quite fierce, but Rod, who had been able to summon the soul bird, naturally did not intend to be as foolish as it was hard to touch, faced the shadow that had already made him confused, and Rod did nothing but raise his head, and then blow a whistle.
Immediately there was a sudden wind from the side, which pushed away the darkness which had intended to attack Rhode, and caused him to stop, after having lost his head for seven or eight hours, before hitting the wall of the nearby church.
Rod certainly wouldn't have given such a good opportunity.
Under his command, the blue cyclone rose flat, the flying birds spread their wings, once again, to the enemy before them.
For a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The two stone ghosts that were once in the sky were now as if they were a drowning dog, and Rod, who had been under great pressure and support, was now immediately turning to sing and taking over the favourable position.
He consciously allowed the soul bird to cooperate with himself, forcing to separate the two stone-like ghosts, so that at any time they could maintain the "two-to-one" situation, and forcing one of them to come to the rescue in time.
Although the situation has changed for some time, Rod has no way to get any further combat, because his powers have already been exhausted most of the time, and although in the game, the player can be reborn "in full" after the upgrade,
But it's obviously not possible to give you such a good thing. So, although Rhode has ascended to the tenth level and opened the talent number, his soul power is only added on the original basis to the part that should have been upgraded.
Relying on these alone is no way to eliminate the two stone ghosts.
Moreover, while manipulating the two summons, Rhode's soul power is consumed more than before, and he has to pay more attention than before to avoid himself being "discharged".
After all, the level gap is too big, the stone ghost defense is not blown,
Before Rod's attacked only one of the wings, without causing any particular damage to the wings themselves. In this case, if Rod's firepower was full, it was indeed possible to destroy one of the stone ghosts.
But when all his power wasted, he had to face the other one alone without any iron - as a result of what anybody with a bit of brain could have imagined.
Now the only thing that Rod can do is to make sure that puts these two disgusting guys under control, and waits for that "control center" to be found by Lizzie and Meas.
Otherwise, the situation will change back to the same.
Although a wing wasted, the stone ghost did not lose the threat, it climbed on the ground, like a black stone giant, four claws flying, like a ghost running on the ground.
That's what's terrifying about these alchemy creatures, and if you think of them as monsters that only glow in the air, you're going to lose a lot.
Fortunately, Rod knows them very well.
Although he didn't think as a newcomer that just throwing a stone like a ghost from the sky would do them any good, this made Rod feel much less stressed, after all he didn't have to spend too much energy worrying about his head.
A dark figure appeared behind Rod, a stone like a ghost crying out his right claws to dig into Rod's back, but at the next moment, Rod flashed sideways, his hand white unwashed sword blade turned into a flash, able to resist the attack of the other.
Meanwhile, Rod stretched out his left hand, and the soul bird around him, after seeing his gesture, immediately sounded a flying wings, able to resist another stone-like ghost trying to attack him from the air.
Although it hasn't been able to do too much damage to this rare elite of the soul bird, as a pure elemental creature, only blocking is not particularly difficult for it.
With time passing by, Rod's heart became more and more anxious, and he felt that his body was a little tired, and even that his spirit was a little restless, a manifestation of the moment when the power of the soul was almost exhausted, and there was no movement in the church at this moment,
Haven't they found a control center?
"Come!"
There was a tremendous wind from Rod's side, which caused him to be shocked, and he consciously flashed to the side, trying to start the flash, but just as he was preparing to escape, there was a moment when the footsteps, and the skill that was supposed to start, lost its effect.
The Soul Power will soon be exhausted!
This made Rod sink in, but at this moment he could not think more, hastened to turn back and struck a sword past.
The hard stone claws with the white long sword.
The stone-the stone-the stone-the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-
Just then, suddenly, a sounded from behind him.
"Mr Rod! We Found!"
CHAPTER 18 The Heart
"Mr Rhode! We've found it!"
Hearing this voice, Rod looked back at once, and saw Meas, with a surprise, standing at the door of the church, with a beautiful little statue in his hand, engraved on it by a crouched stone ghost, with two eyes made of fragments of red stone casting a shadow of dark red.
That's the center!
As alchemy creatures, they of course know what the other holds, and soon, the two alchemy creatures immediately shifted their direction, and rushed past them.
"Wow!"
Seeing the two terrifying monsters running towards him, Meas screamed without any hesitation, he consciously wanted to turn and run, and at this moment, the voice of Rod had passed.
throw it away!
While looking at the two evil monsters, Meas had a perception that he would be completely torn apart in the next instant, he was still hard-headed and threw out the black, made into a fine sculpture.

Faced with the big present, the stone ghost was astonished, but it still unconsciously extended its claws, trying to hold the little statue.
But just as it was about to win, a breeze passed from beneath it, and the spirit bird, who had almost lost its form, carried through the air a series of semi-transparent fluctuations, and the hard-working snatched the statue.
This was the last of Rod's powers, and he had to take up his long sword, while his right hand went up and hit a finger.
Along with this sound, the soul bird beautiful in the air, and then flew over to Rod.
The two stone ghosts also stopped immediately in the middle of the way, and shifted again.
"Oh!"
Running on the ground like a ghost turns, the coarse-shaven tail abruptly flies, hits heavily on the soul bird, though it did not cause much damage, but wrapped, around the soul bird circle the blue wind element is slightly distorted, even with the bird's form is distorted.
The blue bird did not give up on the way, it still strived to beat the wings, flew fast from the ground, strived to fly to his master.
But it didn't reach its intended destination.
A giant stone claw descended from heaven, through the body of the blue bird, and the elements of the disturbed wind could no longer maintain the strength of the condensed body, instantly became the most primitive existence disappeared.
As a result, the black statue, which had been carried by the bird into the mouth, flew out, but soon, two dark figures followed from behind, and they extended their claws, opened their mouths, and stretched toward the statue before them--until it quietly and steadily fell into Rod's hands.
[the stone demon control center has been identified]
[Directive -]
"Aig!"Rod's voice was not great, or even low.
But the darkness that had attacked had changed now-some of the shining bodies had changed in the blink of an eye into darkness, the limbs stretched out in the air had stopped as if solid, and the strange red light that had burned on the stone like a ghost had disappeared in the instant.
Afterwards, two dark shadows brushed over Rod and hit him again and again on the ground behind him.
"Bow!"
Along with the sound of the collision, the lost power of the stone ghosts turned back to the original sculpture, they maintained the motion of just flying forward, now quietly lying on the ground not far behind Rod.
After losing their magical support, they were no longer as strong as they were before, and under the impact, the two stone like ghosts were inadvertently displaced.
From the original art sculpture became worthless garbage.
"Call..."
It wasn't until then that Rod was able to breathe.
At this moment he wasted, and the excess of soul power made his legs soft, and even holding the right finger of the statue could not breathe.
However, on the surface, Rod had a calm look, he stood silently on the ground, and after a moment put the statue into his pocket.
"Mr. Rod!"
At this point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Are you all right?
"I'm still fine.
Rod breathed deeply, and now he really wanted to sit down and take a rest, although in the game, the excess of soul power can have all kinds of manifestations, but really on his own he feels a little uncomfortable, but now he can't fall.
Fortunately, the shadows of the ghosts were no longer visible in the thick fog around them, and it seemed that they had finally made a choice to give up and move away from the forbidden land.
Although it doesn't mean they've given up, it's always a good thing now.
But Rod hasn't said much, and it's been his custom since he was commander, that a team commander has to stay calm at all times, so that he doesn't get overwhelmed by a small thing.
If you're screaming because of a little difficulty, or if you're excited to lose your enemy, then there's absolutely no positive effect on your team.
Now, although Rod is no longer the president of the club that controls tens of thousands of players, this habit is still affecting him.
But I have to say, seeing his coolness, let some nervous Leigh and Mees loose their mouths.
After all, they're always worried about what's out there, about what's going to happen.
Liz did her best to find the little statue in one of the corners, and she had to say that was her luck.
If it were a little later, the situation would be completely different.
Rod's original intention was to pass through the fog at the fastest speed, but the appearance of the two stone ghosts forced him to change his mind, after all the two stone ghosts almost exhausted his powers, and if he did not rest and recover, then the next fight would be more dangerous.
So Rod finally decided to rest in the church one night, and to continue the next day.
He's not worried about any surprises here. In the game's version, the church is also a place for many players to rest and organize their battles, so there's no big problem.
Though Maes looked at the black church and the horrifying decorations, it was a pity, as always.
He had no say in any way against Rod's decision.
The sky was getting darker.
A thick fog wandered outside the church, and looked through the window, and saw nothing but a blank.
The three were sitting in the center of the church, which had been abandoned, and the rotten prayer chairs and tables were made of wood, playing the last bit of heat in the burning pile,
The cold wind from the cracks of the broken windows and walls, with the coldness of silk.
Leigh carefully extended her hand, took off her left chest bandage, and then her beautiful eye frowned a little.
It broke again, Mr. Rod.
"I know."
Rod nodded and said nothing.
It wasn't actually the first, after all, it was Rod who was at the front of the battle, and although he had avoided using his left hand in the light of his chest injury, he hadn't taken that much into account when he had encountered some particularly unpleasant trouble,
And this leads to his wounds from time to time, which, according to Leigh, would have been better if he had kept quiet for two or three days,
You can't reply for a dozen days.
But the girls had no way of complaining because it was after all for them, So the only thing that Lily could do was to help Rod change a clean bandage every day to avoid infection,
Fortunately she had little to carry as a spirit before she left the floating ship.
After removing the bandage, the wounds in the light of the fire allowed all to breathe in the cold of their mouths, and Meas even felt his chest with palpitations, and looked at Rod's chest with some fear.
There was a thin black claw on the three legs now that Rod's chest was full of bloody black scars, many of which had been torn apart before the fierce battle with the stone-like ghosts, red blood leaking out of them, mixed with those already black blood clots, it seemed to be a cold in the heart.
Liz took out her handker, poured water from the kettle, then pressed on Rod's chest, which made the latter's body instinctively convulsive, and even Maes showed an impatient look, turned straight and did not want to see again.
"Yes, I'm sorry, but does it hurt?"
It's all right.
Faced Li Ji's panic inquiry, Rod shook his head,
Although there is some pain, it has not yet reached the unbearable level.
When she heard Rod's answer, she let go of her mouth and continued to wipe Rod's wounds, and at the same time, the girl began to sneak at the young man who was slightly larger than herself.
Frankly, when we first met, Rod had a very common impression on Leigh, for he was very tall and very white, and Leigh thought of him as a kind of noble.
However, because Rod's attitude was not as loud as those of the nobility that she had seen, she was able to accept, but at that time she did not look too heavy on the other, after all, a man who looked like a woman, and the first impression of a man was largely weak.
But afterwards, Li's opinion changed slowly.
Unlike the nobles, the young man possessed considerable power, not even inferior to his leader, and his character was very steady, accompanied by him would be very relieved, even in the face of danger, would not panic.
And unlike his appearance, this is a very strong man.
Liz knew how painful the wound was and she had treated many as a healer, and many of the warriors who did not wrinkle their faces in the treatment of the wounds were screaming and screaming,
But Rod had noise from the beginning to the end, not to mention he was standing in front of the battle with such heavy wounds...
Liz's hand stopped.
What are you thinking?
It's awful.
The girl shook her head, threw those strange thoughts into her head, and then she continued her work.
Rod did not notice the strangeness of the girl around him, and at this moment his attention was concentrated on his right hand, in the center of his palm, lying two scattered jewelry of dark red colour.
That was one of the war's gains, the heart of a stone-like ghost.
Chapter 19 Upgrade
As a careful guardian, Stone is said to be the most beloved of all the wizards, but since they are wizards, most of them choose to do their best, although as guardians, Stone Stone is a good thing, but it is a great waste to use it as a bodyguard, so for many wizards, Stone Stone can be used not only as a guard, but also as an insurance box.
These two stones are like ghosts.
In their fragments, Rod found many good things, as the rare elite of the fifteenth level, the "fall" of the stone-like ghosts is really true to their rare elite status, besides the gems, crystals and some gold coins, Rod also found three magical items in them.
Cold Shields [Eletic]: When attacked, can automatically trigger cold shields, resist 50 to 150 damage, immune water attribute attack.
Oath Keeper: Holder can increase +5 magic effect. +5 magic resistance.
Magical Rules: A "magic" can be activated every ten natural days for half an hour
They're all very good fortunes if they're sold to auction.
But unfortunately, they are the equipment of the practitioner.
Eventually, these items were given to Leigh, as a spirit, although not an attacker, but as an advantage to her, so that Rod gave her the ice guard and the oath guard, and left himself with the mist command.
In the game, the skill of the ring was quite helpful to the self-brushing person, so Rod was uncomfortable to leave it.
It was a surprise and astonishment for Leigh that she had nothing to do with the two supplies, which in general, although they had received a lot of magical supplies when they ventured out, were usually sold to the commander, who then had the money to keep the whole company running,
It's hard to imagine giving it directly to others.
This also shows the difference between the NPC and the player.
As a part of the world, the ultimate goal of the mercenaries is only to make a living, so even if they find rare equipment, most of them will not stay.
As a matter of fact, many small crews rarely take on tasks that are too difficult, and they even do lifelong trilogy tasks that don't work well for the players, because the aim of these crews is to make a living, and that's all.
Those who are qualified to receive magical equipment, are usually high-minded, high-powered persons in the commission.
What about the unpowered mercenaries? Just watch their mouths water.
But unlike the players,their goal from the beginning of the world is better, higher, stronger, better equipment, more experience, higher reputation, stronger characters, that's what the players are pursuing.
So for them magical equipment is not a rare commodity, and for the players they don't worry about getting stuck in their hands -- they'll sell it as soon as they find a better one.
It's like the three spells in front of you, and in Rod's eyes it's a 10 to 15 level transition, and then it doesn't make any sense, and while the cold spells are good, Rod doesn't need them,
If he is able to have a water element high summon spirit, then he can also get the effect of an immune water attribute attack, so distributing this "low-end" equipment is not much for him.
Unless a legend such as the Sword of Heaven or the Heart of the Holy, a false legend or ancient-class object, he will consider it.
But it seemed to me that equipment was very high, and that even the commander of a medium-sized mercenary had only thirty-five pieces of magical equipment, and the magicians had more.
However, as ancillary profession, it is difficult to acquire equipment.
Moreover, in terms of their position and nature, they are generally not required.
And now, as a spirit of a small mercenary, she's got two good spells in a blink?
It even makes Liz question whether she is dreaming.
Meas, on the other side, however, saw more from it than from Liz.
As a merchant, of course, Meas was able to understand how precious a magical device was, especially those that, in Meas's opinion, were worth twenty-three thousand dollars even if they were sold at the North's most prosperous harbour, Karag.
But Rhode gave them, calm as if they were a piece of bread rather than a piece of equipment, which was not the kind of calm that a young man puts on in order to be cool in front of a beautiful girl,
It's a calm-that is, Rod really didn't look at these magical devices.
This is certainly not what the common man can do. Meas and many others, among whom are the mercenaries and the nobles, but for them these magical devices are also quite expensive.
Very rarely do people throw away with their hands, and they don't look like Rod, like they don't look at the equipment at all.
What does that mean?
This means in the eyes of this young man, that this magical equipment is not worth at all.
And it's clear that young man is very likely to come from somewhere else.
If Meas had previously only regarded Rhode as an ordinary member of the countless nobles of the continent, he had now begun to relate the young man to the great nobles or to the royalty of ancient times, and to the families that possessed the many magical devices, and to the families that regarded them so lightly--as if a man who possessed countless riches did not care for the loss of a small amount of money, though it might be to the common man that they could not earn in a lifetime of extreme poverty.
This thought made the fat merchant uncomfortable at times. As a small merchant, he had little chance of meeting with the nobles of the world who had a long history. After all, the nobles had great helpers, and a small merchant like him could not be seen.
And now that opportunity, if he can grasp well, say, there will be no hope.
But that thought washed away, thinking of himself as a pig, though the young man hadn't complained too much, but the fat businessman himself knew-that he hadn't shown himself to be worthy of the attention of the other, which made him feel uncomfortable again.
Rod didn't really care about the three; in fact, what he cared about most was the two heart-shaped stones in his hand.
Their Hearts.
The Human Spirit.
This seems a little complicated, but if you're a player, if you're a robot, then the stone ghost's heart is the chip.
Value is not a word.
In the dragon's mainland, alchemical creatures are very high-tech, creation of life is the patent of God, even the philosopher can not contradict this, and the artificial soul is the one they push and seek the next helpless choice.
For this reason, the complete human soul core is very rare, and not every magician can learn.
But fortune tellers, having a gold creature is one of their highest goals-as if a wealthy man had to have a racing car to prove his worth.
This kind of physicist usually looks very close, there is very little circulation in the market, there is very little production, the natural price is very high.
With normal auctions, tens of thousands of gold won't run out, and if it were on the black market, it would be higher, divided by color, and the best synthetic soul core could even be sold by millions, which would be enough to buy a tiny piece of territory.
Besides, therapists are very rich.
But Rod doesn't care about the money, years of player experience tells him a reason, money can be earned at any time, and how much money is earned is not enough.
But there are things that money can't buy.
For example, another ability of the stone-like spirit.
Force Force Force Force Force Force Force Force.
Their experience is shared with the holder, and generally, if Rhode gains 1,000, he actually gains only 700, and the remaining 300 are gained by the spirits in the battle.
Although this third of the experience does not seem to be too much, it accumulates more and more, and this is why summoning the swordsman is more difficult to climb the peak than other professions.
In fact, according to the rules of the game, if Rhode was a different occupation, then he had an experience of eating a replica of a ten-level five, up to now at least should have been twelve-level, but due to the sharing of blue birds and stars, until then Rhode had just started ten-level.
As for his calls...

Levels of summoning spirits are 10, and after 10 there is an opportunity for evolution.
After evolution, they not only change, but the upper level will increase again to ten levels, until the third evolution.
Their ability is to force up one level of summoning spirits to the tenth level, and then to initiate evolution.
This not only leaves more experience, but also reduces the time to practice.
What is not paid for?
Time is money.
Rod doesn't know what the level limit is, but according to his experience, the summon card level at the end of the set is usually not too high, and the three-dead evolution is the limit.
If the two stones in your hands were to be smashed into the heart of the ghost, then at least when fighting with the same level monsters, the enforced upgrade of the class sword would not go to rob Rod's experience.
But...

Rod didn't go, but now he feels a little strange.
Only this one?
How did the previous system tell him that he had only one tenth of the permanent card, and turned into this one?
So what about the remaining nine?
And this is the tenth, the last one, and it should have nine cards in front of it.
However, there is no card set in the game, because it is only a real souvenir, in the background of the game, Rod has not heard any information about the Sword set.
It is also unlikely to be hidden in the game, because the card was born after he won the competition, and because he founded a society called Starlight, the company specially designed such a card for him as a prize and as a souvenir.
This kind of temporary work is impossible to get into the game system.
But anyway, try.
Thinking about it, Rod reached out his right hand and held one of the stones to his heart, and soon a system of hints appeared before him.
Explore the Heart (magic), is it used?
Use.
Rod gave an answer.
Along with Rod's answer, the summon array that appeared on his right hand, instantly flashed out the likeness of the absence of magic, then, the dark red gem broke under the light, transformed into powder disappeared.
Suddenly, new information appeared before Rod again.
Goal
Star.
Rod looked down and answered.
Objective - - - - - - -
[grade upgrade complete]
Are You Evolving?
Yeah.
The blank card once again appeared in Rod's hands, and the glow that it spread out left neither Leigh nor Mees wondering.
At this moment, a system suggestion was also emerging from Rod's eyes.

That's good!
Seeing this system's suggestion, Rod nodded with satisfaction, that the marks had three special skills, which were all attached to the weapon, that is to say, that the release of these skills did not consume Rod's spirit power.
And the number of the use three every natural day is also calculated to be superior, can imagine, in the fight must play a great role.
But the next system suggested, but Rod did not give a slight.
