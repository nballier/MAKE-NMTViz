CHAPTER VII
It's what Song and others wanted to ask, was taken out first, you look at me, I look at you, all don't know what's going on, where the answer comes out.
Yu immediately flew to the place that made a huge sound, Yan Shu three immediately follow.
Song and others looked at a glance, also followed up to see exactly.
When they came to the door of the mountain, they saw the moon, and the three-letter stone engraving had broken a place, and all the people were astonished that there had been a man who had destroyed the mountain door of the east entrance.
He turned back, looked at Song and others, and laughed more than: "Well! I just arrived today, and it seems that there are people waiting to give me a ride! Well!
Song and others were in astonishment, they understood in the words of the other, but this is absolutely not done by them, because they were just sitting around together a little gathering, and are discussing how to look at the future to Miaoyi, and heard the unusual noise before running out.
Several people have doubted whether they did it, see it like this, and think that it is not necessary to break his own mountain gate to look at the color, after all, that苗毅 is the owner of Donglai-dong, has just been appointed by people to break the sign is a disgraceful thing.
This must be said clearly, or once stabbed into bearing this responsibility, Song holds up his fist, "The cave master, this is not what I will do!
Several others followed, seemingly for the first time in eight years to treat Miao as the master of the cave.
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
He is not here, and now it is not good to say that I am not going to put you in the eyes of the cave master, so he is not here, only to hold the fists 'True' replied: 'The cave master has just come and may not know the situation, the east came to the city has not been sent, I wait for the meals are all handled by myself, for the sake of the belly, the subordinate leaves for a while, did not think it happened such a thing.
Prince Fa and others hold the fist to prove: "The master of the cave, I wait to prove, the brother of Song is just eating with us.
Miao said with a loud voice, Is it you who fell down? Don't tell me it was blown down by the wind!
Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song
Seong's eyes flickered uncertainly across the crowd and said in a tone of darkness, "Is there anyone who comes to me east to get into trouble?"
Everyone was astonished that was possible and looked around quickly.
"What are you waiting for here? Don't you want to get your neck washed out in your sleep?
"Yes," said the three men, holding their fists down, and hurrying around the forest.
"Well," said Mia, "I'm not going to look for you," "I'm not going to look for you," he said.
At this time how to show that is not related to himself and others, Song Shu immediately turned around, drinking: Don't follow the order of the cave master to search!
Their hands were stretched out at once.
However, Song was called by Sung Yi, "Song Song, you come with me!
Therm, therm, therm, therm, and therm.
As soon as they left, a shadow like the shadow of the water appeared on the ground, not the others, but the old white shadow of the age of fashion.
Looking at the fallen stone gate, he shook his head and smiled, "The world is like a chess, a hot-blooded man is only a pity! I have always been worried that your little man is too good in nature, easy to lose.
At the end, the whole man's shadow wandered like a wave, and disappeared silently in the wander.
In the east of the torch shaking, Song stood behind Seung Yi one by one in the hall, outside the black charcoal has stood up, seems to have noticed what sneezed.
He stared at his throne with a blank face, leaned back at Song, and did not speak.
The atmosphere between the two a bit depressed, Song waited for a moment, at last he could not help asking,What does the master call me?
"You know what's wrong with you," he said.
With a grinning, he glanced at the dining table, and said softly, This is not what I'm doing, what is wrong with Song?
That's not what I'm asking! Turned around, stared at him, and asked coldly one word at a time, "I'm ordering you to guard the mountain gates, why do you stay away from the guard? Why don't you keep my cave master's orders in your eyes!"
Song thought, What do you think?
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
"Do you think that when I report the matter, the lords and the lords of the mountains will believe your explanation?"
Song said with a smile: "Your mouth has two skins, so please don't blame Song, but don't forget that someone has a mouth to argue, not a dumb."
"It looks like you don't have to repent!"
As soon as this was said, Yan, Uniformity, and the Cheu Shao group appeared together outside the door, and went in to hold Qian Yu: "The master of the cave, for the time being, did not find any suspect."
"The suspect is in sight, why not find a word! "
Simplification and the Cheu Shao group seem to have received the encryption, quickly flashing to shut the door.
Sung,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Song quickly pulled out with him sword, a cold light out of the sheath, quickly dozen as a buckle against.
Single and the Cheu Shao group almost instantly shot out, joined hands surrounded Song.
Yan and Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song
Shameless robber!
Being surrounded and unable to escape, Kan waved his sword and Yan Shu was struggling to be together with Song's grieving cry, and before he had finished, was hit hard by the two guns coming hard by the defense of the force, hit hard into the chest.
Song shook his eyes trying to look back at Seung Yi, shaking lips, the anger in his eyes can not be described.
He finally realized that was a conspiracy, that the collapse of the mountain gate was not only to plunder him, but also to leave his own gate, to prevent him from rebelling against it, and the main purpose was his own life.
CHAPTER VII
Don't kill now!
Yan raised his sword, and without hesitation, dropped one of his axes, and cut off his head.
Single and the Cheu Shao group also pulled guns from Song's arm.
The three still jumped, and immediately looked at the young.
He did not intervene, but did his best to protect a table of wine from being attacked by several men.
At this moment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The three arched hands and fled quickly to the palace, disappeared.
It was at this time that苗 went to the gate, opened the gate, crossed the threshold, reached out and touched the black coal mantle, looked out at the moon.
His eyes were cold, and in his mind the picture was of himself with one hand, with the other with the third hand, in the face of a group of adults who deceived the door, he was helpless in his grief, a knife was placed on his thigh, blood was pouring...
Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother
S S S S S S
His black and green beads flashed a weak light.
Black Charcoal shook his head and sneaked...
Their fighting and Song's cry before he died drew him back to the same door.
Prince Fao and Zhu Tian-the three masters of the white flower-the merchants came again, the侯胜, the king Xuechen, and the southern thinkers came again.-the Yan Shu, the Single-minded and the Chu Shao group finally arrived, and seemed to have heard the silence.
A group of people who wanted to enter the hall to see what, but were blocked by the cross-shooting of the horses outside the hall.
He rides across the dragon, holds the silver gun, is at the end of the stairs at the gate of the great hall, sits high and looks down at the people.
Outside the hall the darkness, the moon shining.
Within the hall, behind, the torch of the bright hall, the visual error between light and darkness makes it a little difficult to see the appearance of Miaoyi, added some mystery and some dignity, at the same time can feel from Miaoyi's killing breath.
Look at me, I look at you, and finally the Prince asked the archman, "Lord of the cave, we just seem to have heard the fighting, and the cry of the brother of the Song, dare to ask the brother of the Song can be in the palace!"
"Yes, but I'm already in a different place!" Mia did nothing to hide. She lifted her hand to the side of her leg, and put on someone's hair, and a head came out of her hand.
Astonished, the consciousness retreated, only to see a large good head rolling by the feet of the people stopped.
Their eyes widened and they saw who was not Song.
The Three Later Yan Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu
Prince Far Hoen, pointing at the steps, said angrily: "You killed the brother of Song?"
Then, without any feeling, he said coldly, "I have commanded him to guard the mountain gates, and he has taken the liberty of destroying the mountain gates to which I came from the east, and I have asked him whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he has the liberty to speak unto the Lord of the caves, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether
As soon as this was said, Prince Fa and others immediately dragged their swords, pointing to Miai, Prince Fa said, "You dare to kill my Blue Temple disciple!"
Be bold! cried Mia, and warned him, "While I am a disciple of any of your sects, since you have joined my Eastern Cave, I must forget the sect's idea of following the rules.
His gun pointed downward, Song is not the first to die in my hands, nor is it the last!
The Three Yan, behind the people, immediately lighted up the weapons, and shouted: Here!
"If any man dare to do this," said he, "these are for me, and the other four are for you to settle."
"Follow me!" ""Follow me!" ""Follow me!" ""Follow me!" ""Follow me!" ""Follow me!" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" """Follow me!"" """Follow me!"" """"Follow me!"" """""Follow me!"" """"""Follow me!""" """"Follow me!"" """"""Follow me
It was a good negotiation, in any case, Song supported the stab, and before Yu decided, anyway, to kill as soon as possible.
The remaining princes, Fa and Zhu Tian, two monks of the three varieties of white linen, who, although they were not able to get rid of them, had the help of a black charcoal foot, and were able to bind the two without any problem.
Of the remaining four, there are three monasteries headed by the emperor, Yang, and the Cheu Shao group, which are also sufficient to deal with.
Once it's really done, the three Yan toss down the four back horses will help Miao to deal with the prince law and Zhu Tian table, the chances of winning are great.
The Blue Temple disciple looked forward on the stairs at the horse, then looked back at the tiger looking at the three, immediately fell into two difficulties.
In the first Battle of Floating Cave, everyone as a bystander saw, Prince Fa and Zhu Tian's coat of arms may not really be able to fight under the sleek, once dragged down, the other four White Lotus two-piece disciples faced Yan Shu the three-piece monk led two attacks, the failure is likely to be great, this battle they did not win.
Moreover, they did not know that Song's death was the result of the joint efforts of Yan Shu and others.
"Here, who dare fight me!"
"You killed our Blue Temple disciples. Blue Blue Temple will find a replacement for you."
The Prince said this, but had put down the sword in his hand, and did not dare to make a second, and the others followed and fell down the sword slowly.
"I don't care about the Blue Gate, I only care about the East Gate. If you don't agree to stay in my East Gate, even if you leave, I won't stop you, and if you want to stay and listen to my orders, I won't lose.
From this day on, but whosoever shall hear the word of my commandment in the eastern part of the cave, three beads of white lotus shall be three beads of rice a year, and two beads of white lotus shall be two; and whosoever shall not hear one bead of my commandment, let him go before me.
As soon as it came out, everyone was astonished, and so were the three Yan Shu, because they had not spoken to him before.
Now there are three priests to take nine, six two to take twelve, twenty-four to take twenty-one, is not the lord of the cave willing to climb up to this position and to give himself only three?
CHAPTER 72
The disciple of the Blue Temple wasted no effort to bind up Yang, for what? Is it not for the wish of the Pearl? Song's help was thrown to the back of the mind, first to clarify whether the cave master's words really said again.
After hesitting, Prince, you are not making us happy. You know that when you do, you yourself will have only three wishes.
It was not finished,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An ordinary pearl, shining with a faint white glow of will be very visible in the night, twisted between the slender fingers is very charming, let all eyes shine.
Everyone is not blind, and the eye is far superior to everyone, this is a gathering of all the wishes of the year!
"Three, two, nothing.""The wishful bead," which had entered into the vault, turned his finger, and looked down at the people, "If you will listen to my orders, I have my own way of getting more, and when you will get it every year, I fear that it will not be more than what I have promised.
Whoever sells his life for me, and whoever does good for me, the Lord of the cave will not give to him.
Excited, each excited, eyes shining!
If there were doubts to begin with, but to see the master can take out a pearl-sized wishful bead with his hand, immediately the heart jumps accelerated, such a level of wishful bead can not be produced in ordinary small town, Yang Qing and the general estimate will not give the wishful bead to the master, the master master is not doing well really have other wishful beads to come.
According to theology, a small temple like Dong, under the order of a monk, no matter how many you are, if you have no relationship with the master of the cave, one year for you, you do not have the temper, Yan Shu in the floating cave is an example.
Now, if, according to Miao, the supply of the power be double triple, then the master of the three of the white lotus to the hundred to the three hundred, and the master of the two of the white lotus to the hundred to the two hundred, what does it mean?
Someone even had a misfortune, rather than fighting to the death, to snatch the wishful beads in the hand of Miao.
But when I look back, I find that is not appropriate, one might not be a sleek opponent, and what is to be taken together?
Even if one could get it, it would only be worth ten millimeters, and it would be possible to get it under the audacity of the promise, that is, for more than three years.
For a monk, three years in the course of training not long, after taking this, after three years, what to do? Is it not to break his own way of finance?
After hesitting to his mind, the prince, with a hard head, held his fist and asked, "Does the lord of the cave speak?
"What do you think of me if I don't say anything," he said.
Prince Far and Zhu looked at the watch, the two turned back to look at their fellow disciple nodded.
All the swords in their hands, they stood in two rows, and cried with a loud voice, "Give me the order of the lord of the cave!"
Seong-dong is the place of his own.
But it is not so easy to say a word that can be spoken by anybody, said Mia, saying, "It is not possible to say it in your mouth.
After everyone looked at each other, once again, with the prince's law, hold the fist and show: "And please the master of the cave show!"
Saying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Everybody understands what he means, which is to get everybody on the matter, but the benefits are not so good.
In fact, I think that is not appropriate, I have been advised many times in private, but the Song Master does not listen, I have no need to wait, after all he is our master.
State Law,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
The others followed with their arches, and answered, "The master of the cave is right in punishment, I will wait and have no doubt!
Yan's three shredded, looked at each other, a little bit hated to scratch the teeth, had not seen such a good talk before the animal before deceiving them three, but now they are so good, all the responsibility to Song's arm.
The three looked at the sleek eyes became a little awe, from the master of the cave saw the means of turning the hand for the cloud to cover the hand for the rain, turning the hand between the whole of the eastern cave turned into the sky, no wonder the lord Yang Qiang has the power to assemble the assembly to let it sit in the town eastern cave!
"Song Fu may be evil, but after all he is a disciple of yours, and at the moment when it is worth cooperating with the Nan Emperor and the Blue Temple, it is not worthy for him to have a relationship with a Song Fu and two families, and it is inevitably to report this, to give an answer to the above.
When he said this, he paused, and glanced at the people, and said slowly, I am afraid that my one word will cause you to doubt the Blue Gate, and if you are willing to testify as one, it will naturally remove the doubt of the Blue Gate.
Do you know who will write down the testimony with me to the Lord of the mountains?
Yan, the three heard, could not help laughing, thinking that the master's hand was cruel enough.
The Prince, and others, they are to understand what is called to be a bitch and to set a table, the man who killed the Blue Temple does not want to be responsible, and wants to let the Blue Temple say the disciple under the door to live, are you not afraid of our Blue Temple, do not put our Blue Temple in the eyes?
"You don't want to write, I don't have to, but there's something you want to be clear about, and once the people of the Blue Gate come and look at it, they'll find out that you can get two or three wishes every year, and they'll be afraid that no one will look after my responsibilities, after all the wishes are bigger than the wishes of the Lord of the Cavern," he said, "and that the Lord of the Cavern will not be as big as I am, and that there'll be some of your neighbors who will try to take you away, and then they'll turn themselves in to serve me, and then I won't be able to stop you," he said.
It's a bit of a weakness, it's not possible, it's sure, and it's sure that somebody will come up with a way to replace them, and the Blue Temple disciple who's been assigned to the lowest level of work has nothing to do with it, and he's got to do something with it.
There are still some figures Nan thought he could not help but whisper in a low voice: "Lord King, Lord Song did not listen to the order of the lord of the cave, until the mountain gate was destroyed, it is indeed to be no excuse for it."
"It's..."
Several people answered in a low voice, and did not dare to say too obvious, in any case, it is such a meaning, believe the master brother can understand.
The Prince of course knows everyone's thoughts, do not want to be taken advantage of by others, but really to do this thing, that is to deceive the master, once on the brave thief's boat will not come down, not for people to be a cow to be a horse.
CHAPTER 73
Why is the temptation of the wish is greater, all willing to run down to the man's control for what? Not for the wish!
Under the w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w
"Nature!"
"Nature!"
Everyone nodded and understood the difficulties of the teacher, this thing is not good to take responsibility oneself, to take responsibility all together, otherwise it will not be safe afterwards if anyone does not feel pain quickly to stab the thing, only all take responsibility to be stable.
When they all agreed, they shouted together, "Let's listen to the Lord!"
Their eyes were filled with admiration for the master of the cave, and for a moment they dragged so many disciples of the Blue Temple into the thief's boat, and they could not resist.
But if you look back, and you find that you and the three are nowhere to go, Song was the one who killed the three by his own hand, and the thing stabs out, and they don't like it, dare to all go to the thief's boat, and no one wants to get down.
"Okay," said Mr. Miaoyi with a flash of silver in his hand, earned a reserve, turned his back on the ride, stood on the steps with his back on his face, "It's too early, you can write things now, I've seen, and if there's no problem, let's send it to the town of Haishan to the lord of the mountain."
Without saying a word, I found out that the owner really didn't want to give anyone a chance to repent, even for one night.
It's done. What can be done?
Immediately Mia raised her hand and said, Yan, give me a token.
Yang Shu ordered, quickly ran into the grand hall, took out a pile of dowry, one by one to the hands of all.
Then a group stood under the steps of the great hall, and each wrote a note.
There are some who, after waving their hands, feel uncomfortable and uncomfortable with the dead brother.
After someone finishes writing, they go upstairs and give things to Miao to check.
After seeing it, he nodded slightly: Good!
After someone had a look at it, Yu frowned, "You write like this, Song seems to be guilty to death, isn't it too lightly written?"
"I'll rewrite. I'll rewrite. "
After looking at another, Mia shakes her head, "It's too much, it's too bad to kill him again," she said.
It's gonna make you can't get off the stage.
Neither of the three have fallen, and have written one.
After all of them wrote a note, saying that Song did not obey the orders, and left the office, so that the mountain gate was destroyed, and dared to hit the lord of the cave, he himself was punished by the law, and to watch for Yu to kill him.
He wrote lower than all others, because he felt that should show the chest of the master, anyway so many people say the bad things of Song, and not the master of the one.
After writing and signing his own French seal, along with the east city master's note that had previously been modified by Yan Shu, he lifted his head and shouted, "One word!
A::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Immediately, star night send these things to the town sea mountain, report to the lord of the mountain, no mistake!
"Yeah!" "Yeah!" "Yeah!" "Yeah!" "Yeah!"
I don't know what expression will be after seeing these tables.
A group of people send the word disappear, thought, really don't want to spend the night.
After finishing the right thing, Miai loosened his voice, and said to Yan Shu: "Notify the lord of the city to come to see me tomorrow morning, to send all the people who are to be sent, not to affect everyone's normal life, to delay everyone's refinement."
Everyone was pleased with this, and a group of people immediately raised their hands, "The master of the cave is wise!"
"Don't be so happy. "You don't think that I don't know what kind of ghost you played with Song before. Song is not good at guarding the mountain gate, so that the mountain gate collapses.
I don't want to see the signs of my east entrance after tomorrow have been knocked down, and you guys have spent the night digging stones for me, and repairing the signboards for the sake of forgiveness, and don't make fun of me, but make it look good, and be cool!
Nobody's going to oppose now, but it's up to the people who are guarding the mountains tonight.
Miao Yi waved to let the people go, and turned back and said to the Cheu Shao group: "Put it in the big hall.
Yasu took Yasu to the private refining and sleeping place of the owner of the back palace, the black coal follows after no matter what rules.
Yan, who was leading the way, couldn't help but ask in a low voice, Master, do you give out so many wishes to everyone every year, is it too much?
He treated himself like a man of heart and mind.
"Why do you think I'm going to send something out when I'm not going to give it to them? " "They're not going to look for their responsibilities, even if they try to look at me."
?
Don't think too much.I'll just say that as long as the wishes are collected enough every year, I'll say the right thing.
He reached for the black char.
"After going out and doing something," I said, "I've come to understand that horses don't have nightmares, and that it's not a good thing to keep a fixed rate here, but we'll have to figure out another way to increase our income."
What he said was not a lie, but a real feeling, not to mention the kindness of the wishes of all kinds of bosses and daughters, the killing of Mor Mortu and Zhang Cheng, and the robbing of one from the lord of the Huangfang, he had a taste of a little bit of a tingle, longing to come east and east to clean up the man's horse ticket, the strength of a man is still too weak.
It was a little uncomfortable for the black charcoal to be stopped in the yard between the front and the rear halls, in front of which was the lodging and the refinement of the master of the seeds, and it was indeed uncomfortable for such a large piece of charcoal to enter, and it had to go straight to the door, lazy.
But here the garden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seong, who entered his private space with his back, couldn't help nodding, and found that the master's treatment was indeed unusual, the feet were thick blankets, and all around were beautiful displays, and luxurious elegance blended into one, which he had never seen before, and today it is open to the eyes.
Yan's mind is not here, thinking about the master's other way, and want to know where the master's wishful bead of wishfulness gathering all the people a year, trying to ask: "The master's so-called other way to increase the income does not know how to do?
"The best way is, naturally, like the lord, to occupy the whole of Nan. "
Yan was astonished, and even shouted, No, our strength is not enough to swallow the surroundings.
CHAPTER 74
Of course I know, now to rob other people's land, only to fear not to rob the land, on the contrary, to cause others to rob our land.
With a little bit of self-mockery, he shook his head, and turned to sit on the chestnut bed, and asked, "What do you think of our trip to the starship?"
"The Sea of Stars" Yan suddenly stared, and this is where he told Yu.
"What do you want to go to Starship? It's a fairyland filled with fairies! It's a fairyland filled with fairies, and there are almost no human monks who have entered.
"You're not saying that's not good enough for a fairy to replace a thousand wishes?"
It was also the last time Yang saw the war Lu Yu, Yang Shu told him.
Therm and therm can be refined into therm, which is also a source of power, therm is after all therm, which can not be refined, and each time it is used, the amount of energy contained in it is reduced, and the harder it is used, the more energy is consumed, and the natural need to replenish the energy.
So low level fairy is the best fairy energy supplement, there is a market of natural value, to exchange money or to exchange wishes.
Yan jumped with astonishment, "Lord of the cave, do not you think of hunting in the sea of stars?"
"Hah," I said, "I'm joking, seeing you're nervous."
After leaving Yan, he went back into his meditation room to see.
This is an underground space, not small, paved with polished thick stones, copper furnace oil lamp, light is moderate.
In front of a sitting stone, there were three great baths, with the heads of the giants, one of which drew mountain springs, one of which drew hot springs, and the two springs joined together in the other, to make a suitable bath.
Mia took off her clothes and buried them in the pond.
Early the next day, Miao, accompanied by a group of ministers, came to the mountain gate to inspect the newly built mountain gate.
Miaoyi washed up in the quiet room last night, and heard the axe chirping almost a night, and the six monks joined in the work a night, and the board made is not unusual.
There are three.
The main entrance is up to three heights, floating alive birds and beasts, and the clouds hanging between them, on the book 'East come to the cave' three awakening big words, below each one of the dragon sleeping tiger stone carving town guard around.
The whole Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple
To see him like, to be afraid of him deliberately troubled the Blue Temple disciple a bit, last night for the board was to hang the brain.
Everyone laughed when they heard the master of the cave.
"How can I look at your clothes? Those who don't understand think that I'm coming from the Blue Gate.
I don't care if you go back to the Blue Gate, but if you go back to the East Gate, you'll have to bring the colors together.
Yan, go back to the city to find a tailor, to change all the clothes to black.
"Yes," said Yang.
The disciples look at each other.
No matter whether they like it or not, Mia continued to look around at the board.
Just as the crowded around the board, Yan suddenly pointed to the mountain road on the side of the lake: "The master of the cave, should be the master of the eastern city.
When all looked, there was only a handful of people who were rolling along the mountains on the side of the lake, many carrying cars, and cars dragging horses, and they seemed to have brought many things.
Miao washed her eyes, and looked at the lake at the foot of the mountain, and said, Yan, look back and let people have some shrimp in the lake.
Yan, knowing that was probably prepared for black coal, the man, unlike the other wolves, liked to eat fresh fish and shrimp, and liked to play water, there was such a large lake here, turned into a black coal paradise.
"Prince, arrange for a man to guard the gate, and then this part of the mountain gate will be handed over to you to arrange for the men, and then they will be smashed and I will take you to test!
Miaoyi turned his hand and went, the east city lord is not worth standing here to welcome.
The Prince did not have much eyesight, and naturally did not arrange for the owner of the cave's trusted Yan Shu and others to guard the mountain gate, leaving the shopkeepers of the same gate to come and work.
Not long after the others returned to the eastern palace, the lord of the eastern city, Shun Shun, had climbed down the horse before the mountain gate, and the guests and the merchants had come again to inform.
There was no need to inform, the master already knew they came, the merchant came again and let them in.
No one dared to enter by horse, and all the rides were left outside, and only the large loads of cars and wagons that had been dragged behind Shu Shun-ryan were parked on the square outside the palace.
There were also sixteen carriages lifted gently down, and no one dared to lay down, all of which were given to the fairy's maid.
A Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master
Others were not allowed to enter the Great Hall, but the east lord of the city, who washed the sweat in his official robe, was afraid to take the box up the steps.
It's not that's what's going to happen to him, it's that every time he comes to the east to change his lord, which is when his lord's position is most insecure, the lord might change you if he sees that you're not paying attention.
In the Great Hall, Yan and others stand on the left and on the right, holding only the box entered Shun Shun did not dare to look up directly, low head to the position and immediately put down the sink of the box, kneeling down and knocking on the head: "The lord of the east city Shun Shun to see the lord of the cave!"
"I'll see you again," said Seung, who sat at the top.
When the lord of the city heard of it, he looked up, and found a little familiar, and immediately became aware of who had saved the fairy of the lady of the season, and did not think that he was the new appointed lord of the eastern chamber, the new lord looked so young!
Come up and speak!
The Lord jumped up immediately, took a small box out of his sleeve, and held it up with him, and said, The Lord Lord, this is the heart of the people of the east, and I hope the Lord Lord will take it.
There was a thing of the Huangfang, Mia didn't look or know what was in there, to Yan Zhu's little head, Yan Zhu immediately went and took the thing.
Chapter 75
Neither did hes the lord of the city, and answered him, and found that the lord of the city of the east was well acquainted with the living of the city, and encouraged him, and let him go.
Neither side has any common language to keep talking.
After the lord of Xu took the people away, Mei let Yan Shu bring the gift to open a look.
Indeed, in the small box there is a blossom of soft and faint grains of rice, the swift and uncompromising, directly into his saving bag.
And there were in the box five thousand, but not a small number: and they were of the city of the east, and of the city of the east.
There was some resistance to receive this kind of thing from the civilian, but not to receive it, the whole Eastern Cave is not he alone, so many people under his hand are to be fed by the Eastern City believers.
However, he did not have any left, so that Yan took some of the gold crystals and distributed them, and two hundred of each of the three pieces of white lotus, and half a hundred of the two pieces of white lotus, and left the rest for the money in the hole, and gave it to Yan Yan to keep.
Yan is in good mood, when floating hole, can not enjoy this management heart treatment.
Then they came out of the Great Hall to the square, and sixteen dressed girls stood in a row, not very old, waiting for the selection of the fairies.
For the first two appearances are more prominent, the pavilion stands, the head hangs low, like two bracts of the flower, the small fresh and pleasant.
The only disadvantage is that the age seems to be young, the body is not fully extended, the point is not sharp, the point is not sharp, nor is it sexy, it can only be said that there is no taste, and there may be people who like it.
Every one of those who were led by Mia looked at each other, and Mia was also a bit irritated, wondering what kind of goods Yan had chosen for himself.
Yan, who was next to Miao, said to the two girls who stood in front of him, "Come, you two, this is the master of the cave that you will serve!"
The two looked at Yan, and quickly looked at the sleek, low head, carefully moved to the side, the two without body, the voice of a bird cry, "Zhao Chen, Liu Snow, see the master of the cave!
The other maids couldn't stop looking at them, and there was a little admiration, even though they were maids of the gods, but as long as the fools didn't know, being maids of the master was not the same as being maids of the others.
They both lifted their heads to see what was going on, and said to him side by side, "They are both 15 years old, and she is a little older, and her name is Zhao Chen, and she is good at dancing.
She's called Liu. She's good at instruments.
Both are trained and do not know whether the master is satisfied.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
Seeing that was not, Yan tried to ask, If the master is not satisfied, can be changed again!
He thought for a moment that although normal men like beauty, he had a determination in his heart, no matter what the conditions, as long as he had not found the old two and the old three, he would not be close to the woman, if the old two and the old three were suffering at this moment, but his brother was enjoying...
But hes his head: Don't change, stay!
Keeping two people around, can also be less disturbance, beneficial training.
Thermenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmen
After everyone had a choice, there were two left, and Yan said to the Jiu Shao group, "These two groups have to go back.
Cheu Shao pointed.
At this time, however, it seemed that there were still two maids, and it was a little strange that Yang had personally been in contact with the eastern city, how did he leave himself alone?
Others may not have noticed, but in a moment, a strange loneliness glimmered from Yan's eyes.
Yan smiled, bowed slightly, " Yan is old, one is used to quiet.
The Prince and others immediately made fun of him, "No, no, no, no.
Nan and Wang Xian both women smiled, all have gained today, the mood seems to be good.
Yan smiled with a sweaty face and raised his hand to ask forgiveness.
The shameless woman, who jumped with a knife, washed her head and was humiliated, but was finally cut off the head...
Mia suddenly flickered across the screen, stared silently at Yan Shu for a moment, slowly turned his head, no more to say.
But he knew what Yan was for, to be honest, he had had little to say about Yan Yan because of the death of Roger, but today it seemed to him that there was something in this old man's habit of boasting that he was afraid it would be impossible to erase.
Along with those who died in the wake of the explosion, the Cheu Shao group, too, thoughtfully glanced at Yan, silently...
After each of them took their own maid back, Yan also called the two maids followed by苗毅.
The full-fed black coal still lay sleeping at the entrance to the back of the house, and the snake's tail swung to the ground, and was quite leisurely, and it was the old disease of the man.
Hearing the silence, he opened his eyes and looked, and saw that he had returned, sneezed, and closed his eyes again.
Several people stood in the yard, Zhao Chen and Liu Xu carefully examined the surroundings, the first curiosity and tension.
"They're just here," said Mei, "and they don't know what to do," he said. "You can arrange for them, and I'll take Zhu's watch to the consulate."
This is the first thing to do when you first come to the cave, it is not possible to sit on the side of the town without being familiar with your own territory, the first time to spend time or spend.
As soon as he came out, the black had his eyes open, his ears straight, and his head half raised.
Yan quickly shouted to leave, pointed to the two girls, reminded: "The master, you have not given them a name.
S S S S S S S S S S S
Yan smiled, "It was a common name, and now they are the owners of the caves, and according to the logic, the owners of the caves are given a new name, which means a new beginning of the supernatural, and everyone has done so.
"That's it," said Mia with a twist of his head. Although he had learned some culture from the old man, the ink in his belly was limited, and naming was not something he was good at, he finally laughed: "Zhao Chen, Liu Chen, you'll call Chen and Chen later!"
He got the name of the ministry, Yan shu shu shu, not good to say, turned back to the two waiters reminded: Don't thank the lord the name!
The two girls hurried to the ceremony, " thousands, snow, thank the Lord for the name! "
CHAPTER 76
Miaoyi put on his hands, didn't say much, didn't care for the two waitresses, thrown directly to Yan, turned away by a big step.
Outside the hall, the first to be greeted by the Zhu had changed his clothes waiting.
As soon as he came out, the black charcoal ran out from behind, snatched his clothes and dragged them away.
Zhu's eyebrows were frowning, and he felt a little overwhelmed. This was the Great Hall of the Eastern Chamber of Commerce, but the animal was like a circle running in and out, the top beams were wrong, the beams were wrong, and the master was accustomed to it, and he took a few whips to be honest.
Miao will not use whip, saved his life not to say, running faster than others is the advantage, can also play a mixed catch of fish, and the people who used know the advantage.
"I've got something to do. it's not convenient to take you to the lake, where there are shrimp.
Raise your fingers toward the lake.
The Black Coal opened his mouth, shook his head, sneezed, and flew to the square, leaving four feet to run.
The Lord's riding is a bit spiritual, and I can speak to it directly. It's not like I'm going to be able to ride, it's like the Lord's riding.
This guy is like a duck. It makes you feel like a duck.
Mei smile, know it is good to listen, black charcoal morality does not appeal to the outsider like he knows, like Qin Wei would like to kill it, but occasionally enjoy the taste of pissing is good, though this pissing is not good.
Outside the mountain, there were two horses left by the lord of the east.
Go to the city to see what you want to see, too, to see what is the power of the lord of the city, if not, to delay the wish of the pearl, the lord of the cave is afraid that it will not be long, to change the lord of the city or to change, to send a gift is not useful.
Out of the mountain gate,,,,,...
Zhenhai mountain, the plate sits in a quiet room, Qin Wei slowly compressed the two hands on Dan, the eyes of a flower open six petals of the flower lights resembling alive.
When she opened her eyes, she gazed at the red cotton and the green lily and said with joy, "Congratulations to the lord of the mountain on the construction of the upper floor.
Qin took hold of the force, the wishful pearl of the mouth, stretched out the legs of the bed, laughed, shook the head, "but just broke through the six of the white lotus.
She could see it in her mouth, but the invisible cheer of her face indicated her mood.
The two waiters laughed without saying anything.
It fell by the shirt, and soon, an arrogant fat before and behind was exposed in the quiet room, white spots of aromatic grass, it is estimated that even a woman looked will be heart pounding accelerated.
A pair of white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Red cotton and green grass helped her to remove hair and the two helped her to clean slowly.
While Qin washed her full chest with a white towel in her hands, she smiled, "The mountain lord is a good figure, and it is a pity not to find a double-trained official with such a good posture.
"No," said the back of the green lily, laughing and laughing. "It's just a wild thing!"
Qin's face turned red, and stared at her, "Two shy little girls!"
At one time the water splashed in the pool, the two ladies dare to return the hand, only to constantly beg forgiveness.
When ther was done, ther said with a straight face, Lord, I tell you a secret, that the lord had asked the two of us privately.
Qin Wei, who opened a pair of jade arms to wipe the two, immediately wondered: "What did the lord invite you to ask?
"The lord listened to the two of us, and asked if you had a pleasant man, and if he had, he would have thought of a way to arrange for you in secret.
Qin's face turned red again and said, Dad's not in shape!
The next time he asks, you tell him I'm not looking for.
"We don't dare say this to the lord," he laughed, "whether we think it's our advice, or we'll come back to you when you find a nice man."
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
Turn around and look at me, and if you're with men, look at the faces of the men who treat the maids as maids, and at the end they're not even maids of the house, and think of it!
Green Liu shut up and didn't dare to speak, but even the lord screamed in.
Red Cotton smiled,The mountain lord will wait,and we will help the mountain lord to see if the status of the mountain lord is suitable,and not the man who sleeps with the attendants.
Don't be ashamed, Don't you both have a thrill?Get you two to the man's room to be a concubine!
Asked what was right, Red Cotton smiled and said, "It's nothing, it's just that the east and the west have sent the evening messengers, and the messengers are still waiting in the mountain, waiting for the Lord's commandment to return to life!"
The guy hasn't been there yet, and he's on the piano so fast, isn't he making fun of me?
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
Shortly after returning, he took the sealed box with the playing table, opened and placed on the side of the pool.
Qin Wei held the side of the black hair on the snow white shoulder, leaned on the side of the shore, reached into the box and touched...
Why so many instruments, doesn't the guy write a long poem?
Take a piece of doom injected into the force to see, finish one and quickly see another.
As a result, it is foolish to look at, first to shake, then to look more and more confused.
After finishing, I thought I had the wrong look, and screeched, I looked at all the playing tables again carefully.
After finishing the second time not reassment, again the child carefully check, see if there is a foot to do.
Yang finally placed by the shore, Qin Wei's eyebrows tightened, his eyes sometimes flickered confused and puzzled, his mouth sometimes whispered, "What did this guy do..."
Without daring to disturb the master's public affairs, the red cotton and the green willows have seen Qin Wei something wrong, and do not know what the master of the seedling seedling hole wrote, can make the master of the seedling so, but did not see the master of the anger!
Look at the red cotton and the green柳 face, look at the quantity of the Yuan play is really enough, a play of the eastern to the whole town Haishan to the play of the master of the tower.
CHAPTER seventy- Qin Wei
Waiting half an hour, to see Qin Wei came out late, Red cotton tried to ask quietly, "Lord mountain, is there anything to the East come out?"
Qin, who had come back from God, still a little confused, not knowing what to say, raised his hand slightly, "Look, help me analyze what's going on down there.
Because of the maid's identity, this kind of thing, without the mountain master speak, the two do not dare to see.
Because of Qin Wei's state of mind, both want to know what is written in the dowry, now there is a mountain master's speech, the two are compelled to take the dowry to see.
I don't know, after seeing, two women too.
After the two women exchanged and looked at, also evidently had the same doubts as Qin Wei, worried whether it was a fake, again looked and checked again, twice.
However, the ten instruments are clearly written by ten different magicians, and the signatures on the instruments are unmistakable, like the fingerprints of everyone.
Finally, the green lily, holding the ultimate, said: "The owner of the seed hole is great! In the middle of the night he has taken over the whole eastern part of the hole!"
Qin, who was thinking about it, couldn't help turning his eyes white, looking back, and laughing, "Well, what about him, do you think it's possible?
"It's kind of weird!"
Both of them have been with Qin Wei for a long time, and are well aware of the situation in Nan Province.
For the lord Yang, the introduction of the blue jade gate, is to draw the wolf into the room.
Initially, Yang didn't want to retaliate, and wanted to accumulate power slowly, but the original lord Lu Yu couldn't see Yang Yang making a big, under the orders to Yang Yang to the side of the office, to disguise Yang Yang.
Yang knows that once he's gone to Liu Yu's side, Liu Yu won't have another chance to get ahead of himself.
It was because of Lu's action that Yang had to cut off the airplane and promised to cooperate with the Blue Gate, to kill Lu Lu and attack the southern province.
Yang and Blue Temple of course each gain, but some things both know well.
Knowing that Yang is not a person, must think of a way to cut off the influence of blue jade on Nan.
Young also knows that Blue Gate is not afraid to come now, but once lent by this entry, slowly connected up and down the relationship, will surely think of a way to take him Yang Qing instead.
It is because of the number of people who have worked in the system over the years, and because of the help of the lord, Yang Qing has not been able to admit that even if he beat Nan Chen, Nan Chen does not belong to him, instead it is not good to bear the guilt of counterfeiting.
Blue Gate does not dare to create a seed, which is missing is also the human blood, does not dare to fight against the huge institutional power.
However, if the relationship was tolerated, the people under the rule of the Southern Emperor could be more than the people under Yang, once it was difficult for Yang to resist.
Both sides understand that cooperation is temporary, at most after fifty years, both sides will have to tear their faces, and see when who is in the upper hand, in any case not the east wind over the west wind over the east wind.
Because of Yang's lack of people, such a large southern province, although the main positions are controlled by the people, but the secondary positions are almost taken by the people of Blue玉门.
No but other mountains, Zhenhaishan presently face this situation, Qin Wei also faces the people below the Blue玉门阳阴违, just because Qin Wei is Yang Qing's working daughter, under her direct control of the Blue玉门 disciple is not afraid to tell Qin Wei how much to give Yang Qing face now.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
All nine of the masters sent a complaint, resulting in the worst of the the masters, instead sent the only good news.
Only one of the Master of the Cave was able to kill a disciple of the three of the White Lotus, which would have caused a stir between the Blue Lotus and Yang Qing.
The Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue
Seeing this good news, Qin Wei was not happy at all, but filled with suspicion, the bastard has just gone, only in the middle of the evening, can the whole East come hole to manage a barrel of iron?
In particular, the disciples of the Blue Temple tightly united in the side of the master of the
Are you kidding?
What is it? Is it foolish to beat the faces of the other nine masters, or to beat the faces of her mountain master, Qin Wei?
Their testimony can't be faked!
Isn't the man called Song really so evil?
But how evil can this be that all the disciples of the Blue Temple are blind?
Qin Wei shook his head slightly, and felt not right, that Song, even worse, the disciples of the Blue Temple can not condemn each on the playing table, the expression supports Miaodong.
The bastard has just gone, and so low, why so great prestige?
If you say something like Wang's shock, you don't believe in killing Qin Wei.
Red cotton and green willows, too, with a look of uncertainty.
Don't wash, don't wash your clothes, and bring me that letter!
Qin Wei stood up from the water, the shore, the sheep fat burst out a mist, the surface of the pearl instantly disappeared.
The two waitresses immediately helped her to dress in socks, a set of hair, six snow-white jackets inserted into the butterfly-like locks of the hair on the back of her head.
In the Great Hall, the face cold mountain lord Qin Wei high sit on.
However, no matter what Qin asked, he was convinced that Song did not obey the orders of the lord of the cave, so that the mountain gate was destroyed, and that the lord of the cave was not respectful, and that the lord of the cave was killed to watch.
Qin Wei did not need to have too much doubt about the possibility of not killing the monastery of the three monasteries of the White Lotus, also seen in the Battle of Floating Cave, and later heard about the monastery of the two monasteries of the three monasteries of the White Lotus died, and the one who completed the task came back, so it is possible to say that the monastery of the three monasteries of the White Lotus killed a Song Fu.
But she's not a fool, so easy to let all the Dong Blue Temple disciples follow on the table to help Miao to get rid of the responsibility?
Simply, you're sure there's nothing to hide from me?
The bottom people don't know the top struggle, the only meaning is to know that they themselves participated in the killing of Song, once admitted, do not say that the side of the east come to the hole can not tolerate themselves, the Blue Gate people have to retaliate themselves, and more to do with the doubling of the power of the pearl.
So killing can't be the truth, it's just one bite, it makes Qin Wei a little uncomfortable, it feels like Dong Dong is really being handled by the fuckin' between a dinner and a barrel of iron.
You can't just say good luck to that bastard who just hit a whole bunch of dead people?
CHAPTER 78

As soon as the word went out, the red cotton asked, "Lord of the mountains, is this to be reported to the lord of the province?"
"Now that's not clear, how do you get me to stuff the papers?
Qin Wei shook his head and immediately let the green leave to pass on a disciple of the Blue Temple.
After a disciple of the Blue Temple entered to see the lord of the mountain, Qin Wei asked: "Your neighbor Song, can you know?
"Song" ""Song" ""Song" ""Song" """Song"" ""Song"" ""Song"" ""Song"" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song"""" ""Song""" """Song""""""""Song"""""""""Song""""""""""Song""""""""""Song""""""
Qin asked: "How does Song help his people?"
Once again, I don't know why the mountain master asked this, but naturally hold the boxing saying: "Song master brother is for people stubborn and simple, the respectful master reassures, the personality is indisputable!"
He doesn't care what happened to Song and doesn't care whether his relationship with Song is good or bad, but when facing strangers, the same door is to maintain the same door, and in the case of uncertainty, saying good things is definitely right.
Qin waved his hand and pointed at the figure who had left the door, and said to the red cotton and the green lily standing on the left and right: See? That is what the master brother should say, and certainly not like all the people who come to Dongdong, that is not common sense!
"What do you want to do, Lord?"
Qin stood up and said,Hearing is false, seeing is true, I will go to Dong to see for myself, to see if the people of Dong Dong are really so enthusiastic about our great, small-sized lord!
Greenwood tried to ask,If they really love?
"It's not possible," said Qin, "but there must be a ghost in there, and if I'd really taken it, I'd have my lord's seat given to him."
If he can endure this, let him deal with the disciples of the Blue Temple of Zhenhaishan, and let the lord spare more of his mind!
Red and Green Liang looked at each other and knew that the mountain lord was saying something that could not be true, but as soon as they had been appointed, you had to go down and check, and it seemed a little...
It wasn't long before the simple meaning of the reply was finally able to go back to the East.
Nevertheless, he did not relax, but instead hesitated all the way, because the mountain lord Qin Wei led several people along with him!The mountain lord had just been appointed, and invited the mountain lord, Oh!
It's hard for some thieves to get on the boat! Though there might be holes everywhere, there might be leaks everywhere, but the people who got on the boat had to work together hard to get on the boat, and if they didn't get on the boat, they would be drowned, and there would be a line of life to get on the boat.
Miaoyi also doesn't know what's wrong between Yang and Blue玉门, the bottom person is in this state, can't do anything, and moreover he has just surrendered Yang Yang not long, inside information doesn't know much.
Standing in his position, I am the legitimate owner of the Eastern Cave, the Eastern Cave man is natural to listen to me, not listen to the words I am natural to settle the horse, is it not possible to drag it down slowly?
Who knew that he could handle the whole east entrance with the quickness of not covering his ears, but that he had made it to the top.
But I don't know the benefits of the unknown, at least for a while.
Meanwhile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zhu's watch is still a hog, you don't speak, he basically doesn't speak, and occasionally does not like to take a shit, only knows hand to hand sword follow, like a guard follow.
Miaoyi brought him out as a guard, and there was a monk with three white leaves who could withstand anything.
There was a red building in front of the road, and people gathered, and surrounded a large group of people, and I don't know which house the girls were throwing embroidery balls, and attracted the passing Mia Yi and Zhu Ten watch more eyes, but did not stay.
The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House
At this time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides, there were guards behind, and at a glance it was a person of identity.
As soon as she bit her teeth, her two arms pushed the embroidery ball past, and her hand was strong and balanced, and she was not to be the master of embroidery balls, if she hadn't practiced two times, then throwing a bad old head would not have been a big problem.
As soon as the embroidery ball flew, the crowd under the embroidery building stretched out their arms, but saw it flew from the top.
Their eyes looked forward, waving their hands, the embroidery ball hit again flies back to the embroidery building.
Zhu's watch was only a glance, and silently followed behind Miao, wagging shoulders with the crowd this side.
The girl staring at the embroidery with the flying embroidery, looking at the two embroiderers, the silver teeth slowly bite the lips, to the daughter's family, the face was lost, the embroidery thrown out was thrown back, it was unheard of.
The people under the embroidery floor were astonished, and each of them, with their pews, sent the two away, and then turned back and shouted, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss
The lady bit her teeth and went away, and disappeared into the embroidery building.
Inside the city, there is a river crossing, Zhu Tian table to the shore of the bow to ask the price of the boat, and with the Miaoyi twin to the tent small boat.
Their companions waved and carried them along the river.
Zhu holds his sword behind.
As the caravan went, a sounded on the shore, and the man looked back, and saw only the embroiderer's maid, with her horses chased by several great men.
"Sit for me," said the young woman, pointing at the head of the ship.
He looked around, while no one noticed, he tried to illuminate the flower illusion to the other, trying to make the other know hard to turn back.
Who knows the other still chase the horse, is not afraid of the fairy?
This man is now addicted to this thing, for no reason, to make it too low, when the master is also afraid that others will not see, just hide the illusion of the flower of the eye of the heart table, so that no one will see good laugh.
Only thermal transmission indicated the lower thermal.
Zhu looked back coldly at the lady, the illusion of the eye of the flower revealed, suddenly astonished the lady and others, stopped the horse not to make the next.
Miss Harun wakes up, understands why the other does not respect himself, feels the difference between the two, abnormally grieved to bite the lips...
For Seung, this is just a little interlude.
CHAPTER 79
On both sides of the small river, Yang, you can see a woman squatting on the shore washing her dishes.
There was also a blue building, where the girls waved their palms, and with their soft voices, looked at the branches of the exhibition, and invited the tourists who stood by the ship.
Again, on the banks of the river, the princes accompanied, singing, trying to attract a crowd of three, two, three, two, but the girls, with their red faces, quietly peeked at the princes on the tent, standing on the ship's head, breathtaking.
On the flower boat, which washed itself with the cloak, the thick powder of the old whale also loudly invited the prince of the ship to drink the flower.

To live by water is the nature of man, by boat all the way, is to see all the prosperity of the east city.
The people of this world, though to spend three hours each day to contribute to their will, and to pay the tax, but also as a result of the guardian of the monks, to defeat the demons, to expel the demons, to keep the peace.
The Six Saints of heaven and earth are also able to accumulate as little as they can, and to seize as much of their will, or even if their power is stronger, they will not be able to take such a large place.
It was also because of the existence of these monks, the mighty of the government did not dare to overwhelm the believers, stirring up the adoption of the will, the monks would not let them first
Although the monks do not often appear as lords, they do indeed stabilize the order of the world.
Of course, not all people along the river side like ordinary people take out three hours every day to contribute to their will.
Therefore, as hard as hard, as well as the people of the heavens are not affected, some are busy and some are restless is the law of life in the world.
Nevertheless, for those who stand at the head of the cruise, this is their own territory, seeing under the jurisdiction of the believers live and play, fearing that at the end of the year will not be able to successfully pay the pledge of the Pearl can be temporarily dropped...
The darkness, riding the dragon rowing under the star moon, simply means a heart seven eight.
Looking ahead to the east to the cave, it means to the hard head accelerate to the top, a little behind Qin Wei, holding a fist, "The master, the subordinates immediately go to the cave to inform the master, let them meet the master, the driver."
He's actually trying to get people to read the news and get them to be psyched first.
Qin looked back at him cold hum: No.
Then he ordered the man who followed him, "Look at him, don't give him the chance to send a letter, I want to see what the east-east hole is doing!
With a glance, the two monks of the three varieties of white roses had come quickly, and had put him in the middle.
Five men, in the moon, came straight east to the gate of the cave, and the speed was as rapid as the lightning.
The merchant who guarded the gate came out of the darkness and stopped in the middle of the mountain gate.
The sounded back and again to the others in the cave.
As soon as the news came out, the people in their respective training homes quickly flew away to the "Long Valley," six shadowmen carrying weapons, riding with the speed of six lions to prepare for uncertainty.
Qin Wei, not so much as to do the wrong thing to hit the mountain gate, has raised his hand to stop the people behind him, with the five people he leads urgently to sit under the donkey, to stop in front of the mountain gate, in exchange for the ordinary people must instantly throw out.
Only on the other side of the mountain gate was there a quick gathering of six cows.
Qin was a little surprised, didn't think the reaction of the East came so fast, this efficiency is unusual.
That's what Mia said before, that if the mountain gate were to be broken again, we'd have to look for the prince's account.
Miao also said, I don't listen to, when I wish I didn't give a pear, I still have to go!
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
Seeing is the mountain lord Qin Wei, the storekeeper came again immediately shut up, hold the fist.
Immediately came to the uncertain Yan Shu and others face to face, also quickly turned off the ride, quickly walked to the mountain gate, hugged and greeted.
Many glanced at the simple meaning of accompanying Qin Wei, seeming to blame the lord of the mountain why not come early to greet.
Some even questioned the meaning in the dark.
However, it is a painful word, and both have made preparations to prevent him from broadcasting, and to interfere in front of him.
Qin, looking up at the mountain gate, hum, "This place is better than the southern province! "
Everyone heard that was not good, and didn't know what to say.
Qin wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi
Uniformity is trapped behind Qin Wei entered the Great Hall.
There was nobody in the hall, and Qin Wei went straight to the hall where the lord of the cave lived.
The black coal in the back of the yard was lying at the door of the one who loosely tail, the tail from time to time clattered on the ground gently, as soon as the open eyes see Qin Wei immediately two eyes flipped up, seemingly a little unknown where to hide.
Under pressure, black coal jumped several hundred meters high, fell outside the house, hurried to escape.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
She didn't like black charcoal, but she didn't even go to her own house at night, to kill herself on her own horse, to do such a small thing, she couldn't have lost that face.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
Qin, who came out of the room, looked around, saw the lights on the one side of the chamber, and immediately went away, 'Bang' a foot opened the door.
As a result, two beautiful maids dressed in blasphemy shouted, crowded together, looking inside Qin Wei shivered.
Obviously, living in the owner's back house, must be a swift waiter.
Qin Wei looked at the waiter who was behind, and looked at the irony, as if to say, look, the men are all the way.
Red cotton smiled, this time only she followed, green herb did not come.
There were no shadows of the brave in the room. Qin Wei looked at the two frightened little girls coldly and asked, "Where are your masters gone?"
The two little girls shook their heads.
Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus
It's true! Yan, one of the people outside the large hall, ran into the room straight away, wagging his head.
CHAPTER EIGHT
Qin asked,Where is Xi?
Yan smiled, "The cave master has visited the territory.
Qin and Wei, finding that guy really reassuring about the home, just come and dare to throw the thing of the cave out to visit.
Ask again, When will he come back?
This............
Qin whispered: Then bring him back to me at once.
Yan suddenly wanted to cry without tears, "The lord of the mountain, the whole of the eastern cave is so big..."
I didn't dare to say that big place where you let us go to find him!
Qin Wei thought it seemed to be a bit of trouble for the people, did not correct on this matter, began to call in each person to ask the Song was killed, what happened to the condemnation on the table.
"Are you threatened by any means?"
"Why did the lord of the mountains say this? The lord of the caves never threatened us, only hated the Song, and I could not see down, even though I was at the same gate."
It's no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
There were obviously cats in there, but these people, whether they were Yan Shu and others who were sent by themselves, or the people of the Blue Gate, were held together like iron buckets, and they were neither dead nor free.
Qin Wei is ready to return to calculate.
Nao has been waiting for three days and has no idea when the guy will come back.
What made her unspoken was that even if the owner of the cave was not there, a group of subordinates would keep the affair of the cave in order.
Other disciples of the Blue Temple were not willing to guard the mountains and to deal with things, and were not seen in the Eastern Cave, on the contrary, Yan Shu and others of the swift and devoted followers did not have to do this, all of the disciples of the Blue Blue Temple were doing their duties faithfully.
Moreover, the Prince and others to Yan's attitude is obviously very courteous, thus can be seen to the attitude to Miao Daidong master.
Look at the lord of the great cave, and in the middle of the evening he will give to the east the cave, and in the eyes of the governor there will be great glory.
Whoever appoints himself is unable to deal with each hole, and whoever is unwilling to appoint is unable to deal with each hole, and whoever is unwilling to appoint is unable to deal with each hole, and whoever is unwilling to appoint is unable to deal with each hole.
Didn't heal the old blood of the silent Qin Wei? Didn't he measure the king's belly with the heart of a small man?
It's autumn, and she can't stay here forever, and the ghost knows when Miao will come back.
After three days, finally took the people away, did not know what she wanted to do, in any case, to take the meaning also.
You've got to go to the front of the mountain gate, Yan, and others in the hearts of seven to eight, each to the simple meaning, to look at, you've got to get over!
It was clear to all of us that if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren
Yan and others killed the Blue Temple disciples.
But the people of the Blue Gate are waiting to do the thing of betraying the master.
Now there is this quiet, the people of the Blue Gate are both afraid and regret, regret how in the beginning on the steamer boat, to face Qin Wei Xu is not afraid to take the boat, and to do all the hard work with all the people everywhere leaking water eyes to see the steamer boat will sink not return to the shore.
Qin, who noticed the expressions of all, with a cold face, the more sure there was a ghost.
The waiter, glancing at the master, could not help laughing, thinking that no matter what cats were, they could hold together, and it was clear that the owner of the mine had made the people fit for the purpose, and it was no wonder that at first the people would dare to throw things into the mine, no matter how far they ran, the other mines had mainly this ability, and the towns and mountains were done.
I don't know what the mountain lord says, if the mountain lord really gets the support of the command, the mountain lord's position let the mountain lord sit is really...
Qin Wei obviously saw her thoughts, gave her a glance, saying angry thing can be true?
Qin Wei did not stop, after asking if there was anything important, and with a single meaning directly to the southern province.
Young's closest relatives just took office and killed the Blue Temple disciples, it is not possible to conceal this, it will be revealed soon, the Blue Blue Temple whether or not to react, at least to ask, Qin Wei must personally reveal the details, so that Yang Qing has a number in mind before.
Knowing I'm going to Nan Province, I'm a little confused, I don't think it's necessary anymore.
People at the bottom don't know what's at the top, and the dark angle involved is complicated, and if they do, they don't have the courage to do it at first.
After arriving at Nan Province, Qin Wei met Yang Qing did not need to inform.
Following Qingqing to the highest pavilion in the back of the mountain, saw Yang is sitting to refine.
Qin Wei, in a white dress like snow, said.
In the case of others, Qin Wei has always maintained the up and down of Yang Qing, only in the very private case to call 'Father'.
After finishing his work, he opened his eyes and threw out a wishful blossom the size of a quail in his mouth, and smiled, "How did you come?
He got up and sat down by the side of the tea, stretched out his hand, and indicated to sit down and speak.
Qin Wei sat on the other side of the tea, "Lord, the lord of the east to the south is afraid to cause you trouble.
Yang said, "Oh," with a little frowning, "What's the matter with him?"
"The lord oversees himself," said Qin, placing before him a box with a musical instrument.
After Yang opened, too, was confused.
With a glance at Zing and Zhong, Yang quickly re-examined a copy of the warrant again.
He was a man who was able to do things. He was not as astonished as Qin Wei was at first, but rather astonished.
"I don't know what's going on," he said. "I ran to the east to see what was going on, and the young man went out and toured the territory..."
Qin Wei gave a detailed account of what she had seen.
After listening, Yang touched the table gently, pondered for a long time, shaking his head, also unable to, finally voiced, "The man who brought you here, I ask myself.
Simplification was soon summoned, for the first time face to face with Yang such high up person, plus the soul of a ghost, this guy nervous can not.
But one thing he did, depending on what Yang asked, he still repeated the old saying.
Yang didn't turn around like Qin Wei asked, rose slowly to the bar of the pavilion, looked at the distant mountain view, one hand slowly back, face no expression, calmly said: drag out, cut!
Zhao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chapter 81
It's not a joke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Qin took a glance at the simple meaning of being dragged away, without saying anything, Mia after all is Yang Qing the person, she does not give the face of Mia also give the face of Yang Qing, it is not good to do without any evidence of the abuse of the hand of Mia Mia, but Yang Qing can do, did and no one can say.
He wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He knew Yang might be frightened of himself, mainly to ask for the inside, but he knew more Yang Yang had spoken out, and if he didn't give Yang Yang a satisfactory answer, Yang Yang wouldn't have changed his mind for himself the shrimp, and killed himself for no reason to others.
"Lord, I am wrong," I said, "please give me another chance, Lord," I said, "I said..."
Their faces were white as they struggled to beg forgiveness.
Yang's head, looking at the distant mountains, didn't return, just released a hand from behind, and lifted it a little.
A glance, the two loosened a single meaning.
The uncertain sense of panic, crashed into the pavilion, kneeled behind Yang, and said with a pale face, "Lord, I say!"
Yang asked quietly, "Why are the people of the Blue Gate on the table condemning Song?"
"It's all done by the owner...
He's been pushed!
After the most difficult to say this word, the simplicity face of bitterness, if after this thing the sleek is still the master of Dong Dong, in the future Dong Dong is afraid not to tolerate itself.
Plum and Chrysanthemum listen.
Qin Wei's eyes flicker, is the end of the mystery to be revealed?
Anyone can guess what kind of pressure must have been on the people of the Blue Gate, but does not know what kind of means of suppression has been used.
"Before," said Yang, "because of the consequences."
Despite his calmness, he put a great deal of pressure on him, because he understands that if he hears something wrong, he will be able to decide his life or his death in a moment, and he will not have any chance of rebelling.
"Lord, it is true that the disciples of the Blue Temple did not listen to the orders of the ruler before the lord of the Miao-dong came to the east, and instead they went to and to and to, and to and to, and to and to, and to and to, and to and to, and to and to.
On that day, as soon as I came east to the gate of the cave, I saw no one guarding the gate of the cave, and I was filled with anger.
Simply puts things through fifteen or ten years of truth.
As soon as the three heard of Yan, they rushed to the front of the mountain gate, and they were angry at why no one looked after the mountain gate, and Yan Yan did not complain about the blue jade.
Blue Gate Song and others come late, and also speak of shyness.
Hearing this, Yang, who was looking back at the people, had squinted a little, had squinted a little in the seams of his eyes, and he was the one who sent him, and everyone knew that he was his friend, and even his friend had been appointed.
"What did your cave owners do then?" asked Yang.
"Then the master didn't say two words, directly drinking orders, immediately go to Zhenhaishan to report to the master, saying the blue jade turned, scared the blue jade disciples one jump, a group of people so hard to see the young master, the result is that the young master didn't give the face, on the spot drinking to white linen repaired Song Fu watch over the mountain gate, even though Song Fu refused to answer, and directly drive the wolf to them crashed past!"
With a smile on his back, he could imagine what he was at that time, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was
"What about the back? How did the back of Song help to kill?" asked Yang.
"In fact, Song was not killed by the lord of the cave, but by his subordinates, Yan, and by the Cheu Shao group together..."
To this point, simplicity will not hide any more, continue to speak.
Saying that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that was that that that that that that was that that was that that was that that was that, that that that was that, that that that was that, that that was that, that that was that, that that was that, that that was that, that that was that, that that was that, that that was that, that that was that, that was that, that that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that,
In the after, the Cheu Shao group smashed the mountain gates, stirred up the quiet, and the Miaoyi excuse jumped, while searching for the enemy to disperse the disciples of the Blue Temple, called Song Fu to the east to the Great Hall to question the sin, Song Fu did not confess, the long-planned Yan Shu, Uniformity and the Cheu Shao group had sneaked back, with the Miaoyi order, the three joined up, and the Song Fu to be executed inside the Great Hall.
Afterwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After that is what happened.
When they looked at each other, they found that the lord of the mine was a very small man, and that it was not enough for him to be wise, and that when he had come to the mine in a few days, he had given the whole of the mine to the fire, and that was a good thing.
Qin Wei's silver teeth bit the red lips, and the riddle is clear, she now rather had a sense of the earlier than not to be clear, and listened to the little boy play the wind, it seems that the whole town Haishan the guy is able to endure, to make her heart very uncomfortable.
Yang closed his eyes for a moment, then slowly turned around and looked down on the knee and said, "Arise!
"Thank you," he said, "I don't know what's going to happen next."
Who knows Yang didn't blame him, but said, Don't let anybody know what you say today, you'll never have anything happened, and nobody will investigate what happened to you, and what will happen to you in the future, I promise you to report directly to the lord of the town Haishan, do you understand what I mean?
As soon as he was surprised, he understood what Yang meant by saying to himself that he would not go out and that he himself had designated himself as the east entrance to the cave, indicating that he had entered Yang Yang's law eye, he did not think that bad had turned into good.
Understand Understand Understand Understand!
The shock was so great that it almost made him turn.
Chapter 82
"Thank you," said Yang with a smile.
Immediately a pale blooming soft and faint pearl of rice emerged from the watch.
"Thank you, thank you!"
"Come back!" said Yang.
After a long walk down the mountain, Yang ha smiled two voices, shaking his head, "When he was on the job, he sneaked into his mountain door, thanks to the little boy thought out, really dare to do.
A::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Before I let him sit down in the east of the town just to see how many people will listen to my words in the southern province, can I say a word nine, not in the spirit of use, just to see who will jump out and stop, really put him in the east of the town I was a little worried that it was right or wrong, now it seems that little boy was capable, but I was worried.
A glance at Zhou and Zhou Qiu, all saw Yang's more and more appreciation of Zhou Yi, as soon as the time is sure to be reused, as the two of the maid's hearts also counted, afterwards to the master of Zhoudong not too lively.
Qin left her mouth and looked a little uncomfortable.
Who knows Yang has smiled to look at the name, asked, Wei, I kiss you the Eastern Cave Cave Lord did not look away?
He knew, of course, that was not the right thing to do with his daughter.
Qin, however, did not like to hear this, rising to his side, said not well: "He is playing now, I see that he can not be so painful as now, when he is behind to bring out the wishes of the pearl to fulfil the commitments of the opponent!
Yang, laughing, pointed at her and shook his head, "You! You! You, the man who gave you a kiss for your father, don't you see the eyes like this?
Don't you think of all those who are held by him, who have done anything to betray the Master, and who dare to betray him even after he has fulfilled his promises?
Qin Wei wasted no words!
Yang went back and sat down, signing, "If there were more talents like that little boy in my southern province, Blue Temple would not be concerned, and the southern province would do well."
Qin said with a frown, "Lord, do you not feel that little man is too deep in his heart after this?
Yang shook his head: "If you were serious, you wouldn't have trouble hitting the door straight away. Instead, you would communicate well with yourself, arrange the way back, and not take responsibility afterwards. He did this to show that he took it for granted to do this, and then run out as if nothing happened.
Qin didn't feel any better, she whispered.I don't think that guy is any kind of shame, just that you appreciate him, and look at him.
"It doesn't matter whether you look at him or I don't like him.
I have sent him to remove the ghosts in the territory of Longfeng, the two monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of
Qin Weimer didn't say anything, she knew Yang was right, but she couldn't deny her reluctance to be shy, just look at the guy is not cool!
Knowing a woman is not a father!While looking, Yang Qian shook his head, knowing that sometimes it is difficult to turn the mind of a daughter, this thing does not demand...
The port of the east city, look at the blue sea, the high sea wide, the seagull flies over.
It took him a few days to walk around and quietly returned to the city to see Xiang, then to the place where he first crossed the sea and landed.
The docks are still busy, with all kinds of goods unloaded from fishing boats, and also with long-distance sailing boats by the shore.
After questioning people everywhere, Miao and Zhu Tian left once again.
After a few days of touring, there was a number of things in the mind of the eastern city, the two of them came out of the dock, and smiled, "The Shun Shun is a good city lord, it seems not to have to change people.
Zhu immediately accepted: "The master is wise!"
................................................................................................... 
They were riding along the coast. They had been on the island for ten years. They had a good understanding of the sea.
Arriving at a rocky area, two stop, Seung Yi turned down the horse, flew over the rock to look around the terrain.
Zhu came near him and asked,What is the master looking at?
"I've heard there's a seafarer that can go far without a man," he said.
"Yes."
"It's not going to work for the monks who can fly above the Red Lotus," he explained.
Is it difficult to build
"It's not difficult," he said. "It's nothing different from the appearance of a normal seafarer," he said. "It's that the stern has more propeller blades made by craftsmen, that the propellers are connected to drive the front, that the propellers can be driven on condition, and that the horsepower of the legs can be driven on condition by running on the wheels of the stern, and that the speed is much faster than the speed of a normal power ship.
What are you asking for?
Say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zhu clapped: The master is wise!
"I-"You don't ask what I want to do, just say,"I'm smart.
But if you think there's really no common language with this guy, it's lazy to say anything about the cow's drums, and the silver gun flashed on the reef, stamped, waved, "I've been out for a few days, I've got to see it, I've got to see it, go back!
CHAPTER 83
As it was seen, the prince was very careful of the same gate, and the four brethren and sisters of the two of the whites were in turn guarding the mountain gate.
Today's watch is Nan, Seung Yi and Zhu Tian watch under the mountain gate board.
"Lord, you are here. Everyone is waiting for you to come."
Nan thought of the reins of the two, and went back immediately and shouted, "The master is back.
He looked at Nan, and smiled into the mountain. He didn't think that everyone would think of him, and he thought Nan Nan was making a joke.
Before the people reached the Great Hall, they saw the cave from flying, and each of them said, "The master of the cave is back.
With a handful of people entered the Great Hall, and sat down alone on the high rise, and asked, "Isn't it all right these days I've been gone?
It's all wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong
"What's going on? Everyone's not doing well.What's going on?"
Yan, calmly, said with his arm, "The lord of the cave, the next day when you went, the lord of the mountains, Qin Wei, led the people, to ask what happened to Song's death.
As soon as he mentioned the woman, a dark face.
It's not because of Song's death, it's because she's just been appointed, and the woman runs to check her back, what does that mean?
Miao looked at the people, coldly hummed: Didn't the bitch mean to get in trouble?
Ben's face was still worried, and all of them stared at him, and all of them raised their thumbs in their hearts, and the lord of the cave, your cattle, dare to be the daughter of the lord of the temple, and the lord of the mountain of the town is a bitch!
C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C
Prince Fa and others secretly exchanged eyes, it seems the relationship between the lord of the cave and the lord of Yang Qing is not as everyone imagines, it seems to be a deep resentment, even Yang Qing's daughter has cursed the bitch, the relationship can be seen how.
Many of the people who joined Yang's command, many of whom came with tasks, it is not possible to really listen to Yang, the people who were seized by the sleight of hand, and feared how to fool the master, now it seems that the master of the sleight of hand can secretly seek to come to the side of the Blue Temple, if he can turn Yang Yang's family letter into the Blue Temple hanging on the dark pillar beside Yang, the master side of the Temple can also exchange, it is not certain or a work.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
What's the big thing, as long as you can control the mouth of the Blue Gate, as long as the facts let Qin Wei know what's going to happen? He doesn't believe Yang Qing just lifted himself up, turns back and gives himself away because of the thing, doesn't it not blow his face, say he doesn't know people?
He didn't believe that Yang could do anything to damage his lord's reputation, and said, Didn't he do anything wrong?
"You don't want to say anything," said Mr.
"We're keeping our mouths like bottles, but the key is that the word is taken away by the lord of the mountain, and he doesn't know if the word can get over.
"You don't have to worry about this. I'm sure that's not what you're talking about.
He didn't say anything in his heart, to kill Song Fu has a single meaning, a single meaning can easily open to doubt.
In fact, seemingly more calm Yan and Cheu Shao group also think like this.
As soon as the sounded, there was a sneaking sound of wolf's feet.
They waited a little, and when they saw what had just been said, they hurried into the palace, and bowed their hands to the people with a trembling spirit, and then went in and said, "Lord of the cave!"
Without waiting for the word, the people had passed by, asking with seven mouths and eight tongues whether he had been taken away by the lord of the mountains.
With Yang's words at the end, the simple meaning is to take the chest to ensure that you absolutely do not sell to everyone.
With this, all at once great breath, each clapping his shoulder, saying that he is enough.
Gao sits on the sleek listens to the word is also glad, raised the throat, in the heart of glory, the east come to the end of my control!
Don't all be happy too early, don't you know Zheng Jin?
"Of course," said the Prince, "he is our brother, and he entered the school earlier than the brother of Song."
Everybody wondered why he had to mention Chenglong, and simply pointed out to the outside: "He is with me, and now he is waiting outside for the summons of the Lord of the Caverns!"
When all of them felt strange, the Prince immediately asked,Why is the Master Cheng here?
"Although I had enough of the interrogation, I gave you blue jade over the table, as if one of your masters, who was in charge of coordinating the residence of Nan Xuan, had spoken to the lord himself, saying that Song had no right to die, and asked the lord to agree to send another blue jade over Song's shortage, so that he could redeem his sins, and Zheng Jinlong came with me.
Gentlemen, it seems to you that is a matter of doubt. On the way, Zheng Jinlong knocked on my side, and said, It is better for all of you to have a heart.
Afterwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gao, who sits above, nodded, and asked the people, How do you see this?
After everyone's eyes exchanged, Prince Fa's face grimly said: "The master of the cave, the brother Zheng came only to fear that it is the same as the expression said, is aimed at the death of the brother Song.
"Your Blue Gate people are not finished, and they are looking for our truth, and if he is not faithful, you come together, and do to him, and we are not afraid of him.
Yes, what did he do?
Their faces were changed, and the Prince made a gesture: No, Lord, if we kill the Master Cheng again, the trouble will be great.
Zheng is easy to kill, but what after the death of Zheng? What shall we do if every one of the gates sends another disciple who has been trained by Qing Lin?
As the so-called bystanders, Yan, and Cheu Shao group, look at one another, the spirit of a slight twitch, the master of the cave is in the business of killing the disciples of the disciple of the disciple of the disciple of the disciple of the disciple of the disciple of the disciple.
CHAPTER 84
"You can't go left," said Mr.
Prince Fa took a fist and said, Master, I have a way of bringing Master Cheng into our camp, but I need Master to do for me one thing.
Is This Is Is Is Is Is Is This Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is
The Lord, if the Lord, in the allocation of the wishes, can make the Master enjoy the same treatment as we, there is a way to persuade the Master Master.
Many people frown and quickly observed the shy reaction, because this requirement is a little excessive, all the wishes pearl divided by one, there would have been three left to the master of the cave, if there were three more to Zheng Jinlong, then the master of the cave is not one no?
Indeed, hesit, and leaned a little forward, Are you kidding, Prince, that I, the lord of the cave, am not dead when you have taken away all the wishes?
I tell you, at the end of the year, twenty-four wishes for the wishes of the wishes of the wishes of the wishes of the wishes of the wishes of the wishes of the wishes of the wishes.
You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He's not afraid of anything. He's not afraid of anything. He's not afraid of anything. He's not afraid of anything. He's afraid of anything.
"Don't misunderstand me," said the prince.
"What do you mean?"
Everybody looked at the Prince tried to ask: "Isn't the Lord saying that there is another source of wishful beads? I mean, that when the other sources of wishful beads have been found in the hands of some of my brothers and sisters, the Lord will not be too late for them to be repaired."
As soon as this came to pass, the merchants came again, and the faces of the three kings changed suddenly, not to say, that they were not able to fit into the three masters' brothers, the masters and sisters of the two masters' brothers and sisters of the three masters' brothers and sisters.
Most importantly, the master's so-called wish beads other sources are only on the mouth, everyone has never seen, it is natural to get the benefits of the hand first to get the hand is the most stable, the next thing to say is clear.
But all the princes opened their mouths, and they could not, neither could they, put it in their hearts.
Nancy was outside guarding the mountains without knowing what was going on inside the palace, or she would have been unhappy.
That's it!Your fingers whipped against his arm, and he thought for a while, then he pointed to his head, "You can promise, but when it's time to make other money, you can't shrink, you have to go with me!
Yan's heart suddenly, what flashed in his mind, the master of the cave doesn't really want to hunt the starry sea?
"It's natural," said the prince, "I'll follow the master's orders as long as I'm here."
He didn't say he's dead, but if you're the cave master, we're going to follow you!
He smiled and looked at the other disciples of the Blue Temple.
Prince Fa looked back coldly at the masters and sisters, waiting for victory and others, though some reluctant, but still extruded a smile nod.
"All right," said Mia, clapping his hand, "it's all set, and that thing, Cheng-long, will be handed over to you at the same door to deal with.
Just let him in!
Simplicity took off, soon brought from outside a white fat blue man, always with a gentle smile, looked younger than Song.
The Prince and others shouted the voice brother.
Their arches indicated a circle, finally settled, smiling at the high rise, said: "My subordinate Zheng Jinlong ordered to come east to the cave, see the master of the cave!"
This man looks more than Song's morality, at least to make Seung-yi look not so reluctant, and reach out to help, "don't be too polite."
When asked a few questions, Zheng Jinlong has always maintained a respectful attitude and kept to his subordinates.
After a long conversation, as the people were leaving the hall of the parliament, Miaoyi suddenly said, "It is plain.
When he came to the door, he turned around and said, What does the lord of the cave say?
Slowly walking down the seat, Mia looked at him like laughing and laughing, "I really didn't say anything, bitch
So did the lord leave you?
One's heart, Thinking I didn't show any blossoms, a look of surprise: Killing Song is part of the subordinate, the subordinate says nothing good to the subordinate, is the master doubting the subordinate?
"No," he said. ""No," he said. """No,"""No,"""No,"""no,"""no,"""no,"""no,"""no,"""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"
In the backyard, eating full of black charcoal and not even active, still lying on the side of the door, rolling the snake's tail, swiftly entered the yard, it also just opened eyes to see, safe, not the woman with the knife on her ass, continue to nap.
Yan, who followed, tried to ask: "Lord, do you doubt the singularity of telling the truth?"
"No, I just think that bitch of Qin Wei won't talk so well, but that bitch has been looking for me.
Miao raised his hand, saying nothing.
Hearing the master came back, he looked at the thousands and the snow behind the two men.
As soon as he entered the room, the two waitresses immediately served the candy, and then silently stood around.
Miaoyi looked at the two, waved back to the two, he can't talk about any trust at the moment.
After the two went out, Mei said to Yan Shu: "I have a place by the sea, you go back to the east town, organize some workers..."
As soon as he spoke of the construction of the dock and the ship, Yan jumped at him with a sense of surprise: "Do you not really want to go hunting for the starships?
"You want more," he said. "I'll do it."
"Re-"
There is no shortage of civil servants, and that is what you have to do. I have been running for a few days, and I am going to wash and wash.
Yan, with only his shoulder, turned out of the hall, saw the thousands and the snow outside, and said with his mouth: "The cave is mainly bathing.
As he washed himself, he paused, reminding him, "All the east of the city, there is no chance of being a cave master's maid, and there is no chance of being a cave master's trusted maid, and there is no chance of staying for long..."
CHAPTER 85
The quiet young man just took off his clothes and buried them in thermal pools. He closed his eyes and enjoyed for a while. He heard the footsteps and opened his eyes to the stone room door.
As it turned out, anxious thousands and snow came in, both of them except for their clothes, only one chest on top, and a cage-sized short on the bottom.
Their shiny shoulders, their delicate claws, and their coriander-like limbs, their curved waist, were all exposed to the air.
Like two girls with shameful bones, dressed in scarce clothing, with red faces, carrying bath supplies came.
He opened his mouth, he was silent for a moment, and suddenly he thought of something, and his face was red, and he quickly reached for a garment on the shore, and pressed directly into the water to cover his throat, and he was nervous, and said, What are you two doing in here?
"Wait for the Lord's bath!" said the two men, with their faces red.
Miao tightly covered her lower body, and shook her head, No, I come myself.
This is what the slaves should do.
The two waitresses, remembering what had been said before, with their heads pressed down, stretched out their white legs to the bottom of the pond, and no matter whether Miaoyi agreed or disagreed, one reached out to help Miaoyi loose her hair, and one with a spoon to help Miaoyi wet her shoulders.
Mia is really embarrasment can not, even a little embarrasment to anger, however, some things are male nature.
The two girls had a little water, a light, half-transparent short dress, how to resist the wind of the spring water, if the water penetrated, and there was the body scent, so that the quickness of the heart instantly accelerated, did not dare to look further, to blow the two to the mouth and to swallow.
But hes not to look at the two want to hide the body, only to close the eyes, the hands tightened the panties, let the two gentle touch the body, the finger pointed over the skin feeling, let the feeling of uncontrollable a shiver.
However, gradually adapted, after adapting to feel unspeakable comfort, is that the two hands tightly cover the crotch always refuse to release.
Knowing that is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thermal Environment on thermal side of the town is not too bad.
Blue Mountains like dreams, between mountains stone tracks, there are flying birds and beasts, a group of people, turning wonders, viewing the forest sea, listening to the spring water.
A group of brothers and sisters, such as the Prince, led the brother Zheng to admire the scenery of Dong Dong, familiar with the environment of Dong Dong, each to respect the brother.
"The six holy places under its jurisdiction, and the heavens and the earth, and it is a good place!"
Several people entered into a pavilion, listening to the teacher introduced Zheng Jinlong around the beauty of the heart feeling that the mountain scene of the district to the east of the cave is not any better than the Hall Blue Temple.
There was always a gentle smile on his face.
The Prince, accompanied by a smile, "Now I have the Blue Gate, too, and there is much to be done!
"Oh," said Chenglong, "do you have a teacher in your eyes?"
As soon as this was said, the smiles on the faces of all suddenly, the atmosphere suddenly became embarrasment, the thought that should come at last.
"It scares me," he said.
Before Prince Fan's words were finished, Zheng Jin-hongren turned and interrupted, still smiling, but in the tone of Morson's coldness, "Are you afraid? Don't you think your courage is too great?
All the others' eyes fell on Prince's face, because he said there was a way.
Prince Faw looked surprised: How do you say this?
Zheng grinned,Teacher, are you fooling me?Teacher Song's death, are you not prepared to give the teacher a turn?
Prince Fa looked quietly and said: "Song master almost ruined my blue jade good, Song should die! give us another chance, we will still do it!"
After a moment, Zheng said slowly, "Is there anything in there? Is there anyone who wishes to hear it?"
Prince Fa said in a low voice, Master, there are things that even if the Master does not say, in fact, everyone knows well, can I stay under the blue jade master, and will sooner or later take Yang Qing in place, said the Master or not?
Zheng asked whether it had anything to do with Song's brother's death.
Of course there is.
Prince Fan asked: "What do you think of this young man?"
Zheng Jin-don't quite understand what it means, hesitated, "The others don't know, but they know how to be low, and they can't get on the stage, and without Yang Qing, without today, it's not enough to say that Yang Qing's heart is not enough.
"Good-bye," said the Prince, "as the Master said, but the Master knows only one thing or two, the relationship between the Young and Yang Qian is not so close as the outsider can see, I waited for him to say something wrong, and to call Qin Wei a bitch!"
Zheng Jinlong naturally knows that Qin Wei is Yang's daughter, Mia Yi dare to curse the lord's daughter is a bitch?How strange is it?But what does this have to do with the death of Song's brother?
At once the Prince had his mouth on his ear, and he whispered a few words after he had altered the facts to a lesser extent.
"Three," said Zheng, "why did he give us so many wishes?"
"I'll see with my own eyes," he said, "when I see with my own eyes a wishful bead of wishfulness that gathers all the people a year."
"What else does he wish for the Pearl?"
"Now, brother, if you know our difficulties, and if you don't listen to me," said the Prince, "you are in a higher position than we are, but once the news has come to you, the little eastern cave will be hot, and the masters will surely send their own letters to our relatives to replace us.
Our loss is a small thing, but if the news is exposed, once Miaoyi is called back by Yang Qing, do we not want to lose the pain of finding the way to the master's school, so Song should die!
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
There were so many benefits, he himself wasted, and the disciples told themselves that they wanted to share a cup with everyone.
However, this has raised doubts about the Master, or else he will not send himself, said Cheng Jinlong, frowning, "Teachers, I can understand your bitterness for the Master Master, but you know that it is not possible to give the Master a reasonable explanation, what to teach me?"
CHAPTER 86
Prince Far, knowing that he was moved, was delighted, but on the surface he wondered, Did not the Master understand what I had said before?
Zheng Jianglong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's a lot to do with my Blue Gate, if you can turn Yang's heart into a dark pile that we'll put in Yang's neighborhood...
The Master thus explains the above to ease the doubt of the Master.
Zheng Kim Long paused and said that was what he wanted to do, but that was to become a grass on a rope, and that if something happened, they would not be able to jump, nor would they be able to run themselves.
After returning to his own training home, Zheng Jinlong hesitated and corrected, on the one hand the fearful consequence of angry masters, on the other hand the huge temptation of interests.
However, after a few days of observation and consideration, coupled with the prince and others continuing to encourage the temptation, Zheng Jinlong hardly wrote a secret play.
Theory also gives examples of a bunch of songs by the singer, saying that the singer should die no matter what the current situation.
However, after Sung's death, Prince Fa and others were very angry, and almost didn't tolerate a fight with S S.
However, inadvertently discovering that Mia was only on the surface courtesy of Yang Qing, in fact he was very dissatisfied with Yang Qing, and even on the back accused Yang Qing's working daughter of being a bitch.
Prince Fa and others are thinking for the big thing, and think that Blue玉门 and Yang Qing is not yet for a Song Roofing face, since Song Roofing is dead, can not be recovered, rather to the advantage, so Prince Fa and others decide to hold on to the matter, first to keep苗毅, to give苗毅 gratitude, strive to develop the heart of苗毅 as an embedded in the dark pile around Yang Qing, to wait for Blue Blue玉门 useful.
Moreover, it is easy to control, controlling苗毅 is equal to controlling Dong Dong, if for this to make苗毅 out Dong Dong, once Yang Qing sent a higher person to control, it is really inconvenient to Blue玉门 controlling Dong Dong.
Finally, Zheng said, He also thinks that the Prince and others are really good heart and suffering, please the masters to take into consideration!
In the court, Zheng Jin Long still a bit hesitant, wandering uncertain.
Finally a bite, throwing the eagle in hand into the air.
Fly away quickly..
As the saying goes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although hesit to control himself did not break that bottom line, after all the two were intimate skin in the most private circumstances, the first time with a woman so intimate, after all the feelings of the two have been different, the underlying consciousness of the two as their own, to wake up is also more casual.
Chi and Snow will no longer be so anxious in the face of the master of the cave, even remembering the first time the master of the cave washed, the master of the cave is even more shy and nervous than them, and the fairy is also shy!
Yan, who entered the back of the eastern palace, smiled, only to see in the pavilion, the snow ten fingers to the violin, in the beautiful sound of the violin, the thousands dancing, dancing beautifully as the fairy, and the Miaoyi squeezed a cup of tea to admire, the little days have been good.
Seeing Yan came in, Mia waved, thousand and snow stop.
Yan, walking into the pavilion, glanced at the two, and laughed, and asked, Master of the cave, these two can be used with satisfaction, and if not, I will let the master of the east town replace them with two.
Or for the reasons of the believer, Others may not be treated so well, once chosen, can not be replaced by, nor can any monk take all the women of the world as his own women of any use, if it is so, is it not for the world to revolt, but the master of the cave is a little special treatment.
It is only those under the Six Saints can enjoy the treatment of the maid of dress, and the monks outside the system can not enjoy the treatment, and the other monks go to the blue building is no problem, if they dare to attack the believers to destroy the balance of the believers to see, the monks within the system will mobilize horses to chase and kill, they will maintain their privileges!
This is one of the reasons why everyone wants to enter the system.
As soon as Yan said this, the thousands and the snow suddenly looked nervously at the young.
Before they were going to be the attendants of the fairies, the city of the east had spent a great deal of heart and blood to educate them, to eat and drink, and no one dare to sin them, because they were going to be the attendants of the fairies, sins are likely to be recompensed.
But if they were driven back, they would have fallen directly from heaven to the earth, without a fairy's background, and no one would have regarded them afterwards, and the consequences of being driven back would have been known, and it would certainly have been without a good fairy's service, and it would have been natural for some bloody people to be angry.
The two ladies looked at their eyes, thought of the condition of the skin in the water, and coughed, "Okay, with the hand, do not change.
He didn't want to be exposed to the embarrasment of bathing himself.
This means that the two ladies have passed the probation period, have been formally recognized, and their identity has changed instantly, and they have become officially the peers of the master of the cave, and no one can be guilty, even Yan Shu immediately faces the two ladies and says: "Aunt, Aunt!"
Even the fairies glorified themselves, and the two ladies saw with astonishment that the lord of the cave had officially acknowledged the two of them, and that from then on their status would be higher than that of many others, at least of those who were chosen together to serve the fairies as the fairies, for the two were the fairies of the lord of the cave.
Before the two didn't know that was the master of the cave. It's not anybody's luck, at least two out of 100,000.
Their eyes were different, and the two gently moved, and stood behind them.
Neither avoided the two, knowing that once the two were chosen, would start to let the two contact things, later would do things for themselves as Qingmei and Qingqiu for Yang, otherwise nothing can do anything.
"Do you have any reactions over there?" asked Zheng.
"There is no reaction at the moment, Zheng Jinlong has lived in his residence not out, Prince Fa they are very anxious, in constant urgency," Yan said.
CHAPTER 87
Just as the two were discussing, Zheng Jinlong, who was wandering in the yard and waiting for the news, paused, looked at the darkness that was passing through the air, and stretched out his arms to welcome.
After two days of flying, the flying eagles finally returned, and the cry fell on his arm.
Immediately a narrow jade was taken out of the eagle's tube for inspection.
Only see above written: Prince Law and others care and suffering, to cooperate!
This was the reply of the Blue Gate, Zheng Jinlong suddenly relaxed his mouth, did not know the attitude inside the gate, he did not dare to appear to the prince and others, betrayed himself, afraid to be caught up in the time, if the Blue Blue Golden Gate Gate had to seek the end, not he could not stop.
With the master's door passed, Zheng Jinlong also had confidence, quickly put the eagle into the eagle nest, turned back into the house, took off his blue coat, and changed into a black suit.
The Lord of East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East
Waiting for the black cloaked Zheng Jinlong to go out of the door, Prince Fa and others do not know where to flash out, and again in the old tone: "Teacher, what do you think?
They're worried too, if Zheng don't really cooperate, then they can only listen to sleek, join hands to get Zheng done.
Even though they knew that would be enough to stop their thirst, they could not do it.
"Because of your love for the school, I'm going to hang my head for you this time," said Zheng Jinlong, handing over the secret letter that he had just received to several people.
After a few had a look at the force in turn, one after the other was delighted, and at the indication of the prince, several stood in a line, and Qi arched hands, "There is a labourer brother!"
"I haven't seen the master for a few days, and I don't know if the the master has anything to send!"
After saying this, everyone knows that he has decided to share a cup, which is to let the master of the cave rest.
All of them immediately.
Themmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Tell them to come in!
Just after Yan Shu had spoken to the two ladies, the little aunt's snow with a little shaking, immediately walked to the door of the great hall, and summoned courage to the people who waited under the high stairs outside, "The master has asked you to enter the great hall.
His voice is not small, but it is clear that his voice is shaking, and it is clear that he is nervous, and it is understandable that he is so powerful for the first time in the face of a group of fairies.
When Zheng and others entered the Great Hall, Seong Yi saw the black clothes on him, understood that is Zheng Jin Long's attitude, smiled in his eyes, knowing that the man was also drawn to the water.
He looked at Prince, and immediately said to the voice, I've done it!
"Come to see the Lord!"
After all, the next person is ready to fight no one is afraid, to touch the four cloths of the monk can do one thing, Miaoyi smiled, "No more polite!
The Thous and The Snow sneaked a glance, and found that the master was a good man, and that so many fairies listened to him alone.In fact, there were nine below, plus one outside who guarded the mountain gate, and there were ten under, too many of whom could not afford to enter the cave.
But for the first two ladies, even one of the fairies was high in their minds, and more than ten, they had never seen so many fairies who had to be admired suddenly appear before them.
They don't know what to do if they know that their master is the worst of all the fairies.
After nine men stood in two rows, Zheng Jinlong once again went out to the arch and said: "When Zheng Jinlong came first, he hadn't done much for the east, and I don't know if the lord of the cave can send."
It's about showing you're willing to listen to the dispatch.
"The newcomer always has to show," said Mia with a smile. "How about a day at the mountain gate?"
After a while, let a monk, who had been made of three white roses, look at the gate, and come to this set again? Did not the lord of the cave, who had not yet understood the meaning, want to put a poison on Zheng Jinlong?
Zheng Jinlong also jumped, he was only the surface attitude, didn't think the other actually come, but thought that the person in the sight, although low, but the ability to kill the three monasteries of the White Lotus.
But soon I saw the master's intention is to see whether he really willing to accept the dispatch, people don't believe what is said, to put themselves into actual action to express.
"Do your duty," said Cheng.
Let's go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'll introduce you as soon as the people are almost there."
He lifted his fingers to the waiter, This is a thousand, This is a snow!
After everyone looked at each other, each holding a fist, "I have seen a great aunt, I have seen a little aunt!"
Chi and Snow in the tension of the two missing.
After a brief exchange of positions, Zheng Jinlong went to the mountain gates, and was alarmed by the right to guard the mountain gates of Wang Xiuchen, who dare to guard the mountain gates.
Hearing that was the meaning of the lord of the mountains, Wang Hidegan was able to let go, but in a low voice reminded: "Teacher, Song Teacher thing you know, too be careful.
Zheng nodded, on the surface, but in fact the heart tightened, or a little worried that the master of the cave will play.
Song-the last time the mountain gate was knocked, everyone is not stupid, after all, it is guessed that苗 is behind playing, in seeking excuses to jump.
So Zheng Jin decided today to protect the mountain gate and not to go, so as not to turn the boat in the ditch...
The news of Zheng Jinlong's humble surrender soon passed to Zhenhaishan, Qin Wei in a white suit like snow lying on a couch, looking at the secrets in his hand, a taste of thirst, the guy sent the Blue Gate to investigators to get it done, is the Blue Gate waste?
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye

Anyone who wants to find out the truth is true, but Yang agreed on the spot.
Afterwards Qin Wei asked Yang why agreed, what if to find out the truth?
Yang said, look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look
Thes soon moved to the South.
Or in the mountain pavilion, Yang, who got the secret, laughed, "One more fold in, this little boy is really to the east of the cave to operate into the bottomless cave, come one to swallow one!
A glance at the other side, the little boy again did not disappoint the lord, see the lord is more and more admiring him, the key is that the guy all the blue door fit the lord's appetite.
CHAPTER Eighty-eight Incubated Pluto Eggs (1)
Certainly Zheng Long's affair, Blue Gate is waiting to be handled, for the time being no concern, Mia finally can concentrate on the refinement.
But before that he had one more thing to do, which was to get to the bottom of the hole, to get to the bottom of the hole, and there was no time, and now there was time, and the last time that he had been with Old White in the red dust, he was going to try it out, as Old White said.
One day, just when it was dawning, Miao said to keep the thousands and the snow outside and not to let anyone in to disturb, and one hid in the quiet room to prepare, it was not possible, because the old man said that this secret must not be passed on!
As soon as the bulk of the eggs came out, the temperature in the room seemed to have fallen a little, the eggs in the hand were like holding the ice.
Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia
Carefully remove one of the eggs from the membrane, and place one hundred black eggs the size of quails on a plate.
Again, I felt a small knife in my hand, the blade was in my left hand, my right hand grasped the handle, and my left hand hand was bloody.
Old White told him to cover each egg with his own blood, to cover the egg with his own blood, and not to have any blanks, to separate the sex from the sex, and to let the egg in the place of birth feel his full breath.
After making every egg black, carefully confirming that there was no mistake, spread out the bound hair braid, hardened the hair from the head.
This is the secret of the old and the new, that the hair must be complete, not cut, and that the hair must have roots, and that the roots must not be cut, since they are to hatch.
This pull is a hundred, after careful screening, a dozen hairs without roots are useless, and repeatedly pull from the head a few times, until it is full of a hundred hairs with roots intact.
A hundred hairs were infected with blood in the left hand, and a hundred hairss were held together in the hand.
At once, a hundred long hairs were formed like a cow's hair, like a hedgehog.
He held a hundred long hairs on the top of the dish, and arranged each of the eggs in the dish, and stuck them directly down.
Their skin was not hard, but exceptionally tough and soft, and it took a long time to stab a hundred roots with bloody hair into the skin of their eggs, and into the eggs.
This practice is known as the Yin Yang Line.
Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y
And that's why he's pulling his hair and bleeding himself, is to expect one day to be able to control that kind of fear mantis.
Although he didn't know how powerful the mantis was, even after becoming a monk, he felt that he had no power of retaliation against the mantis.
Almost at the moment when hundreds of hairs were inserted into the pit, the hundreds of hairs were quickly transmitted into the bones of cold, not pure cold, but the kind of feeling as if there had been a false sensation, as if there had been a moment in the pit where the souls were shivering.
This strange feeling put Mia in a state of spiritual ecstasy, gradually, my soul seems to float around in the eternal darkness!
In contrast to ordinary people, this situation means that the soul is not keeping, it means that there is a big problem.
Fortunately, the 'Star's Secret', which he learned, played an enormous role in the critical moment, when the body's hard-worked method was under the influence of the cold, and immediately moved itself in a relentless manner, a warmth quickly expanded to the whole body, and the cold power was swept out of the body instantly, and the suprema.
Miao Yi shivered, woke up quickly from the confusion of his mind, and found immediately that the hundred long faces had frozen in ice.
"My dear," said hes, "these plum eggs are so strange that they make me lose my heart!"
He's expecting what this thing will be like when it hatches.
After setting his mind, carefully recalling the old and the new, the five fingers grasped a hundred long hairs, began silently to guide the power of the hundred long hairs into the hundred dark eggs, to the secret method for it.
In less than half an hour, Mia opened her eyes, took the force, and grasped the hand of a hundred long hairs also relaxed.
Under his work, he had a hundred long hairs melted, and quickly spread out from the roots of the ice pack.
He doesn't know if it's going to be useful.
Turning his palm out of the sack, he drew his lips out of the sack and blew a little cloud of stars to the cut of his left hand. Only the blurred cut of his blood and flesh was healed immediately and at a visible speed.
After returning to the first, Mia looked at the plant in hand without shaking her head, it was really lucky, then the mantis was hanging out from the red dust of the star, if not the plant, to hatch the mantis egg afraid of some trouble.
There is no reason, because according to the secret of the old white doctrine, the Pluto eggs every day to fill the whole body with their fresh blood, it is 98 days, this 98 days, no day can be separated, otherwise you have to give up before.
In other words,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
He washed the blood of his hands in the flowing hot spring.
There was some curiosity among the thousands and the snows that saw what was in her hand. What was in the white, black, and red dish?
Whatever it is, Snow has taken the initiative to help him.
It may be now that they are accustomed to calling, and handed it to her, and was about to say two words, but found Snow's face instantly pale, shivering at the end of the plate, the plate slipped from her hand involuntarily.
Fortunately, Mia reacted quickly, one dragged the plate, and another caught the distorted falling snow arm.
He also responded by neglecting himself, that which was in the dish was very heavy, and that which the common man could not bear.
However, his refined technique was very effective in suppressing the intoxication, and quickly passed into the body of Snow, which would sweep away the intoxication in her body instantly.
The snow that turned white finally came to rest, but had been injured in a moment by the wind, and the man who stood there was still a little empty, and his face was still pale.
CHAPTER 89
"I'm sorry, but you're all people, and you can't touch this thing.
"Are you all right, Snow?"
Thous and Snow looked at the plate, which was untouchable to all.
Snow shook his head and apologized quickly, "It's the slave's fault.
"It's all right," said Mia with a smile. "It's all right," she said.
The two went out of the hall behind him, only to see that the outside was already sunny, and when the thing in the dish saw the sun, the condensed ice cream hair immediately emerged a plume of black smoke, the frost white disappeared, instantly restored the hair's original color.
It is not possible to see the sun melt so fast, it is not possible to smoke.
It is clear that ice covering hair is not a natural ice, but is manifested by a very dark air.
The ice suddenly turned black smoke into hair again made the thousands and the snow, because did not feel the fairy's fairy, instead felt a evil spirit.
Suddenly the black coal, which was lying on the side of the door, sneezed, and lifted his head and opened his eyes, and looked at the thing in his hand, and seemed to feel something.
Nevertheless, as soon as he saw Miao taking the two waitresses to the'starboard', he had nothing to do with himself, and continued to fall asleep, and lazy was lazy.
Thermal Observatory is a high platform that is easy to look at the stars, Thermal Observatory's sleight of hand puts the disk on the ground, the play according to the old saying once it starts, before it hatches, can not let it touch the ground, to be separated from the ground, put on the Thermal Observatory.
Under the sun squatted and watched for a while, the wind blowing a root of hair planted on the Pluto egg, and did not know that the old saying that Pluto was gradually acquainted with and accustomed to this root of hair was false.
"A Thousand, Snow!"
"Here," said the two ladies.
"From now on," said Mr. Seong, pointing at what was on the plate, "I am going to shut down the process, and you two keep the current under the observatory, and do not let anybody come up and touch it, nor do you let it touch the ground under the observatory.
Every day before the sun, or when it rains and you can't see the sun, remember to come and call me in the quiet, and every day before the sun rises, you must come and call me in the quiet.
"I've got it down," said the two ladies.
The Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Five Five Five Five Five Five Five Five Five Five Five Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten
The two nodded again.
"Sew me a coat..." She began by drawing a pattern of a cloth bag for them to sew.
When the two ladies understood what they were saying, they quickly went to get the yarn, and when they came back, they sat by a side and cut the cloth.
Just then, Yan entered the yard, found苗 Yi, said that had contact with the east side of the city, the dock and the ship's construction will begin the same day.
Don't lose the worker's money.
Miao gave an order.
It was not the first time that had been mentioned, and Yan said that he would take care of it, and after he had noticed Snow's face, he asked without hesitation, "Aunt's face doesn't seem so good, is she sick?"
Snow shook his head, remembering the feeling before, still with a heartache.
Seung Yi looked back at Snow still some dark face, know that just hurt the spirit, there is no big problem.
"I'm looking for you two," he said.
Yan asked, "I don't know what the master tells me?"
Didn't both of them have training qualifications?
As soon as this came out, Yan had guessed what Yu was going to say, "But the Master is going to let them both practice?"
Chi and Snow immediately looked quietly, after all it was not the first day, these days constantly hear the people often talk about the refinement, how little and how little know what it means, not by careful heart tightened, little ears raised.
"Yes," said Seung.
That's what he was going to do, and he felt that there was nothing that could be done by the two weak women around him, especially for the practitioners, who were a bit of a problem for him, to go back to the mountains and to invite people to see him, to go for a long time, to climb the mountains, to lie back and forth, to be exhausted, to change the colour of the flower, to go for a long time is not the way to go.
Like Yang, there are two trained waitresses, to do everything is more convenient, and also can be used as a guard.
Especially when he saw snow hit the ball, it almost happened to him to put the thing formally on his mind.
"Where can I get the tricks for the two of them?"
After a moment of reflection, Yan said, "The complete practice is the root of life passed down by the different sects, and is not to be passed down, and in order to control the disciples, it is also to be passed down in stages, and I am afraid it is difficult to get to.
If you have the opportunity to the sea of clouds, there are three no matter the area, the six holy places without a foothold is also mostly in the place, the demons mixed, some do black eating things is normal, but it is possible to buy a lot of money, but without the refined work method no one can guarantee that the purchase is complete, if it is not done well can practice to fire into the devil.
After all, most monks tend to memorize the Dharma in their minds, and even if they are carrying with them, they will do things only by their own understanding, and avoid the exhalation of the Dharma.
"The sea of clouds..."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
"It's too far," she shook her head, "and who's going to risk it anyway, and it's not as safe as you say, is there no other way?"
Yan shook his head, "It's hard! To suppress the number of monks in the world, it's harsh to deal with this private selling of practices!
He didn't say who was suppressing, but when he heard it, he knew it was the Sixth. The Sixth didn't want to see too many people sharing the power of the candle in the world. Once the monks were overwhelmed, everyone wanted to have the power of the candle, there would be turmoil, there would be serious threat to the existing rules, and the Sixth would not allow anyone to threaten them.
He asked with a frown, "Where is the master's maid?"
"It is natural for the lord to teach his own practices, usually should be like this.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a good thing to say, in fact the idea is to make Miao, like other sects, to teach a little bit in stages, so that can also control two waitresses.
