Chapter 368
There was a lot of fire on both sides, and there was a lot of smoke over the sea.
The high-speed scanning gun in his hand at night fired again, and another plane was blown up by him, which was a very good gun, and he was addicted to it, and the little milk bag commanded himself,
The First Terrorist Air Force formed a formidable defensive unit and began the last round of assault.
When Nikla saw the situation was not worthy, the voice raised, "Lord, retreat, let's go again, we'll have the whole army.
Louis's fist was so tight, his face was so dark, and his spirit was so fierce that he could not see what was going on, but he was so unwilling that he was thrown back, and he was so close that he could catch them, and it was so bad.
The man's jade eyes, passing through the killing, turned again into the silent eyes, he pointed to Nikla, he immediately ordered the cover retreat.
Lewis stared at the two of them floating over the sea, and hummed, this time they were lucky, he would not have.
"Baby, are they going to retreat?
Laughing at night, he had his own clock to the magnetic scanner, holding it as if holding a child, with a faint and dangerous smile on his lips.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
This game has turned the situation.
Louis, he shouldn't, he shouldn't be attracted to him, Nono's death, he must find someone to be buried, or he can't breathe this.
When did the game start?
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
"Yes, don't pursue, we have the capital to play with," he said. "I don't know if they're going to get it done.
The little bottle looked at the direction of their escape, laughing silently.
"It's over," said Chu. "There's no more support. we'll go right now."
White Night and Chu left the telephone and ordered the hand to turn back to Rome.
They knew that had a virus, they had taken precautions, and they had been warned that they had a virus, and they had been careful.
Li lying down, breathing like a cow, couldn't help kicking the girl, Little Anna, you have to lose weight, dead again.
His whole shoulder had a bit of hair, because he had been in the sea for a long time, consuming a lot of energy, and then hanging on to Anja's arm, which was so floating, that it was really folded.
He didn't catch her out of the sea, but he still felt a bit creepy when he remembered the scene.
All the Black Eagles were happy because they were safe, handing over towels handing over towels, handing over hot water, one can't be busy, and one can't be entertained in the air.
There was a lot of fun on the plane, and the men were together.
She washed her hair with the black eagle handed over, and wrapped her cold body with a blanket.
She had a sneeze and couldn't help but tighten up.
The Black Eagle, laughing, said, Thirty-three, madam, thinner than you want her to be.
"I don't like it now.
The three leaves came up and wiped the sea, because the bones were so heavy.
The Black Eagle had two pairs of clothes to change, because it was a man's dress, which was very funny on Miss Cheung, and she barely wrapped herself in a blanket.
As soon as he changed his clothes, the Black Eagle told her that she would rather speak to her.
Jiang Yang excitedly grabbed the phone, " baby, it's Mom.
Hi, Mom, do you want a baby?The little baby sat on the couch, smiling, and chatting with Cheng Anya, hadn't heard her mom's voice for a long time.
"I don't want at all.
"You're too busy to find Mommy tonight," he said.
Better to think of a promise, tos of heart, and to smile, "Well, baby, wait for you to return to Rome, and you can do whatever you like,
I miss you don't hurt me, you disrespect me.
"Resentment."
Joan laughed, and asked, Are you not hurt?
"No, I'm fine, there's nothing to worry about," said Nan, smiling, "Mommy, the plane's about to land," said Nan.
"All right.
The little milk bag shut the communications, Cheng Anya drinking hot water warming the body, the Leth three little eyes looked to be able to talk to the son, and the result of not talk to hang on, He was very dissatisfied, eyes complaining to Che Che Che Anya.
Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss
Ye, feeling completely ignored, couldn't resist twisting Miss Cheng, "no conscience little thing.
"The little bastard."
Joan laughed, and gave him the hot water, and he drank the rest of the hot water.
It would be more beautiful to be warmed with a little wine.
As soon as the plane landed in the castle, Chu, Ye Wei, and the eleven others were there, and as soon as Ye three and the flight was safe, all of them breathed.
"My brother and sister, it's really confusing..."
Levy laughed and trembled, "Brother, I should have taken it for a memorial.
"The filthy girl."
Xiao laughed and said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's taken so long. How can it happen again?
Little Couple wanted to hold Anya, but she was forced to drink, Little Couple it came to mind, his mother had a virus, the Black Eagle had said, and then he looked at his father's mother's hands, and his heart sank a little.
"Dad, Mum, you all...night, you're going to help them."
The first reaction is to find the night, he is a genius, without he can't cure the disease.
You know, Don't worry.
laughed.
"Virus?"
A Man with Gold and Blue Eyes blinked, Little White, isn't that your strength?
Little White?
Their wrists twisted, smiling softly, Jason, shout a little white try again?
What's up with the old man calling you little white?
It was little white, and you call it black jack little iron.
Jason, known as the Flaming Dragon, is on the scene flaming, like the King of the Golden Fleece, but as handsome as the gods resent.
Especially those blue eyes, as bright as blue gems.
There was a burning flame, like a volcano, and a very outward kind of hegemony.
Black Jack was a young man of more than twenty years of age, who was a mixture of Chinese and English, and who possessed the mystery of the East and the depth of the West.
A pair of gray blue eyes, which always look like fog, give one a deep feeling, but look closely, you will find that he is extremely sharp, and has a deep and unspoiled convergence.
The two leaders of the first terrorist organization, are not old, have different characteristics, but the atmosphere is strong, one has a kind of kingdom of the world, not to mention the three great capitals here.
This line looks past. It's very visual.
Jason, you must have been repaired.
No No No No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of them.
Eve looked at them, shaking her head, "Brothers, sisters, don't worry about them, you'll take a hot shower, take another look, and you won't get sick.
She invited the maid to take Yechen and Cheng Anya down to wash and wash, and the little lad, though he wanted to follow, stayed here, and at night he was going to beat, and the little lad quickly pulled his sleeves.
"Byee, can you save my mother?"
The children's eyes are bright, like two black grapes embedded in the pale face, full of expectation, as if at a white night, the light in his eyes will fade.
Jason grabbed the little bottle in his arms, with a great deal of pride, " baby, you can rest assured that little white dead man will be saved, and not that living man,
You're worried about shit. There's a chance to blow up the black party's defense.
"Who ever questioned therapist at night?" Black Jack doubted, and Jason glanced away.
The little bottle was held by a tall boy, with an unusual twist, kicked Jason, "Let me down.
"The old man wants such a son," said the old man. "The old man wants such a son.
Jason's blue eyes shining, like a small milk bag is a fat meat.
All of them.
He said with a smile at night, Jason, don't let your mother teach you in Chinese, and don't keep saying the Chief won't use words, and you won't get anywhere.
"I'm not on a level, okay?"
Jason was dissatisfied with the fact that he had been linked to the Chief, the so-called Chief of Staff, was a matter of principle.
After a struggle, Jason let him down, he asked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Be quiet," he said. "Be quiet until I check them and make sure you don't have to hurry."
"I'm sure I'll do my best," said White.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
"Don't worry," said White.
"It is," said Eve, "it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it
Chu smiled, "I agree."
Little White, do you have a sign?
Jason was deeply doubting he had no sign at all.
Eleven wanted to beat him.
"How come you two didn't catch Louis back?" asked Black Jack, "This guy's gonna die soon.
"The old man wanted to kill him," he said. "The gang is all over the place, and the guy's headquarters have been bombed, and he's got a good mood, and he's pretty stupid."
Louis was not in a hurry, said the little bottle, with a dangerous curve on his face, and with his dark eyes the brightness of a calculator. He and we have one thing in common, but the fight between the gangs and the terrorists is another.
It's going to cost a lot of money.
Throughout this time, his position in the Black Party has been shaken, and I have always doubted that the Black Party still has a power hidden from us, or that they will not be able to stop this act of self-destruction of Louis, and since so, we shall let Louis take the way for us, and seize this power, and destroy it.
Fraud!
That's what everybody agrees on.
Knowing he was always angry and dangerous, but because he was too young, people would always fall in love, plus a long pink appearance, always let go of his essence.
"I'm in the dark!"
Jason raised his thumb, he was always an action, not the rest thought about so much, but most of the time he would listen to the plans of Black Jack and Chu.
He always listened to the plan of the little milk.
After a full movement there is a powerful group of thinkers, which is a terrifying force.
"I agree with this method," said Chu, who had always agreed with his ideas, "it will be a long time before someone who is not high and thick will come and provoke."
"If it is," he said, "when have you refuted it?
Black Jack laughed, but this time, he must teach the Black Party a lesson, that in fifty years he will see us go.
He had no concern,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ye and 11 look at each other, another force?
In their hearts a face like a touch, is it a black and a black?
Within the Black Party, only they could have enough summons, and mysterious, except for them, they could not think of anyone else, who could have such power, and who should have been the man over whom Louis, without reason, obeyed.
All the crowded into the room, and the little bottle of milk went to Cheng-and she had taken a good bath, and a cup of hot tea, and she was warm and baked, and her cheeks were red, and she was in bed looking at her fingers, if she had thought.
"Mom...
"The little bottle pushed into the door and came close with laughter.
Joan came back to God, squinted, and praised, "Honey, you have a fan.
This costume, which has a little bit of a child's taste, is a dangerous person.
"Thank you," Mom said.
Don't come near, sit away, I'm afraid I can't beat you.
Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go
The little bottle stared angrily at her, "Ma, you don't want to leave me.
"The correct answer. "
Joan laughed, looked at the little bottle, she always felt that the child had something different, though it looked nothing like the past, but the mother was the most aware of her child, of what had changed in him, how well she could feel, no matter what she had hidden.
"Mom, how do you think of me?
Do you think your baby is cute?
The little milk bag blinked angrily, look very cute.
Joan looked at him smilingly, "You've learned a lot about your father's love, aren't you? Tell Mommy the truth
Have you been deceived?
Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak
"Well," said Louis, "I've seen the pictures, and it's clear that he's been beaten with blood."
Chen, apparently, did not believe, and bite his teeth, "He's been beaten with a thousand knives, and I don't hate him.
Reminded of all that she had encountered, she hated Louis in her heart.
Her bright face washed with cold, and her feelings were worse when she thought of what she had been through.
Mommy, I'm all right, it's mostly his.
The little bottle smiled gracefully, held up the sleeves, revealed a white arm, "Look, there is no wound.
His arm was healed seven eight, and soon, he was no more afraid of being found by Cheng An.
All the whips he'd been whipped had been left, and since he'd been whipped, he didn't feel like he'd been deceived, but rather he felt the pain of being whipped.
If No was alive, he would have been beaten like this all his life.
"It's okay?
Cheng Anja glanced, did not miss the pain in the eyes of the son flashed.
Little Milk nodded,I'm really okay, Mommy, it's you and Daddy, Daddy says you've got a virus, and Daddy's got a virus.
She thought of the three leaves of the beetle, and her cheeks were red again, and she had no desire or hope to say, "Don't mention, I jumped once in the desert, I jumped once in the sea, and how can I not touch it."
Miss Cheung said softly, and the little milk bag had no doubt of him.
"Mom, it's not going to happen," said therapist. "It's so bright that there must be a way to save you."
CHAPTER 369
At night, after a detailed examination, the two were separately taken out of the blood to make a more comprehensive analysis, his face was rarely condensed, the small milk bag had a less than good sense.
At first he was struck, infected with germs, the doctor determined not to amputate to survive, but at night did not see even a glance, leaving a sarcastic word, entered the laboratory elegantly.
It's like there's no disease in the world that can't be beaten by a genius. Last year, Chu took 23 shots.
He's a mythical existence, shouldn't make him feel awkward disease.
But this time, as Jason was expecting, the virus was not strong for the white night, and once he had shown his consternation, it was clear that things were not going well, for which Jason was very friendly and sympathetic to the white night.
You've finally encountered doubt, it's hard, it's better than a little milk bag in the field of computer technology is a mythical existence, but is broken by two brothers.
White Night contacted Rome ten virus experts came to the castle to study together, the whole castle fell into a congested atmosphere.
The party is very clear.
She had her eyes opened, and on her way she felt that even death was not much.
She had a life of love,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She knew enough of the days when the rocks were falling.
The only regret is not to see the peace, now the wish for her is also realized, so to live and to die she is no matter, even less to leave.
Neither was afraid of death and showed much more than they had expected to calm down.
said Chu, that is the spirit.
As they were in the conference room talking about the virus, and about the remaining five days of life, Chen suddenly remembered one thing, "You shouldn't be able to delay the trial of the virus for us for a few days.
Once again, she was about to forget the face and Chu away from this thing.
Even though he had not told them to take the message to Chu, how could not take it, it was a compromise, even though he had not said, Cheng Anja and Ying Zhao would have informed Chu.
As soon as Chu opened his eyes and his eyes were fixed on Cheng-the kind of eyes that, in silence, with a sharpness of urgency, frightened Cheng Cheng; and as Jason and Black Jack and others were laughing, they were suddenly quieted.
"There's news about you."
asked Chu calmly, his tone normal, but too suppressed, he was tight, everyone could see, he was very stiff.
The Little Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che
He left only two words and hurried away. Jason Black Jack hurried to get up and follow him.
It's hard to see him in a hurry.
There'll be another massive military operation, with the three giants fighting together, and it'll be absolutely fierce.
Eve is in the heart for Prince William.
Someone's half of Jiangshan must be gone, it's not all gone.
Now that's all he's got on his mom's virus, he's thinking, a man comes up, "My little lord, Chugo, let me go to the library.
The little milk wrapped his lips. "Dad, Mom, I'll come with you for a while."
At a glance, Zhang and Zhao Zhao had a sense of the beginning of my family, little lord, it seems that the first terrorist organization is established, look at this attitude, which is different from the good son before her.
After all, since the son has chosen, then a way to the dark, she supported.
It's a very proud thing. It's a very proud thing.
If Jian had a thoughtful look at his shadow disappearing in the corridor, return to God to ask Eve, Eve, what is going on?
"I'm a mother," she said, "but the little milk doesn't mean she'll believe he's all right.
Eve admired her three sisters' sharpness, and when she looked at the eleven, considering not to say anything about the promise, she knew at a glance that something must have been hidden from them.
"Vyvy," said she.
Eve took a look at them, and spoke of Ninening and the promise, including the death of the promise, the small milk bag blind, fifteen and ten, without concealing.
The more he listened, the heavier his heart was.
Surprisingly, she thought his eyes were different, rather than so clear and clean in the past, even though his background was different, he was in the past just a child, and somewhat simple.
There are things that she's experienced, that she's been shocked by, that she's changed her eyes, that she's come out feeling different, that she's not more than that.
Leth also twisted his eye, a little heartache of the son's experience, and in the heart of all self-blame, that if it were to change the way Anja died for him, I am afraid he would not be able to go mad, why is blindness so simple.
This is very similar to what happened to him in the past.
"The girl is sure she is dead," she asked.
Levy nodded,Our people have searched and confirmed that is dead,and when I say No,I'm going to be angry.
Levy, touching the table, said of the promise again, All the evil things are paralyzed on Nono, the Lord is a king.
Ye had a little to do with his business, and he was a good man, and could not have been so enthusiastic, could he not have had an inner feeling?
"No," said 11, "I have looked at the family, and indeed there is such a plan, even though it is a plan, but it is true that the family also has such a curse, but it is too cruel for the parents to give up their promises and to let others grow up.
And they were silent, and said, Behold, the future of my son is grievous.
Especially Chen, she was not anxious, but she knew her son best, looked like the past, but after all, it was only a deceiving image.
When the heart is as dead as flesh.
Don't worry too much either. After all, you're a little girl, and maybe you'll grow up.
After all, said Y, two children, the feelings are deeper, and with the passage of time they will gradually fade.
Even deeper love in this world can not withstand the destruction of time.
Chen smiled, and said a soft yes, only to make them feel better, even the three of them know that it is harder to forget than to remember.
It takes just a second to love someone.
Forget about one, but for life.
Ye asked little about the recent of the dragon, Ye Wei did not hide, said 15, the situation is not optimistic, the three giants of the dragon are in trouble, especially Lin Yean, the recent trouble is continuing.
Brother, don't worry about this. It's only right that you've got the virus out of you.
Levy laughed,This thing is not going to go, it's going to take a break, it's going to take a rest, you don't know, sir, it's been a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time.
Can't the new weapons war, and the world's largest illegal weapons dealer, blow?
According to Jason last night, there have been ten or three countries that have purchased the gun for free, and all weighted countries that have issued joint statements to oppose terrorists and eliminate terrorist organizations, and as a result have been paying for our weapons.
So say, truth, you are the cloud!
Eve laughed more.
Miss Cheung did not comment, Le smiled, and the arms market in Jason, Black Jack and Chu in the hands of three, indeed control many international throat blood.
It's so strong that no one can ignore.
Their next heir would be their family, and the power would be estimated to be greater.
After a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What happened?
The boy didn't mention No when he came back.
"I understand," said Cheung. "Thank you," said Cheung. "If it were not for you, I would have liked to have seen more.
"We're all going to thank you for your life," she said.
At noon, five fighter aircraft took off from the castle, and three helicopters took off from the castle.
In fact this thing can be done by one person, there are no difficulties in the world to make the three heads of terror move together, Jason is bored, Black Jack is bored, anyway, Black Hand Party is not going to make it, just happens to be a life-saving stage, they also want to be active active.
The laboratory was packed with dozens of virus experts in a panic.
His face was so heavy that, for the first time, he put his hands together, and his dim and distant eyebrows were close together.
"Mr. White, who developed this virus?"
"I've been doing this forty years, and I've never seen a virus like this," said the head of the virus team.
"He's working with the Black Party," said White, staring at the decomposition of virus molecules on a huge LCD screen. "The virus is not his stronghold, but he's involved a little, he's involved a little, and he's done a good job, but he's never really seen a virus so complicated.
"That's bad," said the captain. "In June last year, more than a hundred virus experts came to Rome, and one of them was my friend.
He says he's studying a virus for the Black Party, mostly this one.
Can You Find Him?
Ask quietly, more than a hundred virus experts, I'm afraid are the top talent.
"He's dead," said the captain, "and it's clear when you hear it at night.
This group of viruses is under the control of terrorists, is the best group of experts in Rome, they say they can't, I'm afraid...
Hope is low.
"Mr. White, have you no idea?
"I've had one of the most difficult diseases," he shook his head at night.
This virus is too complicated.
"You can get the best remedies for a day. "
' said the captain, 'the medicine is not, but the relief is.'
At most, however, it can only be relieved for about 20 days.
Their eyes were sharp, and their hearts were depressed.
"Mr. White," I said, "I've checked all the virus history. This is a new virus that has never appeared before."
"But in 1934, this virus was spread in Siberia, and it was infectious, and it was a cell virus, and the people who carried it had the same symptoms as Miss Cheung
The only difference is that there is no second wave transmitter, the transmitter, and also a month of life, but the principle should be similar.
The government's external claiming that was a nuclear war leak is actually due to the spread of the virus.
As soon as the white eyes lighted on the report, almost greedy reading the information above, the virus was called su- 1934, extremely scary, that year spread in a small town of Siberia,
Later, the government shut down all exits to prevent the spread of the virus and cleaned up the entire town, killing nearly 50,000 people.
It's also a cell virus that they can find the most similar cases.
"Look at all the information, I want all the the information.
A quiet order, the man nodded, and immediately went down to collect.
A white night with a hand in front of the computer, squinting eyes, in the laboratory, people come and go, shaped hurry, are studying this virus, and all kinds of tests are starting to be combined.
"I don't think so, Mr White," he said, "because they've been studied, they're sure to find a cure."
"It takes a long time to study a new virus," said the captain.
Even with anes, they can only delay it for 20 days, I'm afraid they haven't got it yet.
Besides, this virus is extremely unstable, and is a cell virus, if it is temporary, the relieving agent is not useful, and by the time will surely die.
"Do it yourself," he said.
He washed his face at night, and spoke great words.
Captain
All Louis could have gone Aya and Le Trois a little ruthlessly, and you want him to give a cure, which is impossible.
He would have expected that they would have given Miss Li and Miss Li, and he would have expected that they would not have, and that he would have found him, and at that time he was sure that the dragon had seen him, and that he had not yet found him, and that no one had found him.
It's a risk.
He was convinced that Louis would never appear in the near future.
After they came back last night, they were busy checking, taking blood samples, they were both asleep and uncomfortable, after all very tired, plus the virus was slowly swallowing the body, they were both unable to eat.
Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss
"Aunt, has he been like this for a few days?
It's been five days, said Eve.
The little milk is very strange to such a beautiful city, purple eyes, as pure as a flower, which has not been environmentally polluted, has not been in the past a wickedness and a wickedness.
It's awful to see what he's doing now with his wife.
"Woman," you said, "I'm bad."
He wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He wasn't so...so... tender when he was three years old with Mommy.
Eve had a habit of moving his feet and touching his head.
Really? She washed with pure eyes.
Yee's face not red heart not jump, Of course, when did the wife deceive you?
Little Mermaid.
It's too...
It's clear.
He had to feel that's not like the ordinary.
"Aunt, can he find me?"
Little Milk doesn't care whether or not he hears it.
"He said he couldn't find it," said YV. "It's a big ice," she said, "and it looks like a cow.
Little Milk Pack
With another expression of grieving, holding Ying always bite, the small milk bag deeply felt unsuitable for children, went up to the laboratory.
"Nin, how come?"
"Isn't there an idea?
A glance at the heavy face of the little milk bag knows that things are not well, he is mentally prepared.
At this moment, someone sent the 1934 virus information, said the White Night, "I'll talk to you for a while.
He looked carefully at this information, the little milk bag curious, also in the past to look together, the su-1934 in the information is comprehensive, harm, the number of deaths, the government hard measures, at night the most concerned is his designer.
"Shu"
Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu
Very few people know that virus is at risk.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
Chapter 370
Knowing that was designed by Grandpa Suman in 1934, he immediately contacted Suman, and on the other side was very angry, very angry, staring at the little package, ten fingers long like a ghost would pinch the throat of the little package, and straightened him up.
11 Naturally knows why, very quietly laugh.
He looked at his wife with his soft lips and said, wife, how terrible!
Everybody nodded, really scary,
The three were afraid of their own sister eating their own son, this expression, not ordinary scary, everyone felt very scary.
Nobody but 11 knows why.
Aunt, What are you doing A A A A A A A A
"I hate you"
Ye's charming face turned into a ghost's grieving and resentment, the eyes had a bit of creeping,
What's he's talking about, there's a response from suman.
"Be quiet."
Suman's sounded like a morning wind blowing over the top of the mountain, with a refreshing, clean to the dust, it sounded like a high not to climb, not to be profaned.
"Well, Sue, I have something to do with you. Is it convenient to go online? I'll send you something.
Nine's voice was so urgent that when he called Suman for the first time, he forgot to call, and at this moment even his own aunt's grieving eyes were gone.
What's wrong?
"Yes, it's a life-saving thing."
No No No No No No.
Come on, I'm on line.
Suman did not ask, he said softly, Ninning just said a good word, and Ywei grabbed the phone, "So beautiful, have you seen me for a long time, have you thought of me?
It's quiet down there.
"Ive?"
"Why do you call it? It's enough to call it the slave.
Let's not look like that's what we've all been talking about.She's got a cell phone and she's laughing at what's called a buzz.
Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel
The coldness washed away in a moment, the eleventh, the white night, and the Ying at the same time, Ying just looked at the Ying at a glance and the gorgeous oblivious.
It's more than it is.
At that instant, all seemed to think that he was going to return to his former wickedness, but his eyes were still so clean, though full of murder, that there was no wickedness
With his fist, very sad, but without any real action.
They're relieved.
"I'm busy," said Suman. "I'm busy," he said.
The beauty of Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y
She wants tos a man, whoever the other, only to avoid, absolutely no level of playing the opponent can resist.
"She's not very interesting," she said, "and she's sent three words to the slaves."
Evey, holding the phone,,I'm not wasting my feelings for the sake of the slaves.
Chen and Chen smiled, and went to the small milk bag at night, and would have sent the information at night to Suman.
The Eleven pointed to the ghostlike ink, and Y was smiling, and asked, purely innocent, "Who deceived you, O White?
Tell your wife to help him.
It was also very interesting, with his finger pointed directly to YV, grievingly complained, "Woman, you have deceived me.
All of them.
Shen smiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't even know what a face is.
Eve laughed softly,You mean, I'll have to beat myself?
Mel stared at her, and ran to her, holding her sleeve, and cried, "Wow, who is he, who is he, and why are you so good to him?
You'll get him!
Eleven is a bit creepy.

And now I understand everything.
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
Later, if he returned to the previous he remembered the days when he was a great white.
A.
I'm afraid that's not enough for him. How cruel is this man! How can he be so good?
She's worried about her future.
Ying gently touched the face, laughed charming, " big white, how can you wrong the wife, he is hundreds of kilometers from me, how can not get, to get the wife also get you.
"Woman, you don't love.
Big White is good.
She had a poor look, and she was afraid that she had thrown him.
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
Don't fall in love with you!
You're a beauty.
"The wife..."
M M M M M M M M M M M M
Otherwise the old man beats you don't even recognize your brother.
All of them.
Miss Jiang and Mr Jiang weren't happy watching the play, and they looked at each other smiling, and they thought that the way the two of them got together was interesting, and Miss Jiang thought that the two extremes of the man were really challenging.
At first she had seen the wounds on Eve, and had been beaten to the point of intolerance, and the iron on her wrist had almost destroyed her hand, and it was from these wounds that she knew how cruel the man was.
Now it's really challenging to be so white, to rub and to rub and to rub.
Only a woman as brave as Y will survive him.
Their eyes were filled with tears, their delicate lips trembled and their leaves fell like autumn, and everyone around them was terrified.
For the first time, in contrast to the Yan who had been seen in the supermarket, the lips of the little cheerful be bent, "Aunt White, do you know who Sue is?
My Aunt's old lover Oh, my Aunt is very enthusiastic about him, and has been following people for a year.
This time I've got a way to contact Suman, but she doesn't, so Aunt is jealous of me.
As soon as she heard this, her eyes looked more sadly at her, and she stood up, angrily, and she was very handsome, and she was very brave to take off her sleeve.
Levy stared at...
O O O!
Come on, you're making up!
Look at her back. She's got a little bit of a temper.
Miss Cheung smiled softly, "Vy, you don't go to comfort, he is really attracted to hair.
Didn't he seem to be angry with you the first time?
From that day on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Where to leave, he fear leave a little unhappy to give him to run,
That's amazing.
The eleventh explanation is that Y has not only infected people with color, but also infected the temper.
After a wave of milk, laughed gracefully, raised a thumb at night, after all, to see the play of Yves, it was hard to get, some free screening, he naturally enjoyed watching.
Against him.
The Lady rose to the table, and went out with a great stride, and looked as if she had taken a sword.
"Aunt," said Suman. "Oh," said Suman.
The little bottle shouted behind her, and she seemed to not hear, and to not see at the blink of an eye.
Everyone laughed, and it was a good thing, but it was a very good thing, and a very strange thing.
They say little white and black are perfect. That's good.
Although this white is thorough.
Suman obviously had the information of 1934, and the analysis of this new virus, he himself is a virus expert, and look at these professional things too quickly.
SUMAN: You brought people.
Mother Max: Is There Any Help?
Suman:7.
Mother Max: Okay, I'll go right now.
Suman sent an address to the little milk, the night he remembered, he was a little curious, "Seventy per cent, is he sure? We have so many experts at our disposal, can he?
There's a lot to say, but look at the information, there's a seven-percent chance.
"Yes," said Suman. "Yes," said Suman. "Let's go," said Suman.
It will take a few hours to get here and come back soon, said the little milk.
It's an opportunity he doesn't leave any chance to heal his parents.
Miss Cheokokokokokokokokokokok
`I'll go,' said White Night, his face pale, and he could see no emotion, but only himself, how curious and enthusiastic he was.
CHAPTER 371 The Beautiful
There's always a power comparison between men. White Night is called a genius doctor. He's in trouble, and so many experts are in trouble with viruses.
The man at first said he had a seven, usually like a man like them, and at first said he had a seven, then changed the explanation, and saved.
It's amazing how strong this man really is.
Moreover, a high-speed magnetic pulse can open his eyes.
Suman's name is like Ray.
There was nothing to do with Ya, and it would not take much time to go, and since they were told that they had hope of being healed, they were not happy to come, and the plane was soon ready under the arrangement of peace and night.
The first terrorist organization was temporarily assigned to Clode, who at night let the experts in the laboratory continue to study the virus, and once the analysis reports were sent to them immediately, to avoid Suman repeating the study.
Everything was arranged in order, and hadn't taken into account Levy 11 and Levy, who knew that the plane was going to take off, Levy dragged Levy onto the plane, Levy onto the plane, and Levy onto the plane, she and Levy onto the plane.
Furthermore, it is possible to meet with.
"Aunt, what are you going to do?"
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
He also thinks he's going to give his mom and dad a cure for the virus.
"Why can't I go?
Soman and I haven't been talking for a long time.
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
Are you talking?
People are very suspicious, talking is not so stimulating, She is dreaming to hook up with Suman?
In fact, there is such a great beauty, Ye also remembered about Suman, the whole group is very nervous, what is it really a goddess, too charming.
Even the constantly over the top of the milk bag lifted Suman to the heart of the mouth.
Take a look again, just on the face sleeve away, very brave, the atmosphere is very good, how to turn the eye again is a wife murder is also a reasonable wife slave, holds Eve not to shake hands, is a typical wife what is not brave.
Isn't this change too big?
Xiao and White White said, Big White, are you jealous?
She was holding her, pointed at her head, with a pure face, seemingly not to be jealous.
Ye, once again, said he was so rare, that he was not so good at Miss.
Occasionally hanging Miss to see her own throwing of rose leaves is addictive.
Jia also raised her thumb, "The trainer has the skill, Vivi, when there is no teaching two ways.
All right, I'll make sure you're all right.
Miss Li pulls the process, laughs very dangerous, very angry, " Little Anna, I'm not good enough for you, you also learn what the trainer calls,
I'm not satisfied. I'll change my husband.
The little milk was shaking, and he and the white night went together.
Take a look at the eleven eyebrows, Y smiled, "It's sour, brother, what do you eat at noon, don't bring such a threat, you'll be so good as big white, the three sisters will be better to you, more gentle.
He had to be as white as the ink, and it was estimated that Miss Cheung would be more able to oppress him than Eve, and he did not.
Besides, he didn't dress ink so purely not polluted, let go.
That's what I think.
Miss Cheung thinks it's very reasonable, she thinks that's what she expects, that's what she expects, that's what she expects.
Come, my dear, and look at me with a smile.
The three little lip corners shake.
The wind was the same as the leaves. He learned ten to ten things. He felt that his wife must be more than two hundred meters away from his sister, so as not to get hurt.
Levy laughed in her arms, even 11's lips could not lift, a bit of laughter.
The little bottle washed over the eyes, said the child, Mother, the watch is so stimulating, is not suitable for children,
You also have to take care of such a pure heart.
All of them.
Pure?
Do you want purity or darkness?
She smiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I love you.
The little bottle fell deeply on the shoulder of the white night, expressing comfort, "It is indeed too terrible, to mourn for you in the future.
White Night, Chu, and others long suffered from Ye Wei, 11's bullying, long had a relative, now to meet Miss Zhang's evil hobby, is that people will feel women very scary.
White Night also returned to the shoulder of the small milk bag, as well as expressed condolences, "I too for you after twenty years.
Excuse me, I don't need it.
The little bottle smiled, and the man who wanted to be poisoned was gone, and nothing was left.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
Miss Cheung had a smile on her ears when she heard that, her heart felt heavy, and at one point she did not know what to say to the little milk bag, but looked at him deeply.
The others did not expect No to go up there, still joking, the three of them were a family, already very mature, and on the night of the pain of the small milk, although indifferent to the people, but he grew up with the others, and the emotions were good,
There was a lot of talk between nature and the leaves, and the atmosphere was still very lively, and there was nothing to worry about the virus.
Everyone's anxious. He can't be anxious.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Eve kicked her foot, and when the ice had learned to see her play, it had to be played.
In fact, she thinks the two plays are not worth.
Don't say she's curious, Miss Li and the little milk bag are all curious, with several eyes fixed on her.
She said,Suman is not like me, she has abandoned Suman, not abandoned me, I am the original.
All of them.
The cold people like Ra 11 were shaken, more to say, Cheng Yan and others.
Vivi, you can say this, it's true...
It's awful.
"Brother White," said Vivi, "I'm sure that's an absolute falsehood, and you can believe that she's excited when she hears Susan."
After many years of oppression, it is not easy to get the chance to return, naturally fear the world is not disturbed.
The Small Pack also expresses doubt.
With a blank eye, looking at the look of the heads of all, and looking at Y, pulling Y Y's sleeve, asked, "Woman, will you deceive me?"
"No," she said. "The beauty is light, and her face is not changed."
She said she wouldn't cheat on me.
It's awful that white ink can be taught to be like this by Eve.
The little milk bag laughed very happy.
As a male compatriot, white night respects ink to a hundred.
She was lying on her shoulder, laughing and shaking. This man is so cute.
Miss Cheung wasted her time, saying that you don't have to make a distinction, is not a typical little white rabbit.
"Vyvy," she said, "it's your trick."
"The three sisters have won."
The two women smiled, Miss Chang looked at the leaves, the spine of the leaves, the hair of the bones, the gray of the correction,
There is a lot of little Anya's wicked interests, and it is seen that it is definitely one of the ways to die.
Little Anna, stop the strange picture in your mind, I and him are not a dish.
Ying made a statement at once.
M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M
Levy laughed,My brother, our house is more tender than yours, it is delicious, it is pure from the outside.
This is absolutely true.
Miss Chen smiled more gently,Your brother doesn't even know how to write two pure words.
And the little milk, Mother, if you feel uncomfortable, try to get out of the wall.
She's a beauty.
Be careful the old man killed you.
If she could hit a man at this moment, she would have gone to the spoon behind the small milk bag, and she would have liked to have said one thing, So-Bein was a slave, but she would have wisely swallowed the words back, without any prejudice to the pure white face of So-Bein.
Looking at the oppressed two male compatriots, the night feels alone is really good, the sun shines, the life is good.
"What are you talking about, wife?"
She asked with sincerity.
"Well, I agree with what you just said," said Jian, "she's better than Suman, and she's the world's first to grow up like that."
There are no pairs in the world, she has never seen such a beautiful person, if a woman, sure to give to man a fairy all the shock, especially a pair of purple eyes like water, more than a little charm.
Even though he is now as pure as white paper, but with a smile charm, no one can be compared.
Ye did not comment on this, but laugh.
Little Anna, do you dare to be a man, do you not want to live?
Le 3 n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n
Miss Cheokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokok
You really don't look like that.
As the little bottle touched his chin thought, I'm also curious about what Suman looks like, Aunt, really?
Ask 11.
Ye waved hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand
The Eleven looked at Ming and said, Each has a thousand autumns.
"That should be the man of heaven.
The Little Milk.
Huang Yang looked at the jade in front of the milk bag and wondered, "My dear, what are you wearing
Are you falling?
Isn't this girl thing? Her son doesn't always wear this thing.
The little bottle smiled, the pain flashed, instantly returned to calm, he just to answer, to help him with the ink, "It's my Nono.
It's a little dark.
It is not known to any of the three orphans or to the three orphans.
If the little cherry had been left unattended outside, the expression was calm, not to see any sadness, not to see any despair, but many years later, Jiang An-ya remembered the scene again did not know.
There's a quietness called dead water.
"It's good," said Cheng, softly, "I'm going to take a look at you."
"Well, I think it looks good too."
Looking at the scenes of their joy, he remembered Nono, who would not sleep at night, afraid that one night he would dream of her again, but when he awakened, he could only catch the regret that remained in the air, and not sleep at night.
These feelings, he experienced too early, he felt more in the heart.
As time settles, this memory becomes more and more clear, firmly printed in the mouth, slowly add to the print, no longer erased, life as a shadow, he keep this memory for life, and no repentance.
There was a silence on the shoulders of the little milk, but the three knocked on the table, "Don't, don't you take a fool home?
To meet the brave to get away from, do not listen to the loss?
Miss Miss.
It's too early for this love enlightenment.
The little milk bag with ten hands, puts out the most venerable gesture and expression, "The wise God-bearer, the little boy must follow the teaching, no more dare.
Everyone laughed.
The atmosphere was once again, Cheng Ya smiled, and said nothing more, but the heart was very pained, and he looked at her with this kind of bold smile, and was very touched.
The airplane landed on a private deck, a vast estate, like a desert, with vast palm trees and palm trees, and in the center of the garden a well-built fountain.
In the courtyard of the elegant villas, there is a variety of strange plants, and the estate is ancient, and there is a thick historical taste, and in the bend of the corridor hangs a crystal lamp of the petals of the flower, which is exceptionally beautiful.
came to meet their maid a black robe, a black head, a black sand, a typical Arab woman dressed,
Take them all the way to the hall.
Eva greeted them with a pleasant smile, and one of them laughed in English, "The master is having a headache again.
It was very hot in the summer, but the hall was very cool, and according to the observations of the night, he found that the walls were made of ice, and there was nothing to see on the surface, but it was very cold to touch,
This is a special design to reduce summer heat.
Don't worry.
Their walls are made of ice.
Eve and eleven had lived here for a long time, and it was unfamiliar, and Eve automatically to take the fruit on the table thirsty.
It's awful hot summer in Riyadh, it's hot air, it's dry.
Shortly afterwards, the maids brought their ice-creams and their fruit desserts, because they knew the tastes of the leaves and the eleven, and prepared for them both two glasses of blue-green fruit.
"I didn't think you remembered my love," said Eve in Arabic.
Diana smiled and said, The Master is receiving the Prince of the Seven, and will come in a moment.
Doesn't it look good?
Ye is very gossip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dana's big eyes are smiling, "You don't look good.
Ye is successful.
You're too stubborn, sister.
He shook his head at her shoulder at night.Can your family hear Arabic?
You've got to get the inside out before you hook up.
Keep the backyard from burning.
Levy, having forgotten this, said in Arabic to Mr. White, my drink is not good, let us change.
She was very clever to change hers and hers, and her eyes immediately stopped, "No, I suddenly feel good to drink.
This guy understands.
Little Milk laughed, and explained to Cheng Anya again, that these people did not understand the Arabic, and that she did not understand the foreign languages, English, Japanese, and French.
Shortly afterwards, someone outside shouted at the master, and he saw a steadfast figure slowly walking into the eyes of the people, with a white robe and a light and quiet faintness around him.
It is an unholy purity.
Yang's first feeling is that's a beauty!
There was only one thought.
The beauty smiles.
CHAPTER 372
Suman, a tall man, dressed like an Arab, with white robes, black crowns, white scarves, and with white robes, long hair bound with silver ribbons.
A thin, long, like a long mountain, a pair of dark, bright eyes, like the springs of the mountains, with a slight cleanness in the cold, looked like the wind blowing on the ice, cold, stiff.
His nose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
All man gives man a sense of arrogance, coldness, and highness, which cannot be profaned.
It is not wrong to think of a woman, because it is a man who is extremely confident and strong, a woman's family, who will have this kind of force, and this kind of forgiveness, which is only my self-esteem.
White,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This appearance was absolutely one hundred per cent brilliant man, he stood there, the whole world seemed to be accompanied, he became the only light, the whole hall, no one man or woman, no man, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
But as soon as he came out, a silence, was shaken by this beauty, even to see the familiar with his beauty, Ye Wei and 11 were shaken, and some are not tired of how to see, how to see, he still as at first sight.
Suman's eyes were sweeping the men and women of the hall; he had been accustomed to the brilliant eyes of others; his eyes were on the small chest of milk; his lips were not often smiling, and he lifted them a little.
Come on, come on, come on.
Sweetie,the slaves want to kill you.
Eve was the first to respond, not even to the vinegar, to the shadow of jumping, to offer to embrace, Eve was the first killer, the body moves very fast, but someone faster than her.
As she moved, and as soon as she moved, she held her waist to the side, and the five coloured officers were filled with protest.
This is a woman.
Suman's eyebrows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I don't think of you at all," said Suman, his eyes cold, his voice soft, and his smell clean.
Worship the twelve, and if you can live with her, you must indeed worship her, otherwise how many people under heaven will be harmed by her.
"You're not nice," said Sue.
Eve protested, clapping white hands, indicating that he could let go. It was a very foolish decision to take him, unless there was no man in the castle to take him, she really did not want to take him.
"Suman," the little milk came, touching his lower jaw, "you are so unlikely."
Although I've heard of very human, but when I met know, really human, sophisticated, charming.
You too, little man.
Suman patted on his shoulder, with a soft look, "What's the matter with Eve?
Eve did not do it at first.What do you mean, Sue?
Truth is, I hate you.
She's my aunt.
"The world is small.
Suman's always cold eyes also flashed helplessly, turning and turning it is a group of people.
The little milk was introduced to them all, because Cheng Anja and Ye Three had little virus in them, and the two were just nodding, and Suman was not always happy to communicate with people, just as he was in his heart, nodding was a greeting, and so it was to the White Night.
"Well, how do you see so many people sick?" Suman said coldly, and all felt that there was a kind of invisible pressure spreading, and that it was someone who had such a spirit, that a simple word could have the effect of deterrence.
Miss Cheung, who seems to be a bit of a genius, is always a bit of a temper, of course, with the exception of their baby, anyway, they are both sure to come,
The rest don't care about them.
I don't think you don't?I don't know you don't have me.
"Yeah," he said.
Oh, are you sorry you didn't deserve to be a slave?
Eve smiled and touched Suman's arm, "Woman, do you really not want to be a slave?"
"I don't want," said Suman, with his cold eyes turned, and his eyes were filled with bitterness.
"Woman, don't do this. I'll be happy if you hug me."
All of them.
All the others had excuses, he said lightly at night, "Their two viruses are mine, and perhaps I can help.
"No," said Suman with a cold, convergent, fierce spirit.
The light night breezes, but as if there were a layer of frost between the eyebrows, and gently out of the heaviness, believe me, you will need.
Their eyes were touched together, one elegant, one cold and arrogant, and the spirit was not allowed to pass, and the people felt only a kind of pressure, extremely oppressive.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
You're not so good,but he's better than you are.
"I want the latest analysis," said Suman.
No No No No No.
Suman's eyes turned a little, and left him in the laboratory, and the rest of the people were not allowed to follow him, and all the people listened, and remained in the hall, said he at night.
said 11,He hadn't given a good look to the identity of Vivi and me at first.
"Oh, Vivi, how are you, but...
"The taste has changed a lot," he said, laughing.
She didn't understand what White had to say, and the little milk was smiling, and the eleven were inclined, and Y was waving, and she was speechless.
"It's an accident..."
"Is he an Arab?" he asked with curiosity at night.The Suman Five had an Arabian depth, and an Oriental depth, which was more like an Oriental in general.
His mother was an Arab, His father was a Chinese, a mixed-breed.

Levy leaned on a chair to drink ice and said slowly, You know why the slaves are up to the heart, So beautiful from the outside to the inside, you know, hard to see real man.
It's a pity people don't see her. According to inside news, Suman doesn't like women like men, so she's out of the game.
"Aunt, your charm is gone."
"The little boy," he said, "look at this man, who's lost his way to the north.
Where did it fall?
Levy pointed at the side of the ink, laughed at the charm, her charm shines to the ink.
"Woman," she asked, "you don't say he doesn't look like me, have you abandoned him before? Why do you want to be close to him?Womanman, you are lying to me."
Remembering is normal. Embracing is a basic ritual.
She hasn't gone to hug.
White Night and the little milk, the eleven cold hum, said Ye Wei very cooperative, "Do you see the eleven the ice hug who?
Don't want to live to hold her, how can you have a wife and eleven?
Fire and ice can't be pulled together.
"Woman, you'll be just like the eleven, without being too enthusiastic.
With my eyes lowered, in my depressedness, my purple eyes became dim, and there was no light.
Levy wasted her mind, and she was a little... uncomfortable with the manner in which she had always behaved, and, moreover, Suman was not interested in her, and she was a little bored, and there was nothing much to it.
"Vyvy, have you noticed that he seems to be getting smarter.
suddenly said,especially these days, it feels very obvious, not as it was at the beginning as white paper, what Ye Wei said.
Levy nodded. There was another concern. Was he going to recover soon?
Or?
Big White, did you remember anything? asked Ye, softly, with her head shaking, 11 and Ye looked at each other and did not speak.
Maybe it's a mistake!
"Woman, if you do this again, I will kill him."
Big White, go. I'll take you to see the sights of Riyadh.
Sheaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
This is a small study room.
Since Suman is a virus expert, the home laboratory has the most complete research equipment in the world, although the sparrows are all five dirty, look past, are test tubes, test agents, automatic equipment, computer graphic analysis, huge LCD screen.
Suman took the blood of the two, and injected them separately with two different colours, and there were only three, and the three leaves were not taken into account, and asked quietly, "Sir Su, can this virus really be solved?"
While Suman wasting his time on a system check, he said softly, "Maybe, maybe not, and I don't have the full idea, you have to see how the virus is unstable."
There was also one ready, looking at Cheng, smiling slightly, Che Chengng, smiling back at him, living and dying to their place, seems not to be so important.
Suman took a look at the perfect, perhaps because he had a good relationship with Nine, he had a good feeling for them, and his attitude was very gentle, after all, he could raise children like a small milk carton, and his parents would not be lazy.
Moreover, in the last few months, the events, the rumours, the world, quite dramatic, Suman knows that they are quiet parents, naturally also concern, and feels quite interesting.
Now to see them can face life and death, in the heart to appreciate.
"You call me Suman."
Suman's voice was always clear, and there was no emotion.
Chen, smiling, as he examined, and as he talked, asked, "Soman, how do you know Ning Ning?"
"It's a coincidence that he wants a picture of the weapon.
I didn't want to, who knows the computers at home are all black, I can't just compromise, I don't agree, I'm afraid he's even the nationality for free to help me change, wake up to be a national, say uncertain identity card spouse column will jump out a name.
said Suman.
Her parents,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My son's behavior is really...
You robber!
It was his son, thought Ying, and though it was dangerous, it was the most effective.
You're so miserable.
Miss Cheung shut up for half an hour, shut up for such a word, and at the exit regret, normally not as a parent, what do they have to apologize?
Miss!
"Well," I said, "I'm sorry."
Miss Cheung's attachment to the little milk bag had reached its limit.
"It's a good thing to happen occasionally. My son uses a lot of it.
Ye said, I don't feel any shame at all for the actions of the little packets, but I feel rather glorious.
"Yes," admitted Suman with a glance.
Miss Cheung and Miss Ying were a little successful, and Miss Yinging was very good, but it didn't matter how to know, it mattered that they were now forgetting their relationship,
Isn't that nice?
Suman checked for Miss Chang, his eyelids slightly raised, his cold eyes slightly passed, "I'm sure that's not the nature that's passed down, it's the nature that's passed down.
Thirty.
Miss
"But you're all right about one thing," said Suman, letting Miss Suman get up, and letting Miss Suman lie down.
When Suman checked the leaf, looking at the pictures and the information on the screen, his eyes sank, because it was Arabic, Chen did not understand, but the pictures were clear, it was the liver.
"It's a bit of a problem.
Suman.
With anxious forethought, "What's going on?
Isn't it saving?
"The virus has penetrated the liver. He is more serious than you are.
Mr Suman was telling the truth, he felt they were strong enough to bear the news, and he did not hide, "It's a cell virus, and once it invades the liver, the body will be severely depressed, and in less than a day, it will not be able to move freely, and it will only be able to survive in the laboratory with sedatives and oxygen masks.
Cheng Yan's eyes opened for a moment, the color faded, only felt the heart is sore, even the head is sore, a blank,
No matter what,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
She had a strong feeling that she was about to lose her leaves.
"Soman, what do you do?" "Soman, what do you do?" "Soman, what do you do?" "Soman, what do you do?" "What do you do?"
She reached out to hold her hand, and the cold touched her, and though she looked at death and death, she was sure that when the sun and the sun were gone, there would be pain and despair.
"Don't worry, little Anne," she said, "there's no hope."
He said softly, We're all talking, aren't we?
"The consequences are worse than I thought," he said, "and I'll do everything I can."
Suman said quietly, with his cold eyes fixed, "I'd rather ask him for something than ask him for anything.
Cheung Anya's mind wasted, somehow, Suman's speech is always to be believed.
"What about her?
"She's fine," said Suman. "She's in control for the time being," she said. "She's the first strain, and the virus is much more stable than you are, so she's in good shape.
"Why? I'm more addicted than he is.
It doesn't have much to do with poisoning.
"The instability of this type of cell virus is not so strong," Suman explained, "and the second-wave virus amplifies on the basis of its instability, making it easier for mutations to occur."
Joan did not really know about the virus, but when she saw Suman's sternness, her heart was healed, but she was not anxious or sad, and she accepted the bad news calmly.
"Yes, Suman, the designer of 1934 is your grandfather, and the principle of the night is similar to this
Are there any cures?
Soon asked.
Suman nodded, with a cold eye, almost untouchable, "It was studied by my grandfather when he was young, when my grandfather had liver cancer, and my grandfather studied cell viruses only to cure liver cancer.
It was locked in a laboratory, and no one knew, because he knew the dangers of the virus researched, but was stolen out by the students into the hands of illegals, causing the death of tens of thousands of people throughout Siberia, he regretted,
Afterwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although the same principle, this section is obviously more complicated, at present I have only an approximate idea, it must be confirmed before dare to test on you.
Li looked at Suman and smiled quietly, "You let go, I believe you.
The wife, I can't see him
Suman had a detailed inspection of the younger and the younger, and as the evening approached, he remained in the laboratory to prepare the information, and had the maids take them and the younger and the younger to the house.
Little Milk was waiting for them in the room for a longer time than in Rome. Little Milk was anxious and afraid of what would happen. If Suman had said nothing, it would have been estimated that no one in the world would have been able to save them.
As soon as they came back, their faces looked very pale, and the little chew washed up in their hearts, and they hurried forward, and the little chew was afraid that one would accidentally touch him, and that drinking would take him away, and the little chew was unwilling to leave a safe distance.
"Dad, Mum, you're all right," said Suman.
Little Milk was in a hurry, waited for an afternoon, lost patience, now only to hear the good news, even though he knew it was very little.
Shen Ya didn't hide from him, she said, but she didn't show the fear in her little chest.
"There's the world's best cow doctor and the world's best virus expert," he said.
Leth smiled a little, the little bottle showed calm, very great wind, he thought not only at the first time, that the child's performance, and not panic, but also busy to comfort the way father.
But...
Don't worry too much about what to do. If you believe in them, then believe in the end.
Whatever the result, I and your mother will accept.
Don't put on your face, it's awkward, your mommy's not dead yet.
Miss Cheung waved at her son's face, looking at her discomfort.
Impressed, her son must have been graceful and lovely, tightening her face in disbelief.
"You know," said the little milker, with his pink lips filled with discontent. "In any case, you must not leave me.
Miss Cheung smiled,I can't tell who just said,the best doctors and the best virus specialists are here,and it's going to be okay.How can you say no so quickly?
Don't have confidence?
Mummy, don't you break the baby like this. The little milk bag stared, and the little gentleman expressed dissatisfaction.
Miss Cheung smiled at Ying.
Little Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann
Mr. Le proposed that, because of his business relationship, he had come to Riyad twice, but that he had come and gone in a hurry, and had not come and looked at the beauty of the city, but had been impressed only by the night view of Riyad.
It's not enough to have a trip with three of us, it must feel good.
Besides the last time at the sea, their family has not traveled, nor knows he has not the opportunity to enjoy the warmth of a three.
He is very cherished.
"My baby," said Suman, "the specialty here is very well known," the little milk bag smiled gracefully, and cast a vote in favour, and the black eyes showed childishness.
The three little nod, to the son than good gesture, the father smiled at both.
Cheng Anya hesitated, her bright eyes were filled with fear, and she remembered the pain, which could not be expressed in words, which was very painful.
We're not good for the streets. Don't go.
She'd like to, said Ji, but things aren't allowed. There's always a physical collision in the street.
It's unthinkable to have a virus.
That's right too.
Even if the streets were wide, it would be safe to go to the streets of Riyadh.
Miss
Small Package
Don't set a bad example to your baby, Daddy.
Leth smiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The little bottle touched the nose and turned to smile, said one sincerely, Father, this is not the thing to say,
It's still important.
When Jian looked at the father, she was very cute.
Don't do that. drive. we don't get out of the car.
Joan laughed, baby, look, your old man is going to start a hard day tomorrow, you will have to work harder.
"Obey! "The little milk bag has a kind of military service.
Ye and Ming were not happy, and one afternoon disappeared, and when they had dinner, Suman came out of the laboratory, and the two men came up high, and Minginging one wife screamed so that all felt the food was very sweet.
There was a seat reserved for the two, and when they came they sat down, and the maid gave them food and drink, and when they went out at noon, the big white looked unhappy, but now he was glad, and his cheeks were red, and he seemed lovely.
Eleven, pulling Eve,,You got him? Didn't find anything?
In terms of compromise, Ye and the eleven best, the two did not even communicate eye to eye to know what the other did in a short time, Ye Ye shook his head, "all normal.
Because of their special relationship, Ye, no matter how they feel about, whether they love, they have a defense against him, no matter what they do, they must not interfere with the whole thing, so they are careful and normal.
It's just that's a fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake
Don't talk about strangers.
Her mind, always uncertain, how others see her is like the past, not half, and it is for this reason, the leaves and the white night to reassure her to see the ink.
What about my sister-in-law
Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y
"Good," said Suman, "and I'm not going to do anything about it."
"Aunt," said the little milk, "you're all happy. Remember my mother?"
Little children, eat more, talk less.
"Aunt," said Aunt, "have you been deceived?"
Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel
Every man, with his eyes, could see that it was no good.
Suman washed away the food in his dish, picked up the cold eyebrows slightly, and his eyes fell on his face, because he sat on the opposite side, and it seemed not strange that he could see with his eyes.
Strangely enough, Suman had seen it many times, and all were, except that the rest had felt.
Suman's sexuality, as Eve and Eleven know, was mentioned once on the plane.
Miss Chen's usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's awful for both men, especially now that the eyes are pure, the face is like a peach, the eyes are like a peach, the lips are like a peach, and it's a very good pet to have.
It was amusing for him to see that Y was not tired.
Soon in the minds of all flew out a very intertwined triangle of love, and the woman looked at the woman, and the woman looked at the woman, and the woman looked at the woman, and the woman looked at the woman, and the woman had pursued the woman for more than a year, and this time she had come running with the woman.
I didn't expect to bring me, but in a strange way to add to the enemy, the enemy called himself a wife.
Everyone is now thinking, how sad Eve should be.
The little bottle of ice coconut, the dark eyes turned and turned, floating on his aunt and his great-aunt, Suman, the more cunning the more cunning.
Levy slowly put down his fork, laughing at the so-called all kinds of mood, the single knife straight into, "So beautiful, do you see my house big white?
Suman looked calm, didn't pick up his eyebrows, talk.
She looked innocently at Y, afraid of Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y
Silence.
Miss Cheung took the tablecloth very gently, almost lying laughing on the table, the three little corners of the eye, laughing and feeling very thin, after all, Suman is the master, they are the guests.
The little bottle is drink coconut, is squeezed, turns in a direction, is still coughing.
"Haha"
"In a strange silence, the only one who laughed at the filming of the night, he was lively, indifferent to people, and this was the first time that he was in such a state of disbelief," said Suman.
As if he didn't know what he had done, he looked around innocently, "What is the matter with you?
Levy touched the head, comfort, she was deceived so many times by the Suman, never won one, not thought by the Suman as soon as the face of the face of the Suman.
Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good
It's all right, big white, you've done a good job, and it's worth it.
Eve great praise, Ming heard the wife praise, naturally smile not close the mouth.
"Vyvy," she said, "you've taught me a great thing."
Levy smiled and cried with a belly, Su, don't be ashamed, too. If you are thinking of a kiss for the slaves, the slaves will also be thinking of giving you a big hug.
All of them.
Lucky for you don't have anything to drink, Auntie, but you are strong.
Ye muster the feeling that had a sister, that his life would be perfect.
Miss Chen thought that her name was indeed a change, she had been conscious.
Suman's eyes were still cold, and his lips had a curve that could not be said to be a laugh, as if the autumn had been cleared, and the man's tone was flat, without any disturbance.
He is not a complete individual.
There was stillness.
Ying smiled and looked at ther, "Have you touched such a case?
"I did it a few years ago."
"Why is it?
"How do I know?" answered Suman, not coldly.
Levy washed her face, Sue, don't behave so rudely.
"I'd have been so rude.
Even if it's true, you don't have to be so straightforward.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
She still doesn't know what they are talking about.
"I don't know," said Suman.
Didn't you say there were cases?
The three leaves are also curious.
"It's not a disease," said Sue. "I don't know," she said.
Eleven is most interested in the other thing, can heal?
"I don't know."
How do you know when you ask three?
said White.
Levy glanced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Suman's cold eyes swept through the night.I'm afraid I don't know what to ask.
Everyone's silent. So beautiful. You're dead.
He's not a disease, he's not a normal, he's not a professional, he doesn't make any comparisons.
Suman Tea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
They laughed, and took a drink of red wine, and the people were silent.
It's awful.
Have you never heard of a complete individual?
It's more than talk. He's clearly a living man.
CHAPTER 374
After dinner, he drove away with Anya and a small pack of milk, and Sumanben wanted to have one as a guide, and he refused, and, while he was unfamiliar, he had a son who could never be lost.
He didn't want anybody to ruin the sweet time of their family.
The night scenery of Riyad is indeed very beautiful, away from the desert city flying a dozen years ago, now the skyscrapers of Riyadh, the streets are wide and bright, the city lights are lit, the whole city lights are lit, the feeling of a light sea.
As the car slowly passed through the city most belonged to the fountains, two fountains can be seen in a few streets, each with different designs, each with different sizes, and each with more cooling than the hot summer days.
"The Sahara is mostly in Saudi Arabia, and every green area in Riyadh has to be maintained manually, at a huge cost," said Leth, smiling. "These fountains are only for regulating the temperature of the city.
It was too hot for her, too. In the daytime, in Suman's residence, there was ice everywhere, and it was very cool. But as soon as I went out, there was a lot of heat, and Levy laughed and told her that 40 was the normal temperature, and that 45 was the hottest.
She understands why the streets of Riyadh are so empty, and normal people do not go out for a walk and a stroll at more than 40 degrees in the day and at more than 30 degrees in the night, and that is absolutely to blame.
There were too few people on the streets to take photographs when they were looking at no one, and though they were all hot and sweated, they were laughing, and they did not know that there was a storm over the Suman residence.
Suman went back to the laboratory after dinner, filled up with 1934 drug data, continued to study viruses, and the whole Noda laboratory was alone with him, and he was not surprised when Yves came.
How about a good night with you, So beautiful, So sweet, So soft, So boneless, So soft, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet.
Suman didn't blink, first, about himself, he wasn't as big as Y, but, second, the scenes of such embrace were too much, and he too was paralyzed.
Men's ink and silver belt, elegant, slowly tos down the rolls in his hand, cold pressed the eyes of the man on Eve, at least to dress professionally.
Levy laughed in silence, and took a look at Suman, and the more he had, the more he had, and the more he had, and the more he had, and the more he had, and the more he had.
"You know," he said.
Suman clapped her hand.
When will you be able to feel a lot of softness When will you be able to feel a lot of softness When will you be able to feel a lot of softness When will you be able to feel a lot of softness When will you be able to feel a lot of softness When will you be able to feel a lot of softness When will you be able to feel a lot of softness When will you be able to feel a lot of softness
"You didn't ask.
Suman grinned, indicating her rise. He hated such close contact with a woman.
Levy, with a grin around Suman's neck, Sue, if you're telling the slaves that you like men, that the slaves were changing sex for you, and now we're sure to be gods, you'll be breaking up a beautiful marriage,
Do you have to have a slave?
Suman wasted no time on YV's inconsistency, on the one hand, and on the other, reaffirming that is the nature of truth, on the other, "I don't like you, either, because you've become a man.
"Beautiful, don't take people with such a sex."
Why can't the beauty, Ye is very confused.
Don't let the old one down!
"Don't worry about something, I'm busy.
Suman washed, and the kind of non-violent and powerful spirit spread through the room, if the ordinary man had already been frightened by the softness of his legs; if it had been for Eve, it would have been no use at all, for she had experienced a more appalling atmosphere.
Do you know what I am looking for you garlic?
"Well, you're not going to turn the corner," he said. "You're not going to turn the corner again.
When Suman saw blood, though Eve had been with him for more than a year, he did not understand that there were many jokes.
After all, he accepted the two friends of Yev and 11, otherwise how could they have stayed at home so long, even if they were stronger, he would have driven the two men away, more or less.
What was I liked him? Levy admitted, with her heart uncovered, without any embarrasment or shyness at all, and she took a shot at Suman's chest, "Is he like that, two, or one?
"What do you think?
Suman replied,What do you care about?
"He's a black man, probably the man behind Louis, and what do I like about him?"
"I'm not sure," she said, with a smile. "It's just a plot."
Suman looked up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's a reasonable conclusion," said Eve, leaning down from the side of the chair. "I've counted people all my life, but I'm not going to be counted.
You're done, said Suman softly, with the warmth of an ice fountain, You love him.
Levy's smiled a little cruelly and aggressively, " Sue, do you think I should kill him?
Suman smiled,,I'm sure you won't let go.
"Laughter, I can't kill anyone in the world?"
YV also smile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm sure."
Suman said in silence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't say two, you can't go anywhere.
Levy waved, aren't you, I, you, 11, White Night, who of us isn't like that?
It's the same thing as before.
Susan looked at her, not speaking, and her dark eyes had a fearful penetration, and saw that Eve was a little disturbed, "You really don't know when he will be well
"I don't know," he said, "but there's no such thing as an example," and "even if I've met one, there's no such thing as an example of another."
Suman speaks.
Is there any way to keep him white forever?
What do you mean?
Let him do it forever.
Ye, it is not possible.
"You're too demanding," said Suman, with a very cold tone. "Now this sub-sexuality is a temporary occurrence, which doesn't last long. It's the original, it's the essence. Don't mess with it, it's like real and virtual.
"I don't care," I said. "Is there a way for him to keep it?"
She didn't like the present more than the old one, and she didn't know what the old one was, but she was worried that once the old one had returned, they were both over.
If it is, it is better to keep it.
Would you rather keep an empty shell?
Suman wondered that was not Eve, whom he knew to be unintelligent, and who would have taken such an extreme step for a man.
It's not an empty shell, but it's so cute now.
"No," said Suman adamantly, "the virtual soul will devour the original for too long in his body, and he will die in the end."
Levy's eyebrows twisted.
Will you die?
She breathed a little, her mouth pressed like a stone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Soman, I have a very unfortunate premonition," "that he is dead, that I am dead," "What do you say?"
"Do you want him or you?
"No," said the old man, "I'm not going to die."
That's the end?
Suman replied.
"OK," said Levy, with a smile on her face, "I understand."
Turn around and go out of the lab.
As soon as she went out, she came in the night, and Suman's eyes were dim, cold as a sword, as cold as iron, "What are you going to do?
There's the latest virus analysis over in Rome.
White Night answered lightly, looking at the direction of Eve, Are you sure you are not good at batting
"The duck would have played well. "
In the night,
Eve, sitting alone in the court, silent, had known not to go to Suman, the heart is extremely heavy, she has never been so hesitant in her life, looking at the moon, Eve's heart feels more restless.
M M M M
What should she do with him?
It's not clear what she's thinking now, and if she's back to her old, then they're not going to fight again.
When she thought of the pictures of the two men who killed you and me in the past, she was filled with a sense of helplessness.
If he had been white, it would have been unfair to them, and even life would have become fictitious, as Suman said.
It's what Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y
She won't behave towards the enemy, even if the enemy is a mermaid.
Kill him?
Don't go down?
Susan had a clear eye and could see everything, and if she had a fight with Meron, she would have done her best, but if she had killed him, she wouldn't have done it.
The beach was a living example.
If she were to kill him, she would not be able to kill him if she had returned to her previous life.
Kill, huh?
Levy wasted a moment.
It's a problem.
On a hot day, What are you wearing here? 11 beat her shoulder and sat by her side, Want to kill her?
"You're really the worm in my belly," Levy laughed. "I'm not trying to kill him.
One time the tiger returned to the mountain, almost killed her three brothers and her family, now that the virus in the lee three young and Cheng Anya did not know whether to dissolve, the small milk, though people are safe, Connono died, he also died.
If she had been on the beach at first, and had heard the eleven, and had killed the brothers of May, then nothing would have happened, and Louis would have taken them away, easy to say.
Now, she felt very clearly that was not right, the feeling in her heart was heavier and heavier, and all the spears were pointed at the brothers of the墨 family, and the墨 was by her side, and this was a good opportunity, and if it were lost, she would have no chance of killing the墨 for the rest of her life.
Their iniquity should be ended by them.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
"I can't say anything," said coldly. "You'll decide for yourself," said coldly.
"That's it."
Eve laughed, and in her heart, "It is true, so pure ink, how can I go to the hand?
"No," he said.
Vivi,you're really too deep.
There's been no news for so many days, and where did he go? said Ye Wei, and it's so unusual and worrying, that you said at the first time on the beach, he had almost lost his gun and his life, and now he's in our hands, and he's no trace. Isn's something strange about him, he's no reason to care for him.
"I'm surprised, too.
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
As murderers, their feelings are most sensitive.
Eve and 11 looked at each other, and did not speak at all, and the two sat again, and Eve returned to the house.
She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She
Levy sat down smiling at his lips, What to play?
"Game."
"I've got the monster," said Mr, giving her a look at what she had done.
It was a game, and she was relaxed, and the little fool, she looked at the ink, the color of the face, the pure smile.
It's like a child.
Who's really going to hurt a child?
Wife, why are you looking at me? She felt her eyes, paused the game, asked curiously, eyes are a little blank, what is the wife at all?
"It's all right," said Levy, leaning on the bed.
This little fool, how can his eyes be so pure?
"Woman, are you not very sad?"
She was lying next to Y, her eyes were a little sharp, "Who deceived his wife, tell big white, big white shattered him whole.
Angel.
"It's only the wife who cheats, and no one cheats the wife."
Ye Yang, Where do I look sad?
You know what hurts?
What's the heart?
"You look sad."
"Woman, do you really like that Suman?"
"Yes," he said.
What about me, big white?
You're different.
Ye smiled and clapped his cheek, "Don't whisper,
What do you care about Suman?
"I don't want you to like him.
"I like my brother,""I like 11,""I like my three sisters,""I like my friends more."
Sheaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Wife, you didn't mention me.
Their eyes looked as if they were being wronged, and their sleeves were like theirs.
Come on, I'll wash my face, and I'll talk to you for a while.
With a few clicks on the keyboard, the game was changed into another 3D graphic.
Drink?
Why did the brother let him drink?
She played on the keyboard, after drink, your wife will love more.
It's awful, isn't it?
Grandfather: Well, trust brother.
His eyes looked at the red wine, which the maid had just brought, and the wife had never let him drink, he curiously brought it.
Eva came out of the bathroom, and suddenly felt a change in the air, the interior is made of ice, separated from the outside cool, but she felt her heart half cold, she sat down along the bed, slowly swallowing down a glass of wine...
When was the wine here? She was astonished, but she saw her eyes lifted, and her purple eyes, cold and fierce, were filled with a kind of deceit.
Eve stood still for three seconds, raising her smile of all kinds, Hi, beauty, are you awake?

Levy's smiles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's beautiful but dangerous.
The two confronted, and no one spoke, as if they were stronger or weaker than they were in the air, and the two equally beautiful and dangerous eyes collided fiercely in the midst of the air, and a burning fire sprang up.
It feels too familiar.
It's like when they were in thermal waters, they were all evil, and they didn't care, and they wanted to put each other to death.
You want to kill me, don't you?
They were a kind of people, and since she had moved her heart to kill her, she knew that her real life would not be left to each other.
"Where is it?" asked hesitantly, his memories remaining on the island, and the scene in which Levy struck him with a rum bottle, for seven days, all his memories were blank.
He can't remember what happened when he was very white.
But he knew, according to his sharp observations and astonishing inferences, that Eve had escaped the danger, and that it was his help, or that on the island, even if the eleven were intact, neither of them could escape.
He knew that if he had a drink, he would have listened to those who saw him at first sight, so he would never let him touch the drink, and he had been born to become a fool by chance once, and three times, when he felt that he was white, he let him drink, and once, when he was very young, they broke in, and he let him drink, and then he went to the teacher to say goodbye.
Besides these five, this is the sixth.
She was sure she would not use him, and his brother was sure to temporarily leave Eve and 11 in order to protect him.
Saudi Arabia, Riyadh.
Levy smiled sweetly, with a ring,,You don't remember anything?

Eva is angry.
Though she felt more overwhelmed by hers, in these seven days, her little girl had no favour on him, and she had barely fallen into her bed, and she had barely been so kind, and she had barely been so tender,
Why doesn't he remember?
Levy was very uncertain, and said coldly, No!
"No need?"
She didn't hear?The girl's smile, becoming cold, has been tightened by a fire.
"I don't need this memory. "
Her eyes were cold, and a burst of fire was rising, and she was laughing, "No, you were only dreaming, and you woke up without any trace,
For a slave, it is not even a dream, it is not necessary to remember.
Their eyes were dim, their curtains were flickering, and the whole room was filled with terror.
The atmosphere is tight like a tight string.
Suddenly, as soon as he moved his foot, his shadow was like a ghost, and as soon as he blinked, he fled before her, and opened his five fingers, and straight took her throat, and the speed was great, and a wind swept through her, and she went back and forth, and her right foot was pushed up against the wall, and her body flipped,
After lying on the back, one leg sweeping to the spinal cord, the wind distinguished the direction, and did not turn,
He held back her wrists, stretching and pulling, as if the eagle had lost a chicken, and had thrown the whole man into the wall.
Oh, shit!
She had no time to breathe behind her. She lifted her hand, she held her hand on the wall, she kicked her feet up the wall, she avoided the hand wind that followed, she reached for the iron handle of the crystal lamp, she turned lightly, and she kicked her hand, forcing him to retreat.
Eve fell on the plane, a foot kicked the room wooden chair sweeping to Ming, and the people along, did not respond to him at all, who knows Ming's fist to the chair, huge impact force collided with each other, hard to break the chair.
Four.
There was a collision between the fist and the fist that came up, and at that moment the fist felt stiff, the tiger's mouth was sore, and the other hand opened, and grasped the hole in the fist of the fist of the fist, and twisted the fist of the fist of the fist of the fist of the fist, and twisted the fist of the fist, and twisted the fist, and twisted the fist the fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist
You can't beat me.
"I'm not," he said, "I'm not, I'm not."
A burning breath washed through her neck, her most familiar breath in seven days, and she smiled softly, Then let's try a harder heart.
She said, her elbow to the rear, she held her hand, she felt pain on the other side of her arm, and she twisted her hand, and kicked her back to his head.
At a moment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
There is only one leg.
Copper Bone.
"Yes, Sue, you have so much money to steal."
The chair was too uncomfortable, so it was scattered, it must have been stolen, and Eve threw the stick in her hand, and threw the punch on the face of the beautiful woman.
After two punches without being addicted, she was held by her hand, and she was beaten hard to the front, and the two figures instantly changed, and she was beaten hard on the wall by her hand, and she had no feeling, and on her chest, and on her belly, she had been beaten four or five times.
"Are you going to be like this?" "Are you going to be like this?" "Are you going to be like this?" "Are you going to be like this?" "Are you going to be like this?"
It's awful.
Compared to the first fight in the waterway, this time, the ink, the hand, the faster, the action proves, old man, I am harder than you, so you don't come and play harder with me.
A glance of the blood of the lip of the flower, like a lost rose, but stubbornly blossoms her beauty, stubbornly emits her charm, even if it is decayed in the decayed pride of the flower.
Why didn't he?
The Lady, laughing in a manner, lifted her hand, and swung at her, and her head flashed, and the Lady rose, and the other hand, from the side, swung at her face with a bloody hand.
With a gleam in her eyes,,This fist,This palm,This seven days, all of us have been deceived, and no one owes no one.
He wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was a little blood in the corner of his lips, and he looked up, and he looked coldly, and, as the wind was blowing again, there was none of the strength left in his chest, even a few strokes, and he was dead.
It's too cold.
Although she smiled, it was a dangerous smile.
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
This is a very clumsy way of wrestling, It's like everyone forgets they're all good wrestlers, It's like fighting on the streets, It's just not defending, You're hitting me, I'm hitting you.
The two, like a beast, whispered, the furniture of the whole room scattered scattered scattered scattered scattered scattered scattered scattered scattered scattered scattered.
There was nothing good about either of them, there was a shade, there was a shade of blue and purple, and it was unbearable, especially that of Ye Wei, which was like a blood-stained broken doll, but she was like an infinite force, able to stand so stubbornly against the ink, and to show no weakness.
It was so quiet, that Sooman and the eleven had come early in the morning, with the leaves and the young, and with the little milk.
By the time they arrived, Eve was riding on her body, beating one-on-one, the fierce white night and the three young watches all shivering, suddenly she kicked one foot fiercely to her abdomen, Eve fell behind her body, looked to fall on a shattered glass, 11 next to her, She was faster than her, pulling her hand cleverly, the two stood up from the ground, just standing steady, at the same time beating, the fists hit together fiercely, the two retreated at the same time.
Eleven pushed her waist forward, and she stood straight, and both breathed, and were confused.
Their faces were beaten so hard they could not bear it.
When all looked at the look of the black, they knew that he had returned to his original form.
When there is a day, there is a great difference.
"You're really hot. "It's a very strange thing to see Eve hit like this for the first time.
Despite watching the play, but the hand has been tight, ready to fight the state.
Levy laughed, like a blooded rose, "I'm a beauty, I can't beat you, how about a group?
Heh,You can try?
"Brother White, no.
M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M
A cold smile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He can't go.
He's gonna want to get out of here.
Chen, you've beaten him, but he's dead.
Virus, good weapon.
Raise your thumb at night. Good idea.
The Three Little Looks at Ye.
Suddenly, a tear from breaking the window, shot into the room, the glass instantly broke, the room rose up a white smoke, all came out of the room, closed the door, entered again, it was empty.
"It's old," said the little milk, "and since it's gone, it's futile to follow it again.
As her eye dropped, she covered her abdomen, and breathed blood again, and fell into her 11th womb.
"Vyvy...
Before he hurried, he did not dare touch her, and was in a hurry.
Leth looks at the night, the night...
"Go to my room first," said 11; then he took her by the bed at night, and went to 11's room.
She was afraid to see the past, but the little milk bag entered the room of Shev, She was afraid of her son's danger, and she could only stay, and the little milk bag escaped the full debris of the wood, and jumped to the bed.
"Well, what are you doing?" asked Ying in a low voice, and sat down curiously.
Everyone looked at the computer screen.
M: Drink?
M: After drink, your wife will love more.
M: Is there something like that?
Grandfather: Well, trust brother.
Miss Chang said nothing to the heavens, this is the myth of kidnapping?
"Yeah," said theraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprap
A game between a gray wolf and a white rabbit.
The Little White Rabbit must have lost.
"It's a great great great great great.
The little milk bag touch, hands on the keyboard hit several keys, suddenly the screen seemed to collapse, scream scream scream scream scream scream scream scream s
Finally stop at a place.
"Dad, do you remember when we came and saw a car park outside?" asked the little milk.
Leaves three little.
"It's there," he said.
Ying wasting to speak, suddenly a great pain in his arm, followed by a great pain in his liver, like a sharp silver needle, and a great pain in his limbs,
A convulsion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Achen..."
"Dad..."
Let's call Suman.
Jiang, said Jiang, the little milk bag jumped down, and hurried out.
"Achen, hold on, it will be all right."
De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De
His hands trembled in fear.
Isn't Suman saying he'll get sick tomorrow?
Is it too early?
"Oh..."
There was a sudden screaming, and there was a burst of blue on the forehead, and the finest five organs were twisted together, as if they had endured the pain of non-humans, and had gone beyond the limits... into a coma.
Chapter 376
The virus had developed early on, and she was in a panic, sitting like a needle, and she wanted to be with the three, and Suman suggested that she shouldn't go to the laboratory, and the beauty always spoke with a kind of dignity that could not be resisted, and even if she had been in a panic, she did not go to the laboratory.
Mummy, don't worry. Dad's gonna be okay.
Anya, the small pink face of different age of stability and firmness, he smiled gracefully, as if nothing had happened before, the lightness of which is admirable.
Baby, Mommy's not so good, and you're here to comfort, okay.
Miss Cheung knew her son best. She laughed and told him not to worry.
But, no more worry, she will take care of the son, not panic that even the son's emotions are free to shine.
What a pity it would have been if she had been frightened and comforted by a small packet of the same.
She's always been the most brave mom?
Both mother and daughter went to see YV. She was severely injured and unconscious. She had been checked early in the morning, and had been ordered to prepare for the medicine, and to give her the pain medication.
Joan looked at Yves and felt a bit of pain. She was injured so severely, and the night was quiet.
Isn't It's not worth it?
There was a drop of blood in Eve's room, and her clothes were bleeded, and when she saw it she was beaten and bleeded.
It's awful if you can get Eve into a coma.
It's all right. It'll take a few days.
She smiled at night, and gave her medicine.
Didn't you say there was some deep hatred between them, that they were all going to die?
He touched his chin at night, and he thought seriously, and it was very wrong, he said.
Are You Angry?
They never beat you to death.
said the eleventh, chill, she is now more curious about how suddenly it is, too suddenly,
When will she wake up at night?
"I'll almost wake up tomorrow morning.
said White Night, poking the shoulder of the eleventh, said the eleventh, did the eleventh really fall in?
What do you say?
Was she in love with her big white brother or was she beautiful?
Think about it.It's supposed to be beautiful.
"Why?" asked the eleventh and the twilight, thinking in the twilight, "Be quiet, my dear, and you know what it is to love."
"How do you feel?
said the little milk, such a character as to invite to see her, big white?
After he became a fool, Eve would follow him at will, if she had replaced someone, she would have thrown away.
That's not the reason.
Poor Vivi.
Looking at her wounds at night, she sighed as if she were dressed, and laughing as if she were dressed, she said, "I'm a little expecting how she's taken such a strong ink and beauty.
Miss Cheung, who kept silent, couldn't help crying,I've always been confused, isn't there a difference between big white and ink? isn't it one person?
Mummy, it's pretty easy, too much too much too?The little milkshake objected, agreeing at night, agreeing at night, and they'd just taken them as one.
A demon. an angel.

"No," said the father, "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's not hard to get through," "sometimes it's not hard to get through," "sometimes it's not hard to get through," "sometimes it's not hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard
"It's all one," said Jian, smiling at his point of view.
It's different.
The same.
Mummy, three to one, few to many, you lose, don't struggle.

It seemed to see what she was thinking, and the little bun laughed again, "Mommy, democratic choice, have you ever seen a real democracy?
You say society harmony, when has society harmony?
White Night, Eleven up thumb, strong, just one word.
"You're a big man. don't behave like a weak woman.
Small Package
Some laughed away from Room 11, and at night laughed, "It's really a great mother.
"Their house is exquisite.
No No No No No No No No No No No
"Mr Su," said the master, "I ask you to go to the laboratory."
When the maid came hurriedly to ask for the night, all of them were astonished.
What's wrong?
"Suman let the night go to the lab."
Little Chew explains, Chew's mind is sinking, is not Achen's situation worse? heart pounding, Chew's face suddenly become extremely difficult to see.
She was sitting alone in the court, and the little lamb would have liked to accompany her, but it was too late for him, and the little lamb could only go back to rest.
It was also hot in the evenings, there was almost no wind, and the temperature outside was unbearable, and even in shorts it was unbearable.
Joan, however, unexpectedly had her limbs frozen, a thin layer of cold sweat on her forehead, and did not feel any warmth.
Cold.
It was cold coming from inside out, and it felt like Louis had told her she had a virus, and they were waiting for the leaves to come.
It's very scary.
It was late in the evening, she wanted to look at the laboratory several times, but did not dare to approach, what the virus looked like at the time of the attack, she knew.
When she got sick, she had a hard time, but she didn't get much, and Louis gave her anesthesia to relieve the pain,
But when she saw Zhangpo in that little house, she bled her head, because it was too painful to choose to die.
The more I remembered the tragedy before Zhang Po's death, the cooler the body felt, the faster the heart jumped, the unhappy premonition hit again on the head.
It was a quiet night, with only the fountain of the courtyard, the sound of the fountain of the courtyard, which used to sound like a calm, but this night it seems to be a disturbing.
She went for a while in the court, and sat down, and pondered, and all seemed to be very quiet, as if in the darkness, so quiet that there was no ordinary.
Halfway, she stood up, as if to make a decision, to the direction of the study.
The closer, the more terrifying, She was afraid to hear the rustle of leaves, Surprisingly, but quietly, Cheng Anya comforted herself, perhaps nothing, The white-night medicine was so high, and Suman was a virus expert, which was not the same as Zhang Po,
Maybe there's a turn. She doesn't scare herself.
She steered away from the door of the study and walked straight into it.
White Night recorded and studied the data on the screen, the first to find Cheng Anya, he picked up the eyebrow, "Anya, how come?
Suman was testing two doses without raising his head, and analyzing the compounds with microscopes, very seriously and without hesitation, said Jiang.
I'm not going to quarrel with you, I'll just go with him.
He looked at the leaves at night, and nodded.
The whole laboratory is not very large, but the equipment is very complete, it feels here is a very modern research center, like the scenes in the movie.
On the operating room,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He held his hand with his eyes, but he found a trace of blood on the floor, and he looked under his eyes, and there was a large piece of blood under his feet, and he looked at his arms, where they were held tightly.
For reasons of struggle, there are two circles very obvious wounds, blood flowing.
Suddenly, she bit her lower lip, holding the acid in her eyes, she could imagine how he struggled, and how he hurt himself.
He must have tried to get out.
Achen
Separated from her coat, she held his hand, and she looked at the fallen leaves, and in her heart was a sudden pain, and she wanted to cry, but could not; she could not cry, and he would surely be well.
There is a good there is a person to be recompensed is Louis, not to be tormented, to be tormented in life.
Achen, don't worry,I'll be with you always.
Even if you go to hell, I'll be with you, and I'll never leave you alone.
She remembered her earlier pledge that from now on she would be Shen's guardian, but she did not fulfil her pledge, but she nearly killed him.
What kind of guardian is she?
It's pretty.
Jiang wasted a little, holding tightly the three leaves, biting his lips to withstand the tears that were coming, but accompanied him quietly.
Leth fell asleep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's good to be alive.
He's alive for a second She's with him He's alive for a day She's with him a day.
Chapter 377
Joan had been accompanying her to the laboratory until late in the night, when she gave her tranquilizer and fell asleep, in the laboratory only the sound of electrical instruments flashing, and the sound of the test tubes touching, and the reaction of the test tubes, was very quiet.
She did what she had promised, and though she had no more fear in her heart, she did not go to fight with Suman at night, and she was afraid of affecting their work.
Two men,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She sat quietly with the three, very tired, but without trouble, looking openly at his face, occasionally looking up at White Night and Suman, judging from their colours the progress of things.
Later, the night seemed to have passed, "Anya, you go back to rest, and the leaf tries to give you a tranquilizer, and you won't wake up until we give you a solution, and you'll be fine here too."
It's okay, I'm not tired.
She insisted on heritage.
"I'm not afraid of you're tired, but I'm afraid that your viral instability is increasing and that you're going to get sick early."
Zhang opened her mouth without saying anything, and still held her hands, and refused to let go; she knew that she was right, but she did not want to leave.
"You can't stay with him for days or nights without eating or sleeping.
' said White Night, 'I'd rather this mother be more stubborn than Vivi.' 'It's hard to say,' he said. 'I'm sure she's more stubborn than Vivi.'
"Wait a second.
She had nothing to do with her return, she said.
She shook her head at night, and when she was tired, she would go.
He really doesn't understand what love is, why a wise man can become dumb, and choose such dumb acts, it doesn't help at all.
White Night gave Suman the good data to exchange Suman's test data.
Suman put the information on one side of the table, cold eyes, the whole laboratory like to bring a cold wind, he said coldly, There are women in my mind, do half the work.
In the night,
Sweetie,you're pretty!
That's what's been said, that's what's been said, that's what's been said, that's what's been said, that's what's been said, that's what's been said.
Maybe that's the way it is.
Otherwise I wouldn't have avoided a beauty like Vivi.
Joan stood up slowly, her lips twitched, angrily wanting to beat the table, "So beautiful, don't do this kind of gender discrimination.
Su's face,,I'm a sex discrimination You can take what I'm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss
Go, Suman said not to see a woman, I'm tired, she can't stay, people work twice as hard as little, research does not solve is big, whether it's fake, she really can't stay in the lab anymore.
Raise your thumb at night.
Susan looked back, hum, continued to work, because time is more urgent, and at night there is no time to bite, continued to analyze the data before the screen.
This was one of the most difficult problems he had ever encountered as a doctor, and he had to concentrate very much on his head or he would not be able to follow Suman's pace.
There is also competition, it is inevitable, the beauty from the beginning is an exaggerated kiss, and the alleged disdain of all the attitudes is very uncomfortable, the white-night pride, who is called the genius doctor, who will be such disdain, now is the strength to give him the heart.
His reputation as a genius is not a game.
So beautiful, I curse you to be planted in the hands of a woman.
Cheng Yan Yan.
Wouldn't a person be waiting for a woman?
When I first heard of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Earth is a little bit occupied by a corrupt woman, who thinks she has been on the Internet for many years, knows a corrupt wolf, a corrupt woman, a corrupt woman, a corrupt woman, a corrupt woman, a corrupt woman, a corrupt woman, a corrupt woman, a corrupt woman.
It's really uncomfortable to feel like you're being disrespected.
Suddenly, a picture floated in my mind. It was often said, An orphan or a widow, living in a room must not be cleaned by fire, but what if an orphan or a widow?
In particular, one of the orphans is still bent,,,,,,,,,,,,,...
Miss Cheung washed away in the wind.
Oh Oh Oh
She must have been ill to have such an association, Su is the cold look of the murderer of me, and the eyes of the others are the heavens and the earth, but I am the only arrogant, holy and dusty, and at a glance I feel defiled the spirit of the gods, how can I have sex with the white night?
All he's doing is sex discrimination is stimulating her thinking is spreading, thinking.
O O O O.
The days passed quickly, and within seven days, Ye Wei's wounds were healed, her face could not be seen any more, and she was completely restored to her original condition, and it was too soon for the little doll to claim that her aunt was a dead cockroach.
The last time I wasted my hands very quickly, this time too.
Thought she might have a feeling of loss, she had been smiling like a flower since she was awake, and her manners and actions were no different from the past, and she could not see any difference, as if she had never met a flower like a flower.
She didn't mention one of her beauties or one of her big white brothers, it felt like that person had disappeared from her world, there was nothing to mention, the first terrorist organization had some work to do, they hadn't been managers, and Evey and 11 were staying in Riyadh.
During this time, the outside was also calm, the only smoke was Melanie, who was angry and red-eyed, leading the first terrorist organization's most sophisticated air force in the desert to surround Prince William of r.
After all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The old man has time to spend with you, to see who spends more.
Such a barbaric and aggressive act, indeed only the terrorists have done, to the extent of the blackness of Chu's belly, to cut off the water source has been the lightest, rather than to estimate the face, the war will be more distorted and terrible.
In this regard, Lin's officials won, and people were also released, the city's top officials personally confirmed, misunderstood one, and the situation of Tang four also gradually recovered in good,
There are also people in the town.
On the one hand, he was involved in the affairs of Longmen in North America, and on the other hand, he was in contact with the terrorists and was ready to increase his support for Chu's departure, in addition to responding to the siege and suppression by several major government forces, such as the Spanish and Italian governments.
The Small Pack is a suggestion to move the power of the Middle East, to avoid the front, because it is clear that the move is a provocation to the r countries, and that the neighboring countries, whether willing or unwilling, are coming out to help, and no one is coming out to protest.
In addition to the recent clashes with the Black Party have shocked many people. In short, all the countries are coming and trying to use this opportunity to weaken the power of the first terrorist organization.
I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing
Unlike this man always style, most small countries are really only dare to speak, dare to act.
When the First Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror
Who knows, theft seems to have disappeared, except for a few small-scale military operations in the Middle East involving government troops.
It was awkward to find out that Louis was only trying to lobby the authorities for a murderer with a knife, and that was why there was such a mess.
The eleven pointed out that was not the way Louis had always been.
Eve agrees, that they had little to do with the Black Party, but that would not be the way Louis had always been, nor would he be so low as to kill with a knife.
Will it be the brother?
Suddenly, she asked, these days she has often seen and discussed these things with them, and she herself has a general understanding.
"What are they going to do?" said Ye, pointing out the problem, and not even the little packet could understand it.
"The united government will not be long."
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
War is a dead enemy of terror.
Chapter 378.

This was the first terrorist organization in history, and one of the most extensive military operations in history. The anti-terrorist organizations had been fighting for a long time, and they were beginning to put an arrest on the island, and this time they were threatening to be very good relations between the countries and the countries of South America and South America.
The biggest was the dissolution of the coalition government this time.
If they were tos their feet, the most likely outcome would be a burning of stone in order to rescue the country and keep the peace, the best way to deal with it would be to disband the government army and to plan this resentment for the private resentment of Chu and Prince William, who are fighting and cheating on women.
Only then can peace be maintained.
"It takes half a month to see the situation," he said. "It's better to use your own relationship to shake up the black party."
The little bottle touched his lower lip and laughed, and he wanted to come to see a crab fight.
But a man is a wise man. You have to count him, but it's not easy.
11 agree, "You want to get the chief to do business, you have to pay the same for it, and you have to see if he wants to catch someone, or if he wants to break the case, or you can not ask him.
"It's a lot of business," he said, "but it's not going to look like this, it's going to look like what we want and we'd rather say it."
Levy laughed,But if Chu had to get back to the beauty,then he wouldn't have been able to cope with an attack by the gang.
"I think it will be a few days," said the little bottle, touching his nose.
Aunt, do you want to know about the great white aunt?
"The slaves are looking forward to hearing from him," said Eve, smiling in all manner of ways, playing with the glass of light in her hand.
It's like a big white thing, and it doesn't have any effect on her.
Joan laughed, "Vi, don't behave, you can beat him."
It's absolutely true. She's been beaten right now, she's afraid, she's really thinking about giving her eight, but the power is there, she has to admit, she's really too strong.
Ying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes, Eleven.
It's cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold cold
With a smile, like a spring wind, like a blossoming flower, pure, bright eyes hiding a smile, he asked innocently, Wei, do you not have a gun?
Why do it?
Little Cheese Laugh, Mom, correct,
You're too strong. He's always a bloodsucker, but he laughs innocuous.
The 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 12 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 18 19 19 20 21 22 22 23 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 29 30 31 32 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 56 57 58 58 59 59 62 62 63 63 63 63 63 64 64 65 69 70 70 80 81 82 82 82 83 83 84 84 84 85 85 86 87 83 84 84 84 85 86 86 87 87 87 88 88 89 89 89 89 90 90 90 90 91 92 93 94 94 94 94 94 95 95 95 95 96 97 97 98 98 98 98 97 98 98 98 98 98 98 98 98 98 98 99 99 99 98 98 98 98 98 98 98 99 99 99 99 98 98 98 98 98 98 98 99 99 99 99 98 98 98 98 98 98 98 99 99 99 99 98 98 98
Eve wants to kill him.
That day she saw with her eyes her hand pressed to the handle, but it never came out. Although the action was like lightning, it was not a fake of many years, and she was the next step in every action of the fight.
They've been shot so they haven't been shot. What's that gonna mean?
Their acquaintance, Ye, would have preferred to put a man to death and it would not have been possible for him to get a punch, but the result was that he was beaten half to death.
Levy's face doesn't change, smiles go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go
Little Couple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,you know what people do with their tactics?
"Well, you shouldn't have shot at Achen at first, and you should have looked closely at his weaknesses," he said.
Isn't it
"My sister, how are you? Oh, my brother, if you beat me, make sure you don't recognize his face."
Joan laughed, and did not continue to ask.
The Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine
So, what's ink, what's big white, roll aside.
A pair of calm eyes.
"Are there any signs of being awake?" she asked suddenly. "She hasn't been to the laboratory, and she's been injured for several days.
De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De
But she knew that's not when she woke up.
This virus is too strong.
"No," said Suman, "as long as he's been developing solvents, he's been doing it, with nutrients and tranquilizers, and with all sorts of things that I don't know how to do."
It's awful.
Eve had some heartache, and if it were to say who is the one she loves most in the world, it is definitely not the big white, nor the black black, but the three.
So did Jian, who knew that was the life force of Ying three day by day, that the seven days had passed for days, and that he could only keep his pulse on these drugs.
Though she had a heart, she had nothing to do, but she was in danger.
"Mommymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymy
"There's me in this world," said the little milk, smiling gracefully. "My father won't let go of me, or my mother will marry me, and he will jump out of the coffin as a ghost."
Ye and Cheng An Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
There must have been a lot to do with 11 and with Levy before they left Levy, but Levy insisted on staying, and no matter what went on outside, Levy was always quiet, and there were not many people to guard, and they were both responsible for the safety of Levy's three.
The last time they lost their jobs and this time they were not going to leave, and history was not going to repeat itself on them.
Eleven suddenly asked,,Anya,you say that Louis can touch you,that his blood can cure the poison?
White Night also spoke of this, and if we had his blood, it would have been quicker, but Louis must have thought, that he had no trace, that he could not be found at all, said Joan.
When it came to Louis, she was still terrified.
"Where did he go? I always thought it was the calm before the storm, and there must be something going on.
Mommy, don't think too much about the last thing, and don't do it again.
Though there were not many people, the Suman's house was not to be destroyed, nor was it to be seen from outside, nor to be approached, nor was it to be seen from outside.
It's a stronghold, it's safe to go out and in.
"I'm not worried about this," he said.
"My sister, I'm curious, why don't you have a virus?"
"Well, if you count the days, then there are days left for the month, and even if there are no days left for the death, then the virus should start sooner.
"I don't know.
She's all right these days, She's all right, She's all right, She's all right, She's all right, She's all right, She's all right, She's all right.
She was lying on the operating room, not waiting to die, but to wake up.
"Well, I'm too bored.
"Of course, Mom," said the little milk, smiling, and then, with a lovely finger, "I don't think you're crazy.
"You must be a stranger.
Everybody laughed..................................................................................................
As soon as they came back, they surrounded them at once.
Susan's face looked very bad, though she looked very tired, her cheeks were a little red, and in her cold eyes, the flame jumped, and she couldn't help but hold her arm.
What's wrong?
So, So, So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So
Hiddenly, she missed a good play.
"So beautiful," "Is the medicine out?"
What about Achen?
Tomorrow.

Waving his hands at night, he sat down and drank a cup of tea before he said, It's still not good enough, let's see tomorrow.
Jiang's heart suddenly dropped, looking at their faces, she thought hopeless, didn't know when to wait, didn't think it was good news.
Her pale face turned red, her eyes turned red, and though she hadn't seen anything in the past these days in front of the little milk, only she knew that at night she was worried she wouldn't be able to sleep, and she stared at the direction of the laboratory.
I prayed to the Lord more than a hundred times, only to ask him to be in peace.
That's good.
The baby's face is happy, the child's nervous mood is also relieved.
Suman rubbed his head slightly, and his mouth a little softer, Don't you worry about it?
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
"Don't worry.
Little Milk laughed, and looked at Suman, and looked at the very dim white night, and he felt a little strange, acutely, "Suman, white night, since it is good news, what have you done with the scary face when you have just come.
That's not right.
What to say, Suman glanced past, raised his hand, smiled, put a mouth on, and continued to drink tea.
It was a strange thing, that Eve's eyes were turning in the darkness and in the darkness of Suman's face, and that, in fact, they were unanimous in ignoring the fingerprints of the darkness's face, and even the little milk bag.
There was a silence in the hall.
The beauty hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum
When he smiled, all thought that Suman's next move would be to kill him, who knew that his cold eyes were sweeping through the night, and brushing his sleeves.
Everyone looked at his back.
What's happened?
The little milk bag jumped into the white night, the little palm on the handprint, the dark eyes blink blink, "White night, what about your face?
"To mosquitoes," said the man, "the mosquitoes are more in summer than in summer."
White Night laughed, put down the cup, and rubbed the head of the small milk bag is extremely sad, Why do people like to touch his head?
Ye shuttered her eyes, and the little milk bag compared his fingers and fingerprints, in truth, to testify, "White night, your fingers don't seem so thin.
Their eyes were fixed on the white face.
Put on a white face, seeking the truth.
Knowing that the virus was about to be solved, Jian's heart was relaxed a lot, and couldn't help paying attention to such a beautiful handprint on the face of the white night, and hit it really well, it's very useful.
Look at the master's hand is very beautiful.
"Don't behave," said Suman.
Eve laughed with a little danger, the expression, supposing to bite the teeth, very correct.
Why did he beat you?
What have you done?
Wouldn't you be rude?
Everyone almost unanimously expressed their doubts.
Put down the cup at night very gently, "I'm tired, go back to sleep.
Everybody looked at the back of the white night tree, and thought of Suman so cold as to make people look, and smelled of rape.
Eve grieved and clapped, "No, you don't have to bend like this..."
CHAPTER 379
The beauty with her claws, wanted to hurry up to tear the beef with the hands of the white night, the gorgeous five organs twisted together, look like a special terror, like a supernatural ghost.
The little milk bag seems to have seen the beauty of the long hair flying like a terror.
Miss Cheung smiled softly, but her eyes could not conceal the laughter, and as soon as anyone saw it, the beautiful woman went away.
As for her genius, she was the strongest. Fortunately, she didn't turn her head when she heard it at night.
Aunt, I have a question, what is the bend?
Miss Cheung's smile twisted and stiff, 11 eyes eyes nose, still as a mountain, Levy turned her head, gently clapped the head of Nanning, language of long learning, "Dear child, after all, you must not be bent, do not need to know.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk

Yee said in a true way.

Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak
Is it possible to have a better mind than Suman?
This woman is hiding more and more.
"What kind of onion is he more than the beauty of Sue
I'm really hit.I'm sorry.You're all different from me.
It's too much.
Do You Need Compassion
Joan was very interested in the play. It is normal for you to run.
Yes indeed!
For a moment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even though Sue's reaction isn't very nice, at least there's a reaction, isn't there, or is it so fierce that if you're a street man, you're going to be like a light-headed king?
It's impossible.
"My three sisters, 11, is the beauty just turned red?" she asked, with more twisted laugh.
"Suspect, yes."
Miss Cheokokokokokokokokokokokokok
Levy's eyes blinked, not as the two women had gone, but as she touched her chin, "Why?
"Why?
Eve turned her white eyes and said, Do you like women? Do you like men? Then the solitary man and the widow should be together, and it would be dangerous if they were alone.
Why is it so late in the night, so beautiful?
"Oh, yes.
Miss Cheung thought as well, hadn't thought very much, and when Ye came forward she felt a little strange,
How else do you get a hand?
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
But are they that is so shallow, that they have known it for ten years, and that they have not seen it in any way, and that they know the nature of it
This can't be done.
He's not a woman, and more than that, a man.
"Why?
Jian thinks so too, that man, though he looks gentle and elegant, is in fact very vague, giving a feeling of being very far away, like a floating cloud.
You shouldn't do this. If you change Yechen, you can do this thing, and at night you shouldn't.
Then why should we shake hands at night?
She asked again, and the three women looked at each other, and had doubts in their eyes.
"You should eat tofu," said 11, "but it's not like that," he said.
That's not possible.
Miss Chen also turned her head, very suspicious.
Isn't the White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White
"If Suman had been, he would have been on the other side of the night, and then sent him to Yan, would he have simply given him one hand?"
He said coldly, "I'll take a deep look at Su's distorted personality."
Besides, there is Achen in the laboratory.
The three remained silent again, and the little bottle lifted her hand weakly, "Are you going to think I am here too?
Why are you still here, when we are talking about something that is not good for children?
Miss Cheung stared at him, as if you were not going.You heard that it was your fault, and it was not about us.
"The correct answer. "
"I agree."
Little Milk Pack
Oh, woman, it's a terrible creature, but it's his best Nono.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Eve went away completely and turned to the court.
The shadow feels like it's just floating away, looking at something special and scary.
It's dinner.
Everybody was together, Miss Cheung, Ye Wei, 11, and the little milk bag, four eyes floating constantly on the white night and Suman, and the expressions were all a little corrected.
Miss Cheung is a well-known delay wolf. Knowing that the cure has hope, the heart is extremely relaxed, naturally has leisure to consume others.
In fact, from the eyes of her long time in the beauty world, White and Suman are absolutely matching pair, Suman white dress over the snow, cold arrogance, White White Trees in the wind, handsome and handsome.
The two are hard to see good look, stand together very eye, very goddess couple.
She's the hottest.
The applause on the face of the white night after an afternoon has gone away, now the breeze lightly eat, to all the unanimous attention, very humble acceptance.
That's not a common man's strength.
Eve leaned closer to Suman, laughing and asking, Su, beauty, to the hair of our brother at night?
White Night Brother?
As soon as everyone shook their eyes.
There's nothing to say, don't behave like that,' said Eve, cutting on Sue's sleeves.'Isn't our brother at night beating you?I'll beat him for you, and I know you can beat him.
It's okay. I've done it.
Don't worry.
Suman hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum
"Don't worry," I said. "I don't see him. I've been trying to beat him.
There's nothing to worry about.
Ye continued to laugh.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
"Well then," he said.
No matter what she said, she was told the truth by the beauty, and she felt that her mouth was too tight, and that it was impossible to find out the secrets of the night.
"You are too busy to entertain the public.
No No No No No No No No.
Yves protested.
I agree.
Miss Chang continued to eat, to keep the small milk bag out of the fire, to avoid harm to the pond.
"Brother of the Night, are you right?"
Ye, with a wink, asked innocently, "I remember last year the Miss of the World was around you, Russian, and I have seen you kiss,
Should it be straight?
For a moment in the darkness, a glance at the brows, "You are really devils,
Can you see it?
"I'll say that image is you, indeed.
Levy smiled, Since it is straight I can rest assured, Don't cheat Sue.
She smiled at night, and as if she were all right, she said to Miss, "You must rest early, take blood tomorrow, and do not eat before you go into the laboratory.
He said, Get up and go.
All looked at his dish, and barely moved.
"The last medicine is my blood," answered Jian.
No No No No No No No No
She had no doubt that was said at dawn, and that his speech was easy and sure, and she should have left half of her heart.
"The blood of my three sisters," I thought, "the blood of Louis."
Ying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I'm thinking of him.
"There should be an eight percent."
"Yes, white night, why hasn't the three sisters got the virus?
She looks like a normal. Why is she so serious?
asked Eve curiously.
"It's not surprising that virus is much more stable than the second one, and even with a month and a few more days, I've given her anesthesia, and I've given her more than ten days, so the virus is under control," he said.
He smiled softly at night.
That's what it is.
Zhang no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11 She looked at the white dish, and it was empty, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, she looked at it looked at it, she looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at the look at the look at looking at the look at looking at the look at looking at looking at the look at looking at looking at the look at looking at looking at the look at looking at looking at looking at the look at looking at looking at looking at looking at the look at
You're not feeling well, you're not feeling well, you're not feeling well well, you're not feeling well well, you're not feeling well, you're not feeling well, you're not feeling well, you're not feeling well, you're not feeling well.
"What did you do to people? " "It's a strange thing to do to a man."
Several eyes were fixed on the face of the night, the light smile of the night, "no telling.
We haven't been moving for a long time.
Eve twisted her arm and laughed threateningly, 11 said he had received the message, that he could be active at night, suppressed by force, to see if he did not say.
Raise your hand at night. He has a gold medal.
All of them.
Well, cut off your legs, sit in a wheelchair as if to cure the poison, it's just your brain and not your feet.
"Aunt, you are cruel!"
Raise Your Thumb.
Their servants gave them Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo
Levy laughed with his head up, sister Dena, your little mouth is getting sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter.
Miss Vivi, she smiled, with only a pair of shiny, dark eyes, shy and frightened, very beautiful, though it is not clear what she looks like, but it is clear from these eyes that she is absolutely beautiful.
Levy laugh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides, it is a good thing sent by the princess.
"It tastes a little strange.
Miss Cheokokokokokokokokokokok.
Come on, it smells good, said the little milk.
When Diana had a bowl, and put it in front of her, she felt a diarrhea, but because they were all, and not too rude, she had to endure, and the smell kept going, she really couldn't resist, and she covered her mouth and ran out of the dining room, and it was not enough to vomit...
As Diana and others were in astonishment, the little milk bag and Levy hurriedly dropped the bowl chopsticks and pursued out, Cheng Anja was holding the column and vomiting, and all faces looked at each other.
"Mom, are you feeling sick?"
"How are you, sister?"
Jiang Yang wasting, stopped for a long time, the whole thing was a little flouting.
With his eyes twisted at night, after he had finished, he had to give her blood, and he laughed, "It's all right, it's all right, I'm probably not used to the taste.
Take your hands out.The white night, with a gentle smile, She reached out with her hands, and the white night covered her with a thin sheet of paper, and looked at her in a strange way.
The little bottle wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not a virus.
murmured at night,She's pregnant.
CHAPTER 380 Do you want children?
Pregnant?
With her eyes wide open, and her mind blank, as if she had been shattered by lightning, she was shocked.
It's like hearing about aliens taking over Earth.
White Night was a little strange, a little unbelievable, a few strokes of the vein, finally confirmed, eyes looked strangely, as if pondering what.
"Good night,""You're not wrong,""The three sisters are pregnant,""They jumped two planes on the way to their escape,""If the pregnant child had already disappeared,"
How is it possible to be alive?
Ye also felt in the way there is no less excitement,
Is this kid too old, or...
11))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
She's pregnant, she said, with a bit of astonishment, looking at her, still in astonishment, and not slowing for half an hour,
He sat in silence, as if a pregnancy had nothing to do with her.
Everyone looked at each other, and at one time did not know what to say.
The little bottle of milk wavered in front of her, and she came back, a little pale,
"The boy..."
Eve and others saw her in this way and thought, This child should not be Louis, if it were indeed Louis, it would be enough.
It's complicated.
Lewis had her for so many days, and he would have touched her freely, and no one would have wondered what would have done with her.
It looks like pregnancy isn't long. It's a reasonable inference.
There was some strangeness in the look of Anya, and she and the eleven could not help but look away, and the little milk bag looked quietly at his mother.
It's less than two weeks, and it's about ten days," said the white night, more strange than that.
"What?" cried Eve, her eyes suddenly turning strange, her lips squeaking, "Doesn't he have a color?"
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
In addition to wearing gloves and avoiding physical contact with her, everyone agreed that they collided with each other when jumping in the desert, and then infected with the virus.
But the truth looks like a thunderbolt.
It's easy to relate to what, Chen's face couldn't resist a red, I'm a bit sorry, Wei, you too direct?
11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 18 19 19 20 21 22 23 23 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 34 35 36 37 37 38 38 39 39 44 44 44 44 46 46 47 47 47 48 48 48 49 49 49 50 51 52 53 53 54 54 54 53 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54
Ye was very gentle, said the old man, The peonies die, and the devils are the wind.
It's really brave. It's full of sperm.
What a fool!
She always knows what happens when a beauty doesn't die.
It's not what you think.
Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang
Then Miss Cheng wasted her time.
Well, since it's all that's what it's all about, anyway, it's all about being so brave, she didn't say, the more black she had, she said.
How do you get pregnant?
There was a little joy, a little wandering, a little more fear, and it was not a good time to be pregnant.
She had a virus in the castle, and she was so indifferent, that she could not take any contraceptives under those conditions, because to escape, they had not thought so much at once, and there was an outcry.
It's awful.
How could her life expectancy be so high?
Twice. often?
Wouldn't it be a Guinness Book of Records if we had one in the future?
It wasted by the wind.
Her mind was so dispersed, that she was walking like a horse, and she was so strong, that she imagined a situation in which ten children were around her crying for Mommy.
Cheng Ya finally understood what is called a tiger body, a moment wake up.
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
Eva, 11 and White Night were already shocked by the splendid expression on her face, slowly enjoyed a silent play, the more wonderful the more wonderful, little milk asked weakly, "Mommy, what are you thinking?
Joan shakes her head and quickly returns to her usual smile, not even to the blink of her eyes, "I don't mean anything.
They didn't know what she was thinking, and she herself wasted by Redne, and if she told anyone, she would have laughed for three days and three nights, and I'm afraid there's only such a good woman in the world who thinks all this shit when she knows she's pregnant, but again, they're not a hundred percent of the mortals,
Ye three little but struggled one day and one night, both of them did not know how many times...
Cheng Anya is psychological balance.
"Goodnight," said the child.
She's worried about her child's health. She's pregnant with an unhealthy child, and she's got a lot of herbicides in her body, and she's probably going to hurt the child. If she's got a little kid with no arms and no legs, or a little kid with intellectual disabilities, she's better off not having him at the beginning.
How can a child be born when he is not healthy?
"Yes, will the child be infected with the virus?"
"It's not clear yet, after all, it's too small, and it's going to have to wait a little longer before it can be checked out," he said.
It's more or less a matter of course. She's pregnant, and it seems that the process of detoxification is going to get more complicated.
He's gonna have to find out about suman.
Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang
Levy, seeing her mind, said softly, Sister-don't worry too much, the virus will be cleared tomorrow, the child is still young, I'm not sure your virus will be cleared, the child's virus will be cleared too.
You and your brother are young and have a chance to have children.
"I think Mum gave birth to a little brother.
"We also think," said Y, "that's too healthy to live," said Y Y, "and my heart is too heavy," said Y Y, "and it doesn't seem like I'm really saying that," she said.
By convention, in fact without checking and knowing, this child can't keep.
Joan thought about it too, her face lost its colour, her eyes were dark, and she had no light, and she had gone through a pain.
Really?
She didn't want to be too pessimistic. She wanted to stay.
The crystal of love, she will not beat.
"Anya, don't bother until the virus is cleared of your body," said he, "and the child, and the engine." His smile was always distant, but it was warm and comfortable, especially a white coat and a doctor, which made him feel more comfortable.
Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang
Levy turned to think about it and asked: "Where are the three sisters, who have been in good condition and have not shown any other symptoms?
Joan is also thinking about this, her body has been healthy, is it really possible to transfer to the child?
If it were, the child would surely be in trouble.
There is a possibility.
With a twisted eye, there was indeed a virus in Cochrane's blood analysis, and it was not possible to say that it had all been transferred to the child, and that if it had been transferred to the child, the child would certainly not have needed it.
"I'll go and talk to Suman.
said he, out of the hall, to Suman's room.
In between the eyelids.
There was anxious premonition in Zhang's heart, like this little life with which he had not yet come into contact, perhaps for no reason, but at the beginning of it was just an empty joy, a heart, a needle of pain.
Mummy, don't worry, until you have a deal with Suman at night.
I'll give you a check.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
"Yes, sister, don't worry too much, perhaps we can't say too well," said Eve with a smile.
Joan laughed, You're all right, I'm just thinking, I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.
"I like my sister. "
My Sister is the most cute. He can be my Sister's flower messenger. He must be a good brother.
Why not the brother?
My brother too, but I still like my sister more. The little milk bag smiled, with a bit of excitement, "If only my sister had been okay,
Soon she will be out.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
I bet on my sister.
"Then you've lost, according to the tradition of the Leaf family," said Leaf, touching her chin, with a verse.
It seems to be.
"I'll have a sister.
CHAPTER 381
Anya returned to the room, sitting, I don't know if the heart act, always feeling the child growing in her belly, there is a feeling of a line of heart, just so many people have nothing very special feeling, just feel shocked.
Now a man stands on a balcony, looking at the moon in the sky, feels a full heart.
She had a very strong mother feeling more moved than when she learned that she was in peace.
Maybe it's the child she had after she fell in love with Yechen, meaning more than that time.
Ning is the pillar of her foreign country, so the child is the crystal of her love with A Chen, and he does not know whether there is a chance to be born, or whether he will be healthy, which A Chen will give any mother more attention and care to the child.
There is no doubt about that.
Unhealth is the biggest problem at present.
Under Heaven all mothers have a mentality, love their children, cherish their children, can hope to live, peacefully grow up, Cheng Anya is no exception.
Tonight at Lyd, the moon is round, the light of the moon is clear and gentle, it shines among the people, the whole city is lit as if it were covered in the mother's gentle arms, she can't help praying, God can give the child a chance to survive.
Joan was not a believer, but she couldn't help thinking that if prayer was really useful, she wouldn't mind burning to the Buddha every day, and praying sincerely.
Mommy.
Rin quietly appeared on the balcony, a soft smile, his face thin a lot, did not have the feeling of such a flesh call, a little grown-up appearance, but as a mother, but feels outwardly lonely, I hated he was always a childlike cute look.
Why haven't you slept so late?
Jian Ya, fearing that she might actually push him into the chest, moved a distance, rather than complaining,
"No," she said.
Mom, don't be so careful.
"My mom," "I'm a natural bug," "You'll let me go."
Miss Chang replied, What?
Can't sleep?
Have I got a sister,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
At a time when she did not know how to answer, to tell the truth, to be afraid of disappointment, to be false and not what she wished, she hesitated for three seconds, choosing to tell the truth.
Don't hope too much. There's a dad and a mom. Don't say a sister.
"Mom, don't you talk so funny? "I don't want a brother, I want a sister.
He had to think of one thing: love, bread.
O O O O.
"Well, then, sister."
She looked forward to the child's safety, and when the three leaves were awakened, she was sure to be surprised. She wondered whether he would be able to say a word or two about the pain I had endured overnight.
It's awful.
"Mom," I said, "I find you are a bit of a man and a woman."
"No," he said.
She likes her daughter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well, you always say brother."
Little Cougar looked down on Anna, pointing out the most direct evidence that he had not heard from the beginning that she was a sister, and that he liked her.
Liar Drop.
Didn't your aunt say? The tradition of the leaves is the rise and fall.
Jiang-Anyary blamed herself, and it was absolutely wrong for her to take a heavy man and light woman.
Who makes a son more beautiful than a girl, more than a daughter, more than a daughter.
"You're going to live," she said. "You're going to go live," she said.
Cheng's face was black, and he wasted his time, and he thought his idea was very good.
When I'm a pig, I don't want to live.

There's no problem with the white night and the suman.
"I'm sure they'll turn her into a snow-white princess even if she's got an Otterman sister. "
Cheng,
A Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good
Son, it is blind trust, Miss Cheung asked in the sky.
"I'm still hoping you'll be all right and then I'll have a good deal with Louis," said the little bottle.

"Oh, Louis..."
He looked up at the moon. Isn't he gone?
"I'm trying to find out," he said, "as long as my ability goes to the next level, I won't have to hesitate.
"The way Louis is hiding now," said the little bottle, "the way the Blacks are hiding is because they are perfectly hiding, because they are better than him in the field of technology, and for the past few days they have been trying to break their limits.
There's nothing good about it.
"Well, you'll do it yourself," said Cheng, softly, knowing that there had to be a price to pay for the death of the promise, that he would not have stopped if he had counted all the bills on Louis' head, and had not taken Louis to the funeral of the promise.
You can leave now.
"It's all right here," said Joan. "It's not too much for the Black Eagles to come."
What's going to happen, you're safe, I can rest assured.The little milk bag smiled.In my mind, or Mommy's first, how can I take no notice of Mommy's for revenge
That's not possible.
"Well, don't make Mom happy," she said, "I'm going to train your little sister after my wife forgets her little daughter."
Who would have believed that little milk had no denied, but said, "Women also have husbands who forget their daughters, Mommy, you are all like this, and you educate your sisters,
The upper and lower beams are twisted.
Joan was so stuck in her milk bag that she couldn't say a word, and half a while she held it out, "So say, this is the best cup in the world.
Little Milk Pack
A.
It's a little serious.
"Mom, I love you the most in the world," said the little milk.
At her heart hurt, yes, she knew that the son loved her most, because the one he loved most was gone.
Joan did not feel like her son was taken away, but rather very painful.
"I know."
Joan smiled,,My baby,you have a sweet mouth tonight.
"Mom is pregnant, I am glad. "The little milk bag laughed, and Cheng Anja shook her head.
Hope your dad wakes up tomorrow. I'm a little expecting his reaction.
Daddy will say,Yeah,you two old boys haven't had enough of the world,and there'll be another light bulb.The little milk bag imitated the shape of the leaf three little explosives, but it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good.
Baby, you've learned too much.
The estate is a bit like ancient aristocratic houses, with modern designs, and also with ancient garden designs, The Suman private garden is a bit like a small garden garden.
The appearance of the house is also antique design, like a flat, but to the person feel very expensive, still is a white玉 for the wall, Ryuchi for the tiles, under the roof there are a lot of white玉 lanterns, to the person feel a very elegant.
There were all kinds of strange plants in the garden, strange varieties, and at night, when you look at them, you don't look at them, and when you look at them, you don't look at them, and when you look at them, you don't look at them, and when you look at them.
It's just a smell in the yard, it's refreshing.
"What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?"
He reached out curiously, trying to touch, and heard a soothing sound pass through the night, "If you don't want to die, you'd better not touch.
His voice was as cold as the ice in winter. If a man were to be drowned by the cold in the hot summer, he shrugged at night.
It's dead. It's a poison?
Has anyone planted poisoned flowers in their own house?
Kind of weird.
"What are you looking for me?" asked Suman coldly. He stood in the moon, and his face grew and strengthened.
The Beautiful.
Thinking at night, is his cold temper against him?
He's very self-aware, so many days together, obviously the relationship is warmer, didn't think to give up again, really...
It's too unexpected.
"I'm here to study with you," she smiled softly, "I'm here to study with you.
CHAPTER 382
Suman, as if he hadn't imagined that she would be pregnant, his eyes froze, and Suman's eyes gleamed at the night,
"You're not calling yourself a genius?
Didn't find out the last few days?
It's a name.
The gentle smile of a spring, the gentle eyebrows of a warm wind, of no concern to Suman's irony, What do you say of me?
You didn't see.
The last time I checked her was eight days ago, when she was pregnant for two days, and the reaction was not at all obvious, and all their attention was on the virus, who would have noticed she was pregnant?
Even if more serious examinations are limited, Suman's laboratory is studying viruses, and there are no more detailed reactions in blood analysis.
It's not a gynecology. It's odd who can find out.
This has nothing to do with his medicine.
Soman hum,I'm not a doctor.
Susan puts all her responsibilities into one single word. She is not a traditional doctor, so she does not have a diagnosis.
And if you're a genius and you don't get a diagnosis, then you're definitely not going to get a home.
Silence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Susan obviously didn't know how to write these two words, her lips softened, "Pregnancy has nothing to do with viruses, and how to get rid of the poison is how to get rid of the poison.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

His eyes were squinted, and he thought about the problem, that, unlike other viruses, he could change the gene cells of the human body, and he was a little worried that the child might actually be a human, or a heterogene.
That's definitely a cup.
But now everyone expects a child, and suddenly tells that to beat is too cruel.
What if the child is not infected with the virus
asked.
Suman laughed,You need to ask this stupid question?
What kind of genius are you? What kind of genius are you?
This kid grew up in a group of viruses, and you're lucky to say he didn't get infected?
"So beautiful, medical judgments are not necessarily 100 percent accurate," he said.
White Night was not afraid of Suman's ridicule, and made his own judgments lightly.
Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She

It's beautiful.
Moreover,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you
Why doesn't he call himself a beauty?
What's the difference?
It was as if you could see what was going on in the night, and it was cooler in the spirit of the Suman, and it was a very frightening spirit.
He knew the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm here to find out about Anna and her child. I'd rather have this child, wouldn't you?
White Night brings out the killer, they are all lovers.
He did eat candy when he was very young, but the key was that the child was very affectionate, otherwise he wouldn't have been so hard trying to protect the three and a half.
"It's going to have to wait for the baby to get checked, and if it's infected, it's mostly not, and it's extremely unstable, and it's possible that it's going to change throughout the pregnancy, and it's going to have other effects," Suman said.
The odds are that virus will combine with the cells to give rise to a superhuman child, perhaps more terrifying than Nine, but the odds are very small, and even if adults are not able to combine the cells with the virus, the chances for an unborn baby are very small.
Silence, said Suman, he understood.
"If you're infected with a virus, can you dissolve the tube?"
asked.
"Eighty percent may not be enough. It's not the first, it's not the second, it's the natural virus.
said Suman softly, like a man who drinks poison from a young age, she will become a poison.
It doesn't work at all.
I wasted at night.
"You can't make it," he asked in the dark. He touched his chin and laughed a little crazy. "Who's telling me I'm a fake, and that's what you are, too
I have a specialty, which is not my strength.
Sue's eyes flickered, not positive answer,
"I know," he said. "I'll tell you tomorrow."
He stood straight in the moon, and the whole man seemed to be in the ice of the moon, as if he were in the ice of the moon.
The night stood still, and looked at Suman with a smile, and his face was as calm as the face of the lake in March, as if he had not heard his words.
Suman laughed, his eyes like snow, What else?
"What are you still angry about?
"I didn't mean," said lightly at night. "You've got it too, and it's time to go."
His tone, but with a touch of deterrence, that is not less than Suman.
He knows why Sue is so uncomfortable.
The White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White
Naturally, he was extremely heated and arrogant, only to be integrated into his vacuity, to give a man a kind of royal misconception.
Suman was lazy, he was noble, and he was a convergent man, but not a convergent one that almost blended into a smile at night.
His inner convergence was covered with frost.
It's cold.
"Don't say anything," he said.
Suman said coldly, very unkind.
He smiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Suman's cold eyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They remembered the accident in the laboratory today.
Almost eight days were spent alone, working together to find a cure for the virus, with the help of the white night, Suman spent a lot of time, and his ability to solve the poison was indeed good, but there were places where it was not as good as the white night.
After all, there is a speciality in the arts, and they both study different directions, so each has a long, mutual compensation.
Superman was very unwilling to see the White Night, because he felt that the White Night had a heart for him, and he felt that he was unwilling to see the White Night, because he had that crazy capital, and he was very unwilling was very unwilling was very unwilling to see the night, because he was very unwilling was unwilling very unwilling very unwilling very unwilling to see at night, because he was unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling
But gradually, a few days of struggle, he also knew that the white night was not a name, the people were also a real material, in the field of medicine really talented, the two co-operated very quietly, and gradually had a topic, the relationship warm and much.
Heroes are always humble, and more than that they are always a genius in their own fields.
Once you're familiar with speaking, there's no taboo. This day, when two big men, one of them being gay, suddenly raise this topic, it's very embarrassing.
Suman obviously didn't want to say too much, and at night he was curious, and he didn't ask.
Who knows? Suman lost his hand when he broke a bottle of test.
There's a bridge in every TV series, where a man falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls
It's a television,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a very classic jq lens. can not be used on suman and white night, why?
He could walk as though he had fallen, and even though he had fallen, he could still stand up. However, at the moment when he realized he had fallen over Suman,
It's awful if it's like this. Suman can't get his hands off.
Well, there's nothing to do with falling over. Surman's not too angry.
Most importantly, this is a classic shot, which is a kiss, without a kiss it is not a classic shot, it is not at all a surprise,
She's just coming up to kiss.
And there was no stop from falling to touching, and to be honest, people thought that she was an accident, but Suman was a man, and at night, he was more than anybody.
He paused for four seconds and raised his hand to give the White Night a kiss.
At that moment, Suman cried aloud, he felt clearly the light of the middle of the night had changed, he did not know well, and tried to push him, but could not come.
It's the first time you've been treated like this.
It's nothing but a trick, a temptation, and a deceit, and at least Vivi never touched his lips.
A kiss for a kiss of a beauty, this business is actually not a loss.
Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan
Who knew that beauty turned her face and isolated her.
Is it you are looking for death? Suman squinted dangerously, and coldly pressed, to mention the matter, and to think of the amazement of the white eyes, he felt severely insulted.
If he's looking for death, he doesn't care for all of him.
They've just raised the subject of homosexuality, and at night they joke that homosexual lovers have hardly been for a long time, and that they're all just looking for something new, which has made Suman very uncomfortable.
But there's no denying that's true.
He also knew that night was different from him, he liked women, he was a straight man.
What does he mean to him? To look fresh, to look beautiful?
He was a man who was not ashamed of being gay, but was a woman by another man.
For the first time in his life he was so uncertain.
"No," he smiled, "I want to live a hundred years."
Susan hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum
Come on, said he, and let go of his sleeves, and leave a cold shadow on the night.
Standing in the evening,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
White Night is very doubtful.
Today, why to kiss him at night is not clear, as if it were an involuntary move, falling that moment, between the noses, are the cold smells he has been very familiar these days.
It was a shame to have a fragrance in a great man, but Suman wasted all the time on the grass, and in the yard there was this cold fragrance.
So close,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was not until the night came to realize what I was doing, had felt the warm touch on the lips, and so kissed.
If it's an accident, then it's not. He's deliberate.
When he looked at the beautiful garden at night, he was a little confused, and he had no idea why he had gone out of the garden of Suman, but he had not noticed that Suman's cold eyes were always looking at his distant back.
Hey!
Soman, hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum
There was a smile across the corner of the man's lips.
It seemed to have seen a hunter throw himself into a net.
Chapter 383
The next day, the lab.
She looked closely at night into the body of three leaves, the translucent liquid flowing like an ice fountain, her heart a bit cool, even her limbs a bit cold, her hands a lot of cold sweat, and looked very tightly at the reaction of the three leaves on the table.
It's not the first time Suman and White Night have tried three drugs in the last few days, but they've been the first to try them on mice. The first two mice died and the second one didn't react.
This time there was a reaction in the mouse, and after Susan's analysis, the toxins in the blood disappeared completely within an hour.
In other words, this is a cure, at least in mice.
Because he had a child, they could not guess what the solution would do to the human body, only to test it on the leaves, and his life had been very limited.
You've got to inject drugs.
Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With less than three leaves, it's not going to last that long.
Little Cheese and Cheng Anya know this is their last chance, and if they don't, let's see today.
After the solution was injected into the leaf, all looked quietly at the graph on the screen, the supply of the tranquilizer has stopped temporarily, the leaf is now only carrying oxygen mask, the rest of the tests have been withdrawn,
But look at the reaction this time.
White Night to the leaves, ther, from the pulse judge, extremely peace, because the tranquilizer has just withdrawn, he has not yet the first sign of awakening, so the pulse presents a state of peace.
But half an hour later, he didn't have a very clear response.
The Virus Virus Virus Virus Virus Virus Virus Virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus
White Night explained to them that black indicated the area where the virus entered, and that from the graphics, the liver, the stomach, the spleen were all infected with the virus, and very severely, and that the body was almost filled with the terror of the virus, and that they were in a state of alienation and mutation.
After injection, a small red bubble appears on the screen, continuously crashing into the black areas, Cheng Yan and others have just seen the demonstration of the mouse, after about ten minutes, the black areas will gradually fade and gradually disappear.
represents the virus is being destroyed.
For half an hour, there was no change in the body, only the red bubbles constantly hit the black area, like the game of justice and evil, Justice is very willing to kill evil, but unable to do it, unable to do it.
His chest looked at the screen, almost holding breath, for the first time felt so nervous, wasn't it the cure?He took a breath of coolness in his heart, and in his precise calculations, there would be a reaction after fifteen minutes, why no reaction at all?
Even the little rats begin to fuse with the virus in only ten minutes.
It's not working.
There was a thin sweat between the dark eyes of the night.
Suman sat quietly in front of the computer, looking coldly at the screen, he looked very calm, could not see a bit of panic, like half an hour without a reaction is normal, not to panic.
Comman's heart washed with cold sweat, and he knew that if the cure did not work this time, there would be no doubt that the three leaves would die, and that if he and the white night were to work on the cure for a second, there would be no result in three or five days.
Jay can wait he can't wait.
The five of the noble man wasted, he didn't look back and know what the person behind looked like.
Cheng Yan and others dare to disturb Suman and White Night, deeply afraid to interrupt their thoughts, Ye and 11 squeezed the lips, and also waited tightly, the small milk bag accompanied Che Cheng Yan Yan, afraid that his mother at some point will not endure such torture.
Waiting between life and death is the most painful, in such a case, is thinking of no hope.
The little bottle looked at Daddy not far from the operating room, eyes showed pain, he had just recognized Daddy less than six months,
He didn't want to lose him, the fools look at the hands of others always say, you must have died in ten years of love.
A later survey revealed that most people died within the age of 10
It's grandpa, it's mom, it's grandma, etc. He's lost Nono.
So he's lost a loved one, So Daddy, must live.
If he died, his mom would probably die and die, and he wouldn't be happy for life.
Dad,you gotta stay.
He was always very confident about Suman and White Night, but he didn't know how nervous he was until this crucial moment.
Anya, standing alone, with her hands at the edge of the table, her eyes staring at the screen like a torch, deeply afraid of a leak, she prayed so hard that the cure could work quickly.
"White Night," said Suman.
White's eye froze, and he didn't ask again, and injected him to know the medicine.
In fact, this solvent is also a poison, if not the leaf three small body virus, a single injection solvent is sufficient to poison a person within a minute, so the weighting is also a certain risk, a little calculation error rather than the solvent death.
"White Night, what's going on, and why is there no reaction?"
YV asked nervously, Isn't it heartbreaking?
Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait
He told you would wake up in an hour, and if he didn't wake up, he would die.
But you've been waiting for an hour, and he's not awake yet.
It's like hoping tos a drop through your fingernails.
Suddenly, there was a ringing on the operating room, and the hands of the three were moving, and he seemed to want to get rid of his chains, but he was caught, and he was hurrying, pulling hard, pulling hard, and moving very hard.
Everyone was astonished, and Sudman quickly analyzed the mechanics of his body on the computer, and Leth was at first humming, like receiving something painful, and his head was shaking, and his body was trying desperately to get rid of the clamp, and Cheng Anya and Leth Wei were trying to get past but were stopped at night.
Suddenly, there was a roar, "Oh..."
Closed eyes for ten days, opened, dark eyes full of blood, scared, hands and feet began to struggle fiercely, constantly mad, screaming, as if mad.
Their eyes were filled with bitterness.
With her mouth tight, her heart was like a knife, she could not see, she looked at the table with her eyes closed.
His crazy voice still passed through his ears.
Achen
"Dad..."
My brother...what's wrong?
Eva was astonished, "Soman, what's wrong with me?
"The cure begins to respond. "
"If he had withdrawn his sedative, he would have been in pain," said Suman, softly
It's a normal reaction.
Besides, we have added weight, he will be more painful.
said the White Night.
Isn't Dad going to be okay?
"You can't die with a reaction," said Suman, who had his hands busy testing all the indicators in the leaf, while ordering him to inject several tests at night.
It's cool. It's strong.
Their hearts were much more relaxed when they heard that they could not die.
They were outside, they could not understand, but they knew that the pain of the three leaves seemed to have been reduced, and that cry that seemed to have been taken out of all the bowels was a little terrifying.
It was a little scary, it sounded dull, and his hands and feet were tied together with a cord, and blood was flowing, and bones were visible, as if they were embedded in his bones.
De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De
"It'll be all right, Dad," you hold on. "The little milk bag shakes," he said.
"He can't hear," said the White, smiling, "I can't feel anything at the moment, except pain and dying dizziness, which lasted for almost ten minutes.
Only then did therapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprap
At the same time, the leaf three little body slowly out a layer of sweat.
His roar wasted away, and turned into a painful hum.
At last, White gave him a serum, completed the last step of understanding the poison, the leaves were less tired, and fell asleep.
It was a hurry to get past and to stop at night.
Don't get hooked again.The next one is for you.
Cheng Anja's foot wasted,
Really?
Is He OK?
"Yes," he said.
"Great," Yves applauded, and the room was filled with cheers, and even the corner of Suman's lips was filled with laughter.
After such a horrible detoxification process, the little milk packed with anxious, "Will my mother be as painful as my father?
"No," he smiled at night.
CHAPTER 384 Children under the Virus
The treatment was not painful, like the usual injection. After the injection, the whole person fell asleep, and then lay on another operating table.
From an inside view, almost all of the viruses in the body are concentrated in the direction of the uterus.
As was expected by the night, Ye had said, the condition of Anya was very strange, not at all like that of the virus, and he asked her, when she was first on the island of Louis, that it was not at all, that she would also be sick, with no strength, and with pain in her intestines.
This happened when they were at Prince William's Castle, which means that the child was slowly absorbing the virus, and that the child was growing up in the same way.
Suman said yes, he didn't look at the inside, but he knew that the child must have been infected.
"Do you dare this child to take the virus as a nourishment?" Levy looked at the inside view, very shocked, eyes wide open, a bit unbelievable, and a little worried.
This picture is a little scary.
It should be.
said White Night, feeling a bit shaken, the child was in the womb during the course of the virus, and the child was born to carry the virus,
Don't tell me what the virus will do to him. If it comes out, isn't everyone going to get it?
Suman's eyebrows twisted, and he saw little of the beauty's eyebrows; Ye, the eleven, and the little milk; and the three sleep together quietly, without any sense; and the four sleep without any sense;
They were very nervous.
"Soman," asked the little milk.
"I don't know for a while," said Suman, clapping his hands, "I don't know for a while," he said, "I'm sure it's infected," and "I don't know if it's going to be any problem," he said, "I don't know if it's going to be any problem."
Therapeutic treatment was taking place, slowly eliminating the virus in her body, she did not have the severe pain of the leaves, but lay quietly, as if asleep, with a little calmness.
"White Night," I heard the old witch say, "isn't there a reason for the wolf to test the poison?"
Eve suddenly asked, remembering the things many years ago, the eyes twisted more tightly.
"A poison," said Suman.
There is one thing, said the wolf, who once bred the babies as poisons, and from what they ate at birth they had a great deal of poison, a dozen children, a dozen who died, and three who lived
Later, all of their foods were poisoned, and two people died during their growth, and only one survived.This child, very different from the ordinary child, was a poisoned carrier, and anyone who touched him would be poisoned and died.
It takes a few months to get the serum, and the gas he breathes is poison.
"It's cruel."
Little Cheese, how can have such a cruel man?
His No was in the hands of the wolf, which had not cultivated her as a poison, such a pain is absolutely not to be endured by the common man.
"It's really cruel," she said, "and then the old witch imprisoned her child, so that she and the wolf could have a quarrel.
Their success is so low that many people who die are able to grow one, and the food of the poison is very poisonous, and the normal diet, if it lasts long enough, will be fatal because of the lack of toxins, he said quietly at night, and this is what they have just heard, and whatever they have heard in the camp must be believed, and it is absolutely true.
If so, if the virus disappears, will the child die?
It's too complicated, and she feels too deep, too unintelligible.
"I've heard of it, but it's not like it's with children," Suman said, "If children grow up, it means that the virus has fused with the children's cells.
Look at him, though he's not yet shaped, but he's growing,
It's not like poison, it's possible to control the virus, and if he doesn't have the virus, he's destined for nothing with the world, said Suman.
White Night also injected her serum.
It's a good thing, but it's a good thing, it's a good thing.
Eve,,,,BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
Suman and the little lamb walked to the end, the little lambmb smile said, Suman, this is really hard for you.
"A small thing," said Suman, his hands on his shoulder.
The little bottle smiled, and Sumanla sat down on his chair in the courtyard. It was a dark day today, and the temperature was a little low, and the courtyard was not too hot.
asked Suman, When will you go?
They certainly can't stay long, Long, the first terrorist organization, the Black Party are in the most confused, the most nervous phase, no one knows who will laugh to the end, definitely can't stay too long.
All of them, some of the core of the terrorist organization, some of the core of the Longmen, have to think about how to deal with the blackmail of the Party and of the coalition of governments,
The second half is expected to be very volatile.
"I'm going to ask you this question, my mom will have any problem,
Will the kid with the virus release the mother again poison?
The little bottle thinks carefully about this.
"No, they have antibodies, and the same virus has no effect on them," said Suman.
"I've been thinking about this for a long time," he said, "and if anything happens, it'll happen to the children, and not to the adults.
The worst intention is to take away the child.
Give him a little head, and he'll be safe.
"I'm just worried about Mommymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymy
His face was slightly darkened, and he was about to find Louis' hiding place.
"On the power line, the first terrorist organization is the old, the black party old two, the Longmen old three, the old two want to get rid of the old, no one can, certainly will pull the old three," said Suman, smiling
He is not enough, but sees the situation, these things can not hide from him.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
The Black Party also divided North America, and terrorist organizations will also be thirty, and by the time it really becomes a mountain two tiger situation, it will not be possible to do anything else.
Of course, on the premise that he can swallow North America.
Suman smiled.
When the first milk came, he was busy with the virus, and had no time to talk.
We're about to go. Soman's a little uncomfortable.
But after all he's a scatter, it's just a coincidence. Moreover, in the future, there will surely be a lot of scatter.
"It's really calm," he said. "It's been so many days,
Lewis should have known that my parents were not in Riyadh. It's strange.
He'd like to get you into a cage, get him to throw himself into the net, get all the Longmen and the First Terrorist out of Riyadh, and leave Eve and Eleven, and Louis didn't do anything, so he was surprised.
"Have you taken the world," said Suman softly, "and think of the little milk.
Suddenly asked Suman, Hasn't the last gun been made?
"You say a high-speed magnetic pulse.
"Your design is too hard to make, and many of them are failures, one success.
But it might be easier to build later.
That's good. I thought it would take another month or two.
Their backup force is very strong.
"Of course," said the little dairy, "because it was the first person to test a gun at night.
It's awful how powerful it is to blow it up at the speed of a fighter.
"It's close to light."
Suman laughed, this was his three years of heart, designing his best work.
If it were sold on the road, it would have been cheap, and the result would have been cheated by the small milk bag.
White Night was the first to test a gun.
The little milk, with a smile, the dark eyes, with a little cheat, So beautiful, why do you have such an opinion of the night
Our house is the most subtle terrorist organization, very handsome, the best man of temper, blossoms, you are like a jewel, what a good adjective, what a nice.
Are you selling your stalls?
Suman turned his head, and his cheerful face smiled, for the relationship of the angle was beautiful, and this time there was more of an astonishing beauty,
All the little milks shouted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and he could not help touching Suman's chest with his hands.
Hard.
Poor Poor Poor Poor Poor Poor Poor Poor Poor Poor Poor
Suman smiled as he touched, his face with light tolerance, "You are a man, and your behavior is the same.
Eve did not know how many times she had touched his chest to confirm that he was a man and a woman.
"You're really bad," said the little milk bag, laughing.
"What a sellout, our house is a sellout.
"The quality, appearance, utility, etc. is absolutely not to say, or a multi-functional product.
Suman laughed, too the metaphor.
The little milk was perfect, and for the first time he smiled and showed his teeth.
The scene seen on the far balcony of the villa and in the eyes of the white night, that is a rape four shots.
Soman smiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's too much.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh.
"You're thinking too much, aren't you sure you'd rather be rude to him?"
He laughed, and went downstairs.
Levy took a look at her eyebrows, followed by a quick step, and asked, on the shoulder of White Night, do you have any interest in the beauty of Sue?
I like beautiful.
Ye, what do I want to suggest to Su?
"A" is not a beautiful.
Beautiful, that's different than beautiful.
Come on, don't hit your mouth.
"You don't want a beauty," he said with a smile, "let her circle his neck," he didn't realize he was too close.
Rather,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Otherwise, Levy and 11 have been together for more than a dozen years, how can it be that Jason has loved 11 when he was younger, but he can't do it later, when his family is better than his lover.
Because it's too early.
"No," he said.
"I still like Sue a little more," said Eve with a grin.
She kept her mouth shut.
White Night was a reminder to her that, as long as I and Anya were awake, we were almost to leave Lyia, and that there must be a hard battle, and that you should be well prepared, for I know that you are not going to be emotionally useful, but there are many things that are better for you to wake up, lest you be ruined.
White was worried about her, too.
M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M
You don't believe in slaves?
Eve twisted his arm,I'm like selling to you?
Don't mess with me. I'm worried about you.
"It's dangerous," he smiled softly. "It feels like you're not an opponent.
"Yes, but the slave is not his opponent?"
As for mind, men are stronger than women.
"You see Anya is so smart," he said with a smile. "I think it's easy to get along," he said.
"You're a gender discriminator.
"I'm just disrespecting you, in all, be careful."
"You know the slaves are not going to let you down.
She smiled, and the two happened to be in the court, and she came together, and kissed her white cheek in all manner of ways, and said in a low voice, "I appreciate you.
At night I couldn't cry, I looked up and suddenly saw Suman and the little milk.
Suman was still, his eyes were cold, and at a glance there was no soft smile in front of the small milk, just a cold hum.
CHAPTER 385
The night was dark, and the moon jumped from the balcony, and broke the silver; and in the room there was a shining lamp, and the light was soft, and the eyes were not touched, as though a thin veil had passed, and the whole room was warm.
The poison was, she knew, and she thought, when she injected her poison at night, that if she did not wake up, she would fall asleep and die unconsciously, without feeling any pain, as it is often said, a happy death. She laughed at herself, thinking of all these things in her mind at that time, but in that moment, her mind was relaxed.
After all, she knew, that the young man would be safe, even if he died, the only regret was the child.
Dead is not a good thing.
She laughed, and turned, and saw her three little leaves sleeping by her side, warm and melting in her womb, warm to her bones.
Their room was still their room, but they changed a bed, and the silk was warm and cold, and baked the temperature of the body, and felt that the pores of the whole body were stretched out, very comfortable.
Perhaps it was because they were poisoned, she had no need to restrain herself, she had no need to infect innocent people, she had no need to kill her relatives, and for a few days, she seemed to be at ease, as she was always talking to them about the heavens, but her heart was very heavy, and from the death of Zhang Po, the giant stone had been pressed against her head, and she had been driven out of breath at midnight.
It's a heart disease, and she wants to be isolated from the crowd, and she's afraid of innocent death.
Now that big stone has been crushed, her heart is a lot loose, I know, a light feeling, really comfortable, like a resurrection.
There was a slight breath of leaves, and when he was healed, his face was grim, as if the scene of madness had gone away, and she only knew that he was now resting and at rest.
All things are worthy of thee; and thou shalt hear the words of men, saying, Thou shalt not die, but thou shalt be blessed.
How many times have they suffered, how many times have they jumped in the desert, how many times have they been trapped in the desert, how many times have they been killed in the castle, how many times have they been blown to pieces in the sea, how many times have they been wandering by death, and how many times have they been wandering by viruses, and how many times have they been safe, and how many times have they been safe?
I hope so.
Dean knew that Louis had not died, that the Black Party had not been traced, that Longmen had been changed a great deal in the previous days, and that all had been manipulated by men behind the scenes, in an attempt to stir up a bloody storm again, and that all had not been heard, and that she had been well acquainted with the analysis and discussions of the Little Cougar and Levy.
There will be a greater wave after this cure, she only hoped, having tasted so many pains among men, had tasted all the pains of his life.
I'll be there later.
With a sigh she touched his brows.
Her eyebrows were thick, her shape was beautiful, her eyes were closed, her eyelashes were lengthened, from the side of her face, and her eyes were slightly curved, and her eyelids were covered with a thin shade. Her nose was high, her lips were beautiful, her five senses were exquisite, like God's exquisite.
The Master's fingers crossed his lips, a little dry, reminding him of the burning of the lips, and with a moment of astonishment, he turned his fingers, and knew not what he would have done if he had known that she had touched him in the dark.
Little did she look at his five organs so attentively, and in her mind she thought of him as he was, as he was angry, as he was black, as he was beset, and so on, and so on, and so on.
The laughter washed over the lips.
"Do I have such a good laugh?" "I have such a good laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh
When did he wake up? When did he wake up? When he thought of his long fingers brushing over his five senses, his fingers heated and his face burned.
"Are you awake?"

"It's just a skin injury," he said, looking at his wrists and at his wrists.
He remembered in his hallucinations of his madness, with the sound of metal banging on his ears, but at the time the pain seemed insignificant, and he had no impression.
"The skin wound must be treated, and you mustn't be disturbed," said Cheng. He took the medicine aside, and took the cloth and gave it to him again.
With astonishment, he looked hastily at Anya's hands, and she was safe.
Cheng Anja nodded, and told the matter again, and spared the child only one thing, and she did not know how to tell him the thing, and she took the medicine, and she rebounded him.
"You haven't answered my question. "Lee tries tos his head into the near-head.
If you dare to watch him laugh, you should.
"Can't I be happy? " "It's too happy to be laughing," he said.
Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li
"It's been nine days," said Cheng.
She's been worried for nine days.
Especially at the time of the cure today, especially the feeling of wandering on the edge of despair, even more in the bone of memory, she will never forget the waiting torment, more difficult than any time.
Li looked at her eyes, and said, For so long, you should kiss me, learn to kiss the prince.
He leaned over his mouth and kissed.
With his palm he pulled to the other side, laughing and cursing, "Where are you like the princess?"
You're crazy.
Li also laughed, had a little heavy atmosphere suddenly spread, a joy.
Shearararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararar
Suddenly, with his arms pressed into his arms, Leth had become the chief objector, drilled into her lips, kissed her deeply, swept through her lips every inch of softness, rolled the tip of her tongue, sucked a little bite, enjoyed the joy of resurrection after death, lost and recovered excitement.
Everyone is well when they fall asleep, maybe more than wake up prepared, with the other complex emotions, can now live, whose heart is not moved, happy.
It's a precious thing.
Joan closed her eyes to enjoy his kiss, her familiar smell in her nose, her eyebrows passing, the wind blowing, the room filled with tenderness all over the sea.
As if the kiss were not enough, the leaves were not enough, and as soon as they had let her breathe, they had covered her lips, and hesitated to kiss, and his lips were as hesitated and as mighty as those of his people.

He kissed her,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This feeling, a little strange, and a little familiar, that day and night in the desert castle, I have had so many times, that even the tips of my fingers seem to be powerless, and in his arms become a pool of spring water.
You're Going.
"Anya..." The low, dull voice rose slowly, the burning breath was poured on the delicate skin between Anya's necks, the snow was dyed with pink, the wet kiss went down, took her clothes, the touch of the wound, the three leaves briefly hummed.
Anya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
"It's all right.""""It's all right.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
"Yes, I am, I am not dead, I am not in need of these two days."
But it's also a matter of color.
"No, you come?" said the younger of the leaves, blinking his eyes in confusion, with a little darkness, and with a little green gleam of tears, as if he were expecting Miss to lead.
Jiang's face was red, pushing his shoulder, indicating him down,"I won't."
"I'll teach you."
"..."
Miss Cheung's face was more red, and Le leaned down, and said to her ears, Cheng An-ya almost kicked him down, with a thin, embarrassed face, "You little girl, shut up."
Le trembled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Levy and the little milk wrapped slowly, Levy saw her sister-in-law's cheeks red, a face of spring, a face of silk, her brother-in-law's face of dissatisfaction, a face of desolation, she... for the first time felt that the feeling of destroying someone's good is so...
It's cool.
The little milk bag waved goodbye, said Yves, "My brother and sister, you are very good, very good... continue, continue, we will come again in a short time..."
"Well, go on, go on..."
Two large and one small stand without moving means, with a tray in hand, very purely to watch.
Hadn't Jae had a wound to his left foot and kicked him down to the bed, lam, it's a shame...
Ray Ray Ray Ray Ray Ray Ray Ray
It's the feeling being raped in the bed.
"You two are too blind. "It was a little cold," he hummed, "and it came from her, and fortunately there was no monkey who hurried to tear off her clothes, or else it would have been better.
Hey, hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
She and Nine had a good time, and they hadn't eaten a day, and Ye had brought some easy to digest food, and she had been thinking about her family's sisters and sisters' bodies, so that they wouldn't have to ring the bell again.
Who knew this would happen?
The little package was very unexpected, although deeply understood that his father had been hungry for a long time, yet did not think so brave.
Thinking he himself was uncomfortable to let Mommy come, it is really... pollute the pure mind of the underage, the little milk bag is also a bit of a correction.
"Brother, come, drink ice cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's awful to a man who wants to be unhappy.
After being embarrassed, she felt nothing, and with her family, the heart is not strong enough, this thing is not enough to make her panic, and the clothes are not overwhelmed, otherwise she will lose face.
"Mommymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymy

"It's really violent."The little milkbag laughed, dragging Anya to the table, "Mommy, I haven't tasted my baby's handicrafts for a long time, and I'm ready."
The leaves were clouded early.
He's hungry. It's double hunger.
Chapter 386
Once the virus is gone, it is time to talk about leaving Riyadh, and Yves 11 and White Night have negotiated, that they should return to Rome, for a time, to intensify their efforts, and as soon as possible to deal with the resentment between Prince William and Chu.
Today's main task is to deal with the Black Party, most of whom have been distracted by Louis's use of the power of the First Terrorist Organization, they cannot and will not spend too much time with Prince William.
White had contacts with Chu, and when he returned to Rome to explain the matter, he began to mobilize the international forces of the First Terrorist Organization, using the international situation to force Prince William to lower his head, and he did not believe that William would burn the stone for the sake of his face and Chu.
This is the quickest way to solve the problem.
Eleven and Eve of course have something to do, they have to find the brothers and Louis down.
"Daddy, Mom," said the little milk, "will you go with me at night, please?"
That's the main reason why he and Yves are upstairs looking for their parents. If it wasn't for this change, the little milk bag would have been looking for the first terrorist organization, and this was just an opportunity to exercise, he didn't want to miss.
To learn more from their side, this is the way he intends to go to the dark, must learn a whole thing, not always to stay with his parents, and most importantly, he wants to revenge for Nono.
Lewis and the wolf, he didn't want to leave either.
There's nothing wrong with Ying's head, indicating that the object of his son's persuasion is his mother.
Mommymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymy
Jia leaned back, looked deeply at the little milk, for a moment, the little milk also looked quietly at her, very persistent.
What's she's trying to stop now? She decided to let her son fly as soon as she had escaped.
She really couldn't give him the skills he needed to grow up.
"I don't mind if you decide.
Jiang Ya finally accepted.
Levy wasted her mind, and before that, it was a little difficult to convince her, and after this, she herself knew that it was easy to hold back, and she did not know how to thank Louis for giving her such a shocking lesson.
Mommy, you're the best.
The little bottle came and wrapped it around her neck.
"Do what you want to do. You're grown. Mom believes your judgment.
After this, she grew up.
Her son has grown up.
She's got to let go.
His son is a kite in the sky, his mother is this line, always bound him, he will never fly this part of the world, only with the line, he will be able to fly higher, fly farther.
It didn't matter how loose the lines were, as long as the son didn't fall, she would shrink, and eventually come back.
Li looked at the mother, and smiled.
The blessings of his life, were to meet him, to know him, to love him, and to have such an excellent son, which was the blessing of his life, and which he should cherish.
"Dad, Mum, what about you?" asked the little one. "Are you going back to town?"
"I'm going back, I've been away for a month, and Lin and Tang are all worried, that the three of us are going to get together to fight against the Negro Party, that Louis's next game is going to take over North America, and that the Lord of the Rings is going to take over."
No No No No No No No No No No No
Mummy, don't, stay in Riyadh, this is Suman's house, it's forbidden, there's Suman, no one can help you, wait for the situation to settle down, will you go back to a city, please?
Joan shook her head.I don't.I'm going back with you.it's not a deal.
Little Milk knew his mother's personality, and since she had said so, there must be no room for business. He must not look at the leaves.
Shen smiled,This time I will take her for twenty-four hours, never will the same thing be repeated.
In addition, the Longmen's killers will protect them for twenty-four hours, will not go up again so negligent, passive, this time Louis is hard to get near city a.
This, as I see it, is not much better to follow Sango and to stay on the side of the Suman, and now the city is a peaceful belt, and in fact Lydia is a little unsafe, though they are averse to the Suman, but if the three sisters, Louis will burn with a stone.
"We don't have any news about Louis and Major General yet," she said calmly. "I'd rather you'd have a look at their tracks and notified them as soon as they were found by city a."
"It's natural," said the little bottle, holding her hand, "Mommy, baby, you'll never be surprised again."
Before she had a good word, she had a shot of iron, and she had flattened her little chest, and she had covered her pained head, and she had stared at her big eyes, and she had looked at her little chest with regret.
"Dad, are you going to make me a fool?"
"That's what I said. When did you take my speech?"
Xiao, with his eyes n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n
That's what he's always said.

That's not what the little bottle is smart about.
Jiang Ya turned his eyes white, and learned his movement to give him a punch, "You shut me up.
Eva laughed.
Against you.

"You can be sure," he said, "that's how he's dangerous.
Nothing's gonna happen.
The little bottle laughed modestly.
`Now that's decided, I'll send people to prepare for the plane,' said Levy. `My sister-in-law, if there's anything wrong with you, let Suman know in time.
Don't worry, I know.
"Isn't Anya poisoning?"
The three little voices, heart jump, eyes burning, looking toward Anja, passed a little panic.
Hasn't Sister said? She's got her poison, and she hasn't reacted yet to that.
Eva exits, Cheng Ya wants to stop has not come.
It's been petrified.
CHAPTER 387 The Talk
Less than ten minutes before he was able to digest the meaning of Less Less Less Less Less Less Less Less Less Less Less Less.
When he returned, he drank two cups of hot tea.
Is it a happy fool or is it an angry fool? she wondered curiously, the child came really suddenly, not in their plan, but at last came, she was very happy in her heart.
What about him?
Seeing him so lovingly, she thought, he loved the child most, but his reaction was too long, and she waited almost to wake him up to give him the rest of the reaction.
One's expression hanged for too long, he's not tired, she looked into the people.
Are You Pregnant?
"Well, that night in the desert."
She said softly, with her hands tightened, the man had fallen into his warm arms, his chest pressed down with a big hand, his kiss had fallen, and her lips.
He kissed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A kiss like a storm, which she had not resisted, fell back into his arms, and naturally accepted.
Leth retreated her hand, and kissed him very, very, very hard.
Even though it was not the first kiss, the leaves were not always gentle, but it was the first, so rough, that she even tasted a little salty of blood between her lips.
She sighed, the man will never learn anything to be gentle.
You're not excited.
His breath was almost snatched away from him, and he kissed her cheek, and her ears were white, and her neck and neck were filled with hot air, and her belly was filled with heat, and she was troubled.
She wasted and her skin turned pale pink.
In a moment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The moment felt calm and far away.
Forever.
She knew enough, though each expressed joy in different ways, but she did not correctly admit, she also rather liked the action of the Li Li, the action of the school, in the heart, sweet, sweet.
There is no doubt that is what he likes.
How good it would have been if, seven years ago, Leth had known that she was in peace, what would have been his reaction, more or less a cold face, a cruel undertaking, to strike, if he hadn't.
The difference between compassion and compassion is really big.
"I'm so happy," she said, "I'm so happy," and let go for a long time.
Joan laughed. I was too happy.
Nine Nine.
In the last few days, except for the day, and Ye, and others, close attention to the situation, and exchange of information with the other side of Chu, to study the countermeasures, the small milk bag the rest of the time is drilling for computer technology.
He had to admit that he had a little distance.
It is very difficult to rise again when faced with a barrier.
It's like you've got 100 marks, you've got to go up, you've got no room, the only difference is the perfectness of the roll.
Sometimes you have to pay more.
He's a genius, and he's destined to go one step faster than any other, and any difficulty can do half as much, as this time, even though he hasn't reached the level of his own.
But at least he knew that was not true, and in a moment he would be able to defeat the two brothers, and in this field he would be the last king.
When he came, he was still busy.
Father would rather stop his work and look at the clock
It's morning. "Dad, why haven't you slept?"
What about you? Didn't you sleep?
Ying sat down next to Ning, and when he saw the computer, he rubbed his son's head, "Don't play too much.
It doesn't matter. Little Milk smiles.It's an invitation to the brothers, and I'm not tired, but rather very passionate, Daddy, I'll soon be able to overcome them,
It's not difficult to get Louis by the time.
It was difficult for him to sleep at night, and when he slept, he dreamed of a promise, and his red dress was like a fire rose, and he laughed, but he could not touch it.
He woke up in a lonely place. He was afraid of this, and he could hardly sleep at night, except for sleep aids.
Exactly. There's a lot of time with the brothers.
Ye smiled,I believe you.
Why don't you go with Mommy?
"She fell asleep," said Ya, looking at her son with a smile, "Daddy, do you have anything to say to me?"
It's not too late. Dad's gonna come and see him.
"This time leave us, and be careful, you know? For Louis, I know you hate him, but don't try to revenge, or you'll lose your way.
He was always anxious in his heart, and he could feel that his son had changed, and he could not feel that he had changed, even though he had been the first of his kind in the sight of them.
He's always worried, He's got too much hatred in his heart, to hurt himself.
How much he hated Louis at this moment, how much he wanted to kill, how much he wanted to do, how much he was lost.
A man who is too attached to something will always have a negative effect, and once he has done it, he will have to find something else to support him.
Promise will never come back. His heart will never be healed. He is afraid that his son will go further on this path of vengeance.
After all, it is self-destructive.
That's what he talks about.
For so many years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Father, I don't understand what you are saying.
Ning elegantly smiled, still seemed a little tender fingers on the keyboard gently knocked, without purpose, eyes looked out to the window, not to see the three leaves.
You don't understand, but no one can understand.
Never lost, never understood this heartbreaking despair, he thought occasionally, alone on the balcony, of the sky of Lyhad, of the slaughter of the Negroes, that perhaps his heart's hatred might be lessened.
His heart became cruel.
"You don't understand," replied Ying in a low voice. "My son is too smart, too early," he said. "My father's way of being with him has always been like being with friends," he said. "He has never spoken so seriously to Ninening, nor has he ever been angry with him.
This son is perfect.
He won't make you angry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's because it's so smart, it's harder to worry about.
Quiet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Their eyes turned, as if they were caught by a ghost.
The room was very quiet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Be quiet, you've grown up, and you haven't listened to me?"
The silence of his guess.
Father, I know.
He said with a soft voice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Just...
"Well, if you punish yourself, the death of the promise is meaningless at all," said Ye, quietly, "if it were your mother, she would certainly not have liked me to be a cruel man who only knows hatred and does not know love."
Don't you know how to love? Maybe, I hear hate too long, I really don't know how to love, Louis died, I'm afraid doesn't solve his heart's hate, but after, who will he hate?
For the first time, Nine felt that Ychen's image in his heart, became so high.
The hand on his shoulder, too, became so strong.
Father, I know.
Le tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre.
He said, Get up and go.
He stared quietly at the door where the shadow of the leaves had disappeared. He had no idea what it was like to have been talking to him like this for the first time since he had made the promise.
A little angry, but the man is his father, he can not be angry.
It was a little shocking, because Dad hadn't said anything, but at a glance saw his heart.
He felt that child, no matter how big, how smart, in the eyes of the parents, still no cover, anything is exposed.
Previously, he felt that without a father, he could make Cheng Anya's life without trouble.
Knowing Yechen, he liked this father, he took thousands of photos of them, wanting a whole house, actually for him, father, only more one who loves him, and more one who he loves.
He didn't know what the warmth of his heart was at this moment, but after many years he came to realize that the father had played such an important role in his son's life.
Within his subconscious, he listened to his words, and there was nothing to turn against, and went astray.
