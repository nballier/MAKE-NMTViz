Chapter 449 Neighbor's Dog
After carefully looking at the house, determined that there are no big problems, then basically settled, the rest of the thing Nanfeng will find the real estate agent and the owner of the original.
It's a good day. It's good to go out and enjoy.
"Don't worry," said the South Wind, "I'll be able to live in it the next time, and I'll be able to swim in the sea every day, and I'll be able to play with shrimp."
After a round in the sea was called to the shore, and played with the sand for a long time, waiting to leave, the dog's eyes stared out the window of the car, full of.
Curry is happy, lying in the car begin to imagine the future happiness life.
What is the impression on the ocean?
It feels like you don't have to pay for a seafood buffet.
His cheerful mood continued until he returned to the student dormitory.
As soon as the three south winds left, the side called on the door of the dormitory, "wrap the hair.
Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso
Have a nice day?
"Wang!"
Isn't it fun over there?
Their hair jumped up again, and their tails were thrown out with special vigor.
Speak.
"It's fun," he said.
He is now proficient in changing languages, and the pronunciation standard is too low.
"Well," hesitted, then opened the learning machine.
Curl Curl Curl
Their ears trembled, their claws shrinked, and they took a step back, they thought, in hiding.

One Hundred Ocean Knowledge
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
It's all about 20 books.
There are not only electronic books, but also accompanying test questions, twenty sets.
Curl Curl Curl
The vibrating ears fell.
"You know you're looking for books fast, now you should be faster? When you've finished the twenty books in your folder, the corresponding twenty test questions are all scored, you go to the sea and play.
There are not more than fifteen days to go, said the summoner.
It's all hard knowledge, with the hair now memory and learning ability, to get the full score is not difficult.
To go into the sea, the summons are not concerned about its safety, on the contrary, he is concerned about the to eat some of the endangered animals in the sea.
It is not yet clear how large the stomach is.
During the Wharf's recordings, it had stolen food in the desert, and it had stolen food in the sea, but it hadn't really opened its stomach to eat, just because of the warning.
After all, it is not long to stop at the dock, and there is another way to call the pipes, and to take into account the others at the dock, it can not eat too much.
But when I moved to a new home and had the opportunity to go into the sea every day, without any regulation, it would have been an invasion of the species, to break the ecological balance of the area with the power of a dog.
It's not easy to restore marine life to what it is today, but it can't be destroyed.
Do not complete separate to the sea, continue with the learning machine!
On this day, the south wind has come for the new house decoration.
At the entrance, the south wind saw the coat on the wall, hanging on the dog's head, and below the dog's eyes there were tears.
As the foot slowed, the south wind shifted the view, to find the summon, to settle the matter before hand.
As for thermal side, this is the norm, the south wind has been able to look very lightly.
After talking about the decoration, the south wind remembered what was seen today, and said, "Yes boss, do you know what is on the Internet today?
What's going on his paper today? The communications are set up, and nothing important will disturb him.
During this time there is a lot about him on the internet, and there are a lot of people looking for him, and the summons can only set the do not disturb mode.
"Do you know Will's painting?" asked the south wind.
"You know, about Will's career?"
Will's final painting was called "Neighbor's Dog" and received an A+.
It's been two days, plus he's been writing papers in his dorm since this morning, and he really doesn't know what's happened on the internet.
The South Wind will listen to the information.
After Will's final exhibition, the college placed his paintings on the school's website, sparking enthusiasm.
Will successfully completed his retraining plan last year - short-to--to--to--to--to---to---to---to---to---to---to---to---to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to---to---to---to---to---to---to---to---to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to-to--to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to
Will's short-term goal was already achieved, and Will's "My Neighbor" was initially popular on the Internet, as well as online jokes that Will was summoned to paint like an alien.
This time, after "My Neighbor", "Neighbor's Dog" again climbed the day's hot list.
The Neighbor's Dog is the longest, most intensive, and most satisfying work by Will.
This painting is closer to the style of My Neighbour, but it looks more difficult to understand, My Neighbour can also be seen as a person, My Neighbour's Dog can't be seen as a dog, unless you see the name of the painting, nobody will think it's a dog or a little pet dog.
The rich color rendering, Mystery and embodiment of the atmosphere, seems to be too super secular, but also can not say where wrong, the more research, the heart will lift up a sense of tremor.
Isn't that scary?A student of the Royal School of Art, after seeing the picture, recalled the little curly dog he had met on campus, and went on the Internet to search for that dog, and was sure that he hadn't made any mistakes.
On the other hand, the people who listened to the concert also analyzed the Will painting closely, is another impression.
"Well, this painting gives me a feeling similar to the one called 'η'.
It's a little more than people understand.
Even outsiders standing in front of this painting, looking quietly for a few seconds, even if they don't understand, their hearts are hairy, and their bodies can't help feeling cold.
On the Internet, discussion is even more intense.
"I found that Will, after the training, was completely free of thoughts, which I didn't expect to understand. "
What hatred, what hatred! What hatred!
"The friend before must have never seen a picture by Will. "My Neighbour" let's see first how Will paints.
"I don't know if Will was bitten by a dog, or if he had a mental shadow, he wouldn't have been so scary!
It's called art!
"The world of artists isn't what I think it is.
I stared at the painting for five minutes, and I didn't realize what he was saying, but I felt like a good bull, and I had a strange feeling in my heart.
"These paintings belong to a deeper level and need to be studied in detail.
Isn't this painting good for sale?
"You can buy it back."
Still worth investing in Will, who is still young.
Actually, after Will's paintings were displayed on the school's web, someone looked for him to buy paintings.
The Neighbor's Dog was purchased by the last collector from Makizhou at a price well above the estimated price of Royal Art.
Some people think the collector of the Pashu is too passionate about the hair, faced with the hair, Pashu people always seem to be not calm enough.
Others think it's pure speculation, it's not about Will, it's about calling the dog, it's really unintelligible, it's like they're losing their minds.
In response, a special assignment was sent to interview the high-price buyer of the painting.
"Many people buy Will's paintings, and they're investing only in this guy, not in the paintings," said the collector in an interview.
I'm different. I'm looking at the painting, of course, for the dog in the painting.
I have a feeling that painting will be fired to the price.
"There's a really terrible sense of dogs by the people of the pasture. Humans are really weird creatures.
So, because of Will's "Neighbor's Dog" rolled up the hot search, and appeared in the headlines of the Queen's Time.
After the south wind left, the party turned over the news on the Internet, said to卷毛: "You don't go out these days, stand five minutes back to read.
It's only a six in the morning test to protect the animal see it again twice!
Chapter 450 Relocation
It took another two days to remember, with video and pictures, again and again to deepen the memory, both the old and the new centuries, to record the habits of those animals.
In order to get permission to swim freely in the sea early, rolled up again.
The last time I played it was to get my helmet.
Finally, the test scores from just passed, to 78, then to 90, and finally to strengthen the memory, can be successful.
Southern Winds thought that because of the Internet things are restricted to action, not to go out and walk, will have little emotion, didn't think that the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds.
Follow-up to the completion of the course and the completion of the final examination by the other participants in the course, the school organized a closing ceremony for the students who successfully completed the course of the Twelve Laws of the Arts.
There is no complicated link. Most of the people who have taken the Twelve Laws are not ordinary students.
The Closing Ceremony was held at the Royal Academy of Arts, where the Grand Master, as a family member, sat in the audience, watched the Grand Master's summons on the stage, tears filled his eyes, shook hands, took many photos and videos, and then sent them to his friends and to the chat group at the Hong Shui.
As soon as the closing ceremony was finished, the elder lord went quickly before the summons.
I look.
As if he had his own gold certificate, he smiled fast, took several high-definition photographs, and he handed it back to him.
Take it well. Don't get bitten by dogs.
We stopped all the old man, his grandson had a dog, and as soon as he didn't stop, the diploma that he had just gotten was dragged out and torn, and the glue didn't stick.
Grandfather looked at the hair.
Their eyes were as if they had been wronged by God.
Grandfather looked back and called to him, "Oh, you'll be fine in any case."
How many do you get every year?
The Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great
At least there's no one at home who's gotten this.
After attending the closing ceremony and taking enough photos, the elders were satisfied, and they had to go back for some time to stay in the kingdom.
Before leaving the Isle, Grandfather looked at the gentle and well-educated grandson, and without any restraint went to instruct Zheng Biang and Zheng Yu, "You must always protect the safety of the little summoner! I heard that there are many crazy fans, and the rivals also do by means, my little summoner is too good temper, not to prevent people, not to know the heart is dangerous.
Zhao:.
Do you remember what happened that year?
Do you know how his reserve officer came?
Do you know how he slaughtered people when he played games!
Don't know how thick the old man wears filters to say such a thing, or old memory decline selectively forget certain key things?
But in return, the summons now look a lot more gentle?
Isn't this art?
No matter what they think, Yan and Zhao Yu can only hard on the head of the other lord said, "Yes, sure to protect!
Grandfather left with satisfaction, waiting for him to move into his new home, and when he had time, he went to see his old home again.
Graduates are about to leave the school, but before that, the Graduates will make an academic conference report, the audience is mainly students.
It is not a formal academic conference report, but also a live channel, so that people who are not able to come to hear the report can watch it online.
He did not hide himself, and he shared his experience and skills during his year of training.
Two hours of academic reporting followed by four hours of interactive and signature activities.
Many also suggested that the faculty should stay at the faculty, so that the faculty's present strength and honours would be sufficient to become the faculty of the royal arts.
"Oh," said one of the students.
However, shortly afterwards, they found that the summoner, although gone, could always appear in the examination.
After completing one year of study, after leaving the royal arts, the party called back to Yanzhou simply pack up, and moved.
When the weather was right, the party moved from the center of Yanzhou to the seaside.
Probably smelling of the sea, the rabbit is especially lively today, moving in the tank, the two "ears" always want to explore outside.
Their plan was to make a large aquarium, to transfer the rabbit from the small aquarium to the large one.
Entering the new home Rabbits crawled into the aquarium, looking like a floating activity of cotton candy.
However, this cotton candy almost killed two burglars who entered the room.
It's a perfect.
Deadly is not only those colors too bright, but also those that look too cute.
The best thing about moving to a new home is the hair.
It finally finished the day before the move, ran and ran early today, urged the move.
He stared into the room, looking inside the game helmet one not leaked, and rolled up his own learning machine locked in the collection room, summoned to come out.
"The learning machine is also useful," he said.
Turmoil cried angrily and went out with his tail. Then he got excited and couldn't wait to visit the new plate.
Left.
Dogs are very conscious of their territory which is their nature.
Their new home was bigger, and they had a good look at it, and they waved to the other dogs in the residential area.
It's gonna stay here from now on!
When the party called to clean up, the darkness, let the three return, and let them two days off.
As soon as the three left, lay down at the door and ran.
"I want to swim in the sea," said the hair.
Just Swimmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Curly looked carefully at the face, " hungry.
Most of the time wasted by the emperor, and was only taken out by the emperor to find something to eat.
It's really hungry this year.
It was discovered long ago that the fat of the hair has been increasing.
Foods are also expanding.
Things that weren't interested in the past can now be smelled as if they're deciding whether to eat.
Once out, it smelled in the car for a long time, the south wind still thought the car was moved, nervous to stand the car to check.
Finally, it was found that the car had no problems with other stresses, except for some unknown scratches.
Later he asked, saying he was hungry, and had just smelled the food.
It knows what it can't eat, even if it's not seen, it can recognize.
It was unconditional to open to eat, now moved to a new house, hard to have the opportunity to open to eat once, of course do not want to leave, or do not want to continue to wait.
It's been there for a long time now, and it's been waiting for the three south winds to leave before it suggested going out and looking for food.
It's been a good day for the last two days.
Since the test has reached the requirement, the summon asks a few questions the hair can also answer quickly and accurately, let it out wave well.
It's easy to be noticed during the day, there's a community near the shore, and when you move today, you'll see people out of the sea on a yacht not far from you.
Wool chooses to go out at night.
"Yes," he said.
"I'd like to go and find something to eat," he said, "and I'll be back by eight tomorrow morning."
It's going to play a little more.
I think. I agree.
Take care of the weather,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes!"
Remember, you can't protect animals!
Don't eat!
Don't eat too!
I don't eat!
Let's go.
Permitted Turban Run out, under the cover of the night, into the sea.

Look at the far sea, put the dog chain on the door cabinet.
It's the first time I've put my hair out.
But he couldn't keep his eyes on him, and after such a long period of teaching he would like to give him a chance to go out on his own.
He will decide what to do next.
It's not a small thing, it's never relaxed its constraints, and if it's not guided, it can become a killer's weapon in the hands of some who have no mind.
There is no wrong with the people who use the weapon.
Having your own consciousness and perception is a complete living body.
Furthermore, the summons have always felt that his resurrection is related to the hair, but so far have not discovered what is.
Strictly protective, and guided.
But don't go wrong.
The wind was a little strong at night, and the waves brushed the shore, and then returned to the invisible.
Everything is full of unknown.
At the same time, I had no idea what to be worried about, at this time, as a real wild dog, wandering in the sea wandering.
O? Breath?
No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Blind breath blind water blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind blind
The coral can't eat, it goes to lick the stone next to the coral.
It's not good.
Seeing a turtle makes a joke.
It even sings.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
As a musician, can talk can sing.
Nobody's gonna hear anyway, don't worry about being found.
If it notices someone nearby, it will go deep or hide.
Despite being hungry, he did not open his mouth to eat after he entered the sea, but he intended to play first.
It's been going out for a long time now, and it's not being taken care of by anybody.
After chasing turtles and fish, ther was able to find a large fish, which still belonged to the new century marine protection group, but this did not reduce the ther's interest in it.
Protecting the animals can't eat, but don't say don't play ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
I don't eat but touch.
The fish accelerated, and as soon as the dog's legs were grinding, it followed closely, without thinking at all how it was a dog that grinded easily out of the flagfish.
After playing for a long time, the curler was hungry, and stopped to decide to eat something first.
It doesn't eat what belongs to the protective animals in the sea, it doesn't eat a fish fin, even if it can't be seen, it's also afraid.
After all, the first reaction in the brain was to read the books and the exams in the study machine, and to think face to face.
As for the protection of animals, it is not uncomfortable!
Let's go!
While excited, the hair is actually a bit confused.
Where do you come from?
As the first to freely hunt in the sea alone, the first hunt should be special, it should be the " ceremonial feeling" of the previous time the south wind?
Curls are looking carefully for today's first hunt.
It wasn't easy. It found one.
It looks like a fish in a conservation book, but it's just looking at a picture, it can see at a glance that the fish is different, it can quickly analyze the evidence, and even if it goes back to ask, it can answer with straightness.
Aside from protecting the animals, the caps act on the ground.
Although the predator is not big, less than one meter, it is very attractive.
The goal is clear.....
It's early morning.
There is still a tension in the area of anti-terrorism.
"The night patrol hasn't found any suspects, and the Voice hasn't found any suspect targets."
"Continue to strengthen the control of the target area, pay attention to patrol and close-sea detection, carefully select the small abnormal sounds and energy fluctuations, do not let one bird one fish!"
They were informed that the notorious "Tomorrow Empire" or "T" organization would launch an attack on Yanzhou at 2 a.m. Yanzhou time, they were only informed of the rough area and the exact location unknown.
Moreover, the T organization has stolen the latest kind of simulation technology, no one knows how the bunch of crazy did it.
At the same time, a hidden underground.
In the dark underground, only see the brightness of the screen.
78 people stand or sit and stare at one of the screens.
"We passed a patrol!" cried one excitedly, sweeping the bloody "T" marks on the nearby map with bloody eyes.
They came up with a new plan, the first of its kind, a test - to attack a port hundred kilometers from the city of Jiangsu using a newly developed simulated torpedo.
Although only one simulated torpedo was released, the high-energy was enough to destroy dozens of cargo ships in the port, causing a strong impact on the port.
Crossing those patrol boats in their expectation, back against the nearshore defenses is the key.
Come on, come on!
The man who holds the controller blinks at the point of light on the screen.
As he approached thermal defenses, he had to be more cautious, and to see if the new ones they had modified could succeed in deceiving the defenses of Yanzhou.
As soon as this attack succeeds, the follow-up will be immediately!
Everyone in the basement stared at the screen.
Just as we were about to enter the area of defense near Enzhou, while everybody waited to hold their breaths, the lights on the screen suddenly disappeared.
Everyone in the basement
For a moment they had a little doubt about themselves.
The man who holds the controller, the facial expressions are a little stiff.
What about me?
Look again, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone.
This sudden change made the basement a little nervous.
They thought of several possibilities, but there was no one in sight!
It's like a flower didn't come and turn. It's all over.
The psychological shock is too big for a time.
What's the matter?
"The simulated torpedo has lost contact! has not detected energy reaction! cause is unknown!"
"No!" "Isn't it a fault?"
"No," "The display," "The controller is," "but the torpedo does not respond!"
They've spent a huge amount of human and material effort, and spent a lot of time laying out the finished products!
Why did it disappear so silently?
"Have the near sea defenses been strengthened?
No No No
I don't believe!
The man who held the controller shaking lips, face twisted, full of bloody eyes filled with disgust and madness.
He can't accept such a failure!
Another, who had been sitting in the corner, with a dark face, said,Notify the others that all operations must be stopped immediately!
It took them quite a long time to develop the plan for the attack on Yanzhou, the first round, failed.
On the other hand, the Anti-Terrorism Department of Yanzhou also suspected.
Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait
There wasn't any movement.
The T group is not easy to stop, even knowing that leak will not stop, but will continue to be crazy in a provocative manner.
However, until dawn, they had no news of any unknown attacks.
There is calm on land and in the sea, and there is, of course, no blind area.
Why isn't it quiet?
It's weird.
Isn't the news wrong?
The night faded and the clouds brightened.
The sun shines on the sea, dissipates the coolness of the night.
Ha!
A dog's head came out of the water, the dog's nose sprayed, like suddenly remembering that he could breathe, exposed to the water moving, breathing in the morning moist air.
Slowly wandered to the beach, Dog Miso brought some flowers and sand.
She shivered after the shore.
"B"

Following his departure from Royalty, many looked to him for cooperation, and they felt that, once the training had been completed, business could begin.
However, it does not mean to participate in all kinds of business.
Despite being rejected, most people are not dying, the caller there can not find, after all, the caller has played before in the Queen's entertainment circle, knows many of his staff, contact the caller more easily than contact the caller.
So, I put myself a "part-time broker" title, energetic, and I ran with the work.
After summarizing his thoughts, the south wind summoned him, and he looked around without seeing any hair.
Their small team, except for the boss, is the wool the value of almost 300 million dogs, the south wind cares most.
What about the hair?
After moving to the new home, the hair is always high, why didn't see the shadow today?
He looked at the time and said,Go swim now come back.
The South Wind opened his mouth, and he thought, "Isn't it heartbreaking that you let a dog, worth almost three million, play in the sea yourself," but he finally did not dare.
With his papers in his hands, the south wind said,My boss, I'll go see the beach, and ran out.
Just outside the south wind received a call from Yi, asking how this side, whether he and left Yu come.
The south wind is looking to the beach.
At this moment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Under the sun, the south wind felt the reflected light of the dog's fur running with some metallic glow.
It's worth about 300 million dogs in our house! Even the sun gives us a metallic glow! The south wind sighed, taking pictures in the private chat group of their salty fish.
Zhao:.
The south wind continued: I've got the camera on you, have you seen? The running figure shines, and our little roll is the brightest cub in the whole area!
Zhong: It's also the most expensive
"The boss...
'The south wind,' said the boss,'I don't have time to keep an eye on the dog. We're supposed to keep an eye on it, especially when it's going to swim in the sea.'
He said the south wind ran towards the cape.
Curved by the south wind, shaking the wet dog hair.
P P
P P P
Curl has a burst and a fart.
The South Wind is excited, regret not to take the moment: "The first sight of dogs, worth close to 300 million dogs wow, no matter the burst or the fart, the breath is so long, a close smell, and a smell of smoke.
Zhao:.
The brain of the war friend has been deeply corrupted by money.
It's not saving!
The south winds like flowers "My dog is different from anybody else," the hairs over there have spread the dog's legs around the south wind, and have run back into the house.
Look at the time, 8:02.
Before he goes out, he calls his side and returns at eight.
It took more than two minutes.
The hair must defend itself.
"I got to the shore before eight! I just wanted to shake the water out of the house!
Hearing the sound of the south wind, he shut his mouth after two hums.
"I'll go to the dryer and dry the hair first," said the summoner.
As soon as the coat dried out, the summons had left the south wind.
He looked at the teeth, and there was nothing but a green trace of some kind of algae.
"How much did you eat this time?" he asked.
Speaking of this, therm came.I ate a fish, only one!The others were little snacks.
It's not enough to prove it's not enough.
It's been heard many times that raising pets cost money, especially those that eat much more, are easily thrown away.
The hair must be its own name.
It's not much!
Didn't eat one?
But he is familiar with the amount of hair.
'Really!' 'I'm not hungry!' said the hair.
Did you steal whales?
"No! I don't eat whales! I don't eat any other marine creatures! I don't eat any scales! The fish I've eaten is a little longer than I am, it's just like a marine creature, but it's not, I've seen it a few times, and I've confirmed it," said the buffalo.
This must be explained! It doesn't want to face the wall!
"What did you eat for snack?" asked the party again.
Two Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell
"Well.
There was nothing unusual about the hair, except that it was a bit of a spirit. He didn't know if the hair really didn't feel hungry or if he just said that, so he was going to drop him a bowl of dog food first.
As soon as I got up, I heard a burst of hair.
Their Steps Hold.
Carefully distinguish the smell of the air, the face becomes serious.
Put the dog's bowl on one side, the caller went before the lazy rolls, squatted and looked at the rolls.
Thinking about it, he asked, What are you eating today? Have you seen it in the book?
Curl:It's kind of like in the marine protection.
The summoned the electronic book to point the hair.
It's just a little bit like that, but it's definitely not! I can see it!
It also observed when hunting, remembering the difference between the fish and the protected fish on the map.
At the summoned, therapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprap
He took a pen and drew a picture according to the description of the hair.
From this "fish" turn, calls to compare maps and to understand all aspects of the situation, draw a line.
A thought,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Looking at the lines drawn and at the T on the fish in the picture, he asked the hair again, "What is the taste of what you eat?What is the hardness?"
"I don't know."
Everything bigger than me is swallowed.
He said:
It's a perfect logic.
From this point of view, hair follows a natural instinct similar to that of wild animals - to consume the lowest amount of body energy in exchange for the highest amount of energy intake.
If you can swallow, why do you have to swallow? And if you can't swallow, why do you have to do it?
Their faces weren't clear where they had gone wrong, and they kept arguing with caution: "I don't know what the taste is, but I feel its ingredients should be more complicated than dog food.
Probably more complicated than dog food! Wouldn't it be good to try it next time? The books I've read before don't say anything about the meat flavors that protect fish, or about the control groups I don't know if it's special compared to other fish that look like it.
It's about to finish.
Their eyes shifted from their notebook, and touched the dog's hair. No, you did well.
Reassment of the praised hair, the tail of cheer.
"What do you feel now?" he asked.
"How do you feel? "After eating that fish, it's like eating a compressed cookie.
"I don't have much to eat," he said.
I'm still not sure, but I'm going to do a simple check.
After moving to the new home, the instruments used to check the hair were moved together.
Test results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Previously, heavy metals in the blood were higher than in other dogs, but now they are swallowed by suspected torpedoes, and this is the only change.
This is astonishing.
If you look closely, the coat of hair, the brightness also seems to be slightly changed.
Previously, thermal winds have treated thermal winds with thermal winds, and there has never been such a glow, it thermal winds are not common chemicals that can be easily changed.
These are changes that occur overnight.
In case, therapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprap
"You don't have tos in these two days," said the commander.
"All right.
It's been a good time, and I've eaten too much, and I've been watching TV at home for the last two days!
"The next time you run away and find a fish that will fill you, if you really want to eat it, you should eat it, and don't bite it.
Come back and tell me.
"Well," said the tail with a glee.
Next time you're hungry!
He's hungry. He thinks he can eat for at least half a month!
This can save us a lot of money!
It's always burning after eating.
Chapter 453
Eating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was supposed to see around today. He also asked yesterday how to rent a speed boat.
When I finished my studies, I was going to relax and take a few days off to catch fish and bring some fresh fish to the rabbit.
However, the returns the party to give up the original intention.
Returning to the library, the summoner scanned the paintings that had just been drawn on the notebook, divided them into several screens in front, and opened the map of Enzhou, drew a region, and placed with the paintings in front.
"T" represents the organization of tomorrow's empire that always likes to attack and hates to bring down the century again, calls for the first contact with them, at the time of the White and the Star service.
Later, we met on the other side of Whale Island.
Looking at the three lines drawn on the map, the sides analyze the objectives of the other side.
As a man who has lived for nearly a century, he is still very sensitive to many things.
Some of the effects are already deep in the soul, and even a change of body, a change of background, a life of so long in the new century of peace, can not be eliminated.
The burst of hair, with the smell of smoke, almost in a moment raised the call of the nerve.
At the end of century,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He's got that micrometer on his leg that's tied to his hair, and if anything happens, he'll get a notification on this side.
A real-time monitoring result is displayed on the screen.
Just over an hour ago, the amount of heavy metal in the blood was rising rapidly.
No, it's acute change!
Several metals have risen steeply and decreased at great speed, and there have even been some heavy metals that should not have existed in normal dogs.
These metal elements should be brought by what is eaten today.
People also consume some unnecessary elements from food, but the situation is clearly not the same.
In less than ten seconds, according to measuring instruments, the content of some or other metal elements in the hair fell from the highest alert value to zero, and from zero to a staggering number!
None of the known creatures can make such a change!
For example, according to real-time measurements, this contains several heavy metal elements that are impossible to survive in a normal human body.
Can't be dog!
But it didn't lose its vitality, and it was able to hear its regular snoring.
This sudden change is not normal at all!
Is the detector broken?
Therapist came quickly to the cage of the cage, looked at the cage of the cage lying in sleep and snoring, paused, stretched out his fingers before the cage's nose, tried to breathe.
It is not a short nose, nor is it too fat, but it likes to snore, and it is recommended to take it to the veterinarian who checked, and nothing was found.
At this time, the snoring dog, breathing strongly, not rapidly, but thermal temperature is unusually high, much higher than the detector on the dog's leg.
As a warm animal, the temperature of the gas is more than the normal body temperature, is it normal?
They beat the dog's head.
"The hair?"
Therm continued to snore.
The game was stolen.
"No," he said.
Two loud voices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not long, continue to snore.
The more serious the call.
Didn't even the word game was stolen wake up?
Looks like it's been way more serious than you might think.
It's just that's never happened before, it's not even heard, it's not even known what to do.
Is it compulsion to wake up or to continue to watch?
He's not sure if there's going to be any harm if he's forced to wake up in this case, and he doesn't dare to act easily.
As thermal alarms became sharper and sharper, the changes on the personal terminal displayed were staggering.
Heart rate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's only detectable and we don't know how much it exceeds the detectable range.
The screen is flashing, the screen is like being pulled by some force, become distorted.
The light in the room also becomes unstable, flickering, as if encountering something in the interference.
An Emergency Alarm is an electrical connection that is working.
There was a sounding like a sounding like a sounding like a sounding like a sound sounding like a sound sounding like a sounding sounding like a sounding sounding like a sounding sounding like a sounding sounding like a sounding sounding like a sounding sounding like a sounding sounding like a sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding
There seemed to be a cold in the air.
Their intuition, from the wars of the end of the century, can clearly feel the unknown danger on the scalp, rapidly backwards and backwards.
The detector data acquisition interrupted, sharp alarm noise stopped.
The connection between the instrument and the individual terminal is disconnected.
The lights of the room.
The power plug is flashing current.
A cold light of metal suddenly appeared, a giant seeming to be a claw?
It's like a shadow and it's shot straight down.
Come on!
Dust and scraps of the ground were blown.
Suddenly there was a strong wind blowing up the curtains.
The entire three-floor building is shaking.
Then the light of the metal disappeared.
From appear to disappear, but blink time, like a hallucination.
Looking at the huge claw marks, and a crack of the floor, the summoner fell into silence.
There's a chair in the area that's covered with huge claws.

When buying a chair, South feels that wood is more up-to-date, and the new century wood furniture is a luxury.
But the seller also said that home dogs can choose a bit of solid furniture, especially the legs of the desk bench, unbearable.
That's why thermal wind picked the alloy.
It's solid.
But at this point, the high-end alloy chair, blown up by the seller yesterday, has become a cake, deeply embedded in the floor.
The rolls that was lying beside it, like suddenly awaken from a nightmare.
Looking with the eyes of the innocent dog, there was a confusion all around, and several large cracks in the floor were seen through the cracks.
Turtle jumped out of the dog's nest and cried with his teeth, "The enemy!
When he saw him, he ran quickly, stood beside him, and screamed at the huge nail marks that appeared in the room when he did not know.
Rear-pressed ears,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's awful.
"Oh!"
He said:
Chapter 454
The summons are really going to lower the rest period, however, the thing is not going to stop.
There was a lot of noise, and the security network of the property was located in the area, and after looking for noise, they quickly called to inquire.
Excuse me if you are in trouble. Do we need to send someone to help
"No, it's all about the dogs at home," said the commander.
The property smiled.
All right, you say it's a dog thing. It's a dog thing.
Apparently I believed.
The property will not continue to pursue, as long as it does not affect other residents, does not endanger the lives of other people, and does not make any sense to dismantle the whole of the home.
Even though the chamber was a little far away, the party had just moved, and many of them had noticed the movement of the Red Man of Yanzhou.
So, when the three south winds got the call fired, already others came to search.
A middle-aged merchant, holding a dog, said to come by a string of doors, eyes always carrying weight and suspicion.
The party did not let the other party into the room, but said that the room was more crowded, invited in the yard, and there were also table chairs.
"What's going on with the dog? Oh, I can understand your feelings, and some of the troubles are only understood by the people who have dogs."
After a while, the merchant felt that the information he had received was enough, and after a while he could not find anything, he took the dog away.
Turned around and said to the other friends in the neighborhood.
"He's a little quiet over there today," he said. "It looks like he's done a lot of shit.
I don't see a dog. I suspect he's just hit a dog.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

People who live in this movie don't want to bomb themselves in the media, they say it in private.

And there are those who look with cold eyes and think they have found the truth.
It's just a new house. Who's blamed for this?
They knew what the gang were discussing in private, but they had no intention of discussing it, nor of getting the south wind to rebuild the house, and this was a low-handed matter.
Their footprints were too obvious to be destroyed by the summons themselves, so that the floor that had been torn would be directly cracked.
The next day, this newly decorated little building, has to be changed again.
Zhao and Zhao are full of shame, such destruction force must have been robbed! It is their bodyguard's dismissal!
Even though they were given leave, the security facilities in and out of the house were arranged by their own supervisors, but a hair didn't help!
It's their responsibility, I'm sorry boss for the high salary!
The two were discussing how to upgrade the security system of the house.
The south wind pale face, shaking hands touched the board embedded in the chair.
What kind of force is there to beat a gold chair that is said to bear the weight of an elephant?
On the first floor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were murders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He did not dare to ask, neither did he intend to say, they could only hold all the questions in their hearts.
" boss, how many more people?" asked the south wind.
"No need."
He called for the south wind to deal with the repair of the house, and forth to the library in the corner hanging on the wall of the dog's head.
Before they were on the second floor, if they didn't, they would have collapsed.
Fortunately, moved home, if in the previous house, the inhabitants downstairs are uncertain about what impact will be.
After the summons came in, shut the door of the library, and shut the voice.
At this point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After the summons told him the truth, he was in a state of shock, far more shock than when he first knew he was playing the game.
Didn't you remember?
"I don't remember.
Curry never believes he's the kind of dog that breaks the house!
He pointed and took out a recording.
Although all the surveillance in the room is bad, but before it is bad, there is a recording, which is the kind of noise like an earring.
"Listen."
The hairy ears moved, and gradually, from believing that I was not such a dog, became somewhat hesitant.
"Hear," said ther.
Hasn't something like this happened before?
When was the last time you heard this?
When you were locked in.
He said:
I searched for memories of the time he was isolated.
"Whale Island?"
"Yes!"
What did you do then?
It swallowed the person.
But when I swallowed I washed up! Nobody found me!
"It's good.
Isn't there a similar situation? Think about it.
Wool recalled for a long time.
There seems to be one more, but I don't know when.
Their hair was not remembered, but they found one in their memory.
Once Will, in order to paint, to look for inspiration, to take a scroll to participate in the painting exhibition, but unexpectedly an accident, the scroll pulled Will out of the fire.
And that time, the place where the dogs were placed, the dog cages were all cut off, monitored all the strikes, until now have not found the perpetrators.
It only remembers when it bits the cage, and it's not clear what the monitoring is about.
Their hair didn't have that consciousness.
Even now, it is not known that every such change will destroy the monitoring.
From cutting the cage to destroying the surveillance, to the whale island directly swallowing people, to now suddenly turned into a big claw almost to tear down the building.
Within a short year, the change is increasing, suggesting that it is moving towards some form of change.
Like evolution.
Only how long this process will last, no one knows.
Nothing can be predicted.
More worrying is that change does not control itself.
What should be done next time something like this happens?
We've got to find someone else.
Thinking back to the size of the claws that cracked the floor, that was just one claw, if it had changed completely...
You can't fit in the house!
"What do you feel now?" he asked.
"I don't feel...
Doesn't itch my feet?
Their hair lifted one of their claws.
After the floor was ripped, the summoner looked at the dog's claws, which were presumed to have been exaggerated, and found only a few tiny marks.
Now, look at the dog's claws, all the marks are gone, the dog's claws seem to have been carefully maintained.
Then he said to his hair what he had to be careful about for a while, and he turned over his deposit, and he was worried.
It's hard to have a home.
With a helpless sigh, he called for the south wind.
Southern Wind is worried about how to repair the house while further strengthening. It was thought that the call to him in the past was to ask how to repair the house in a low tone.
"I want to buy an island," said the summoner.
South
What do you buy?
Boss, calm down!
Don't buy anything!
There seems to be no need to buy islands, even many foreigners know that private islands are devaluing!
There was a period when it was really popular to buy islands, and a group of merchants together raised the price of the islands. Later, due to environmental considerations, some of the islands were banned from selling, and the private islands that could be traded were fewer, and the price of the islands were higher.
However, outer star development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are more choices, and there are fewer.
If there is, then there is.
Nowadays there are many private islands to sell, but it is difficult to sell out.
If you want to make it easy to buy, as soon as you have the money, you can deal with it, and the islanders are very happy.
The south winds stopped the shock, cleared the voice, extruded a smile, to analyze the present situation of island trading.
"It's always going down," he said. "It's hard to sell out.
Some of the people who have been to buy the island, have bought it for a long time, do not know how many pesticides there are on the island, it is dangerous, the cost of the island is high, the cost of the initial investment is high..."
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
Hearing the analysis of the south wind, he said,The cape needs a larger space of activity.
The South Wind looked at the, and could not see half the meaning of laughing at the.
It's already decided, the south wind can only meet.
All right, I'll make a list of budgets.
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
South decided to go back and buy himself an insurance.
He's trying to ask: Do you regret giving out so much money? If you don't give out, just deal, don't say a small island, buy a group, don't say anything!
The South winds in his heart, while searching online for private islands to sell, screened for houses and small islands with a parking lot.
He estimated, and after buying a small island, the pledged savings came to an end.
If it's for other reasons, the south wind can understand, but if it's really for dogs, it's too...
On this day, he summed up from his boss an experience of life-being a pet makes a man poor.
CHAPTER 455 Nobody knows what a stranger is
This Star Island is good to buy, lots to choose from, South Wind has chosen a few, to call.
One of them was chosen.
There was a buyer looking for an inquiry, the owner was excited.
He has seen more and more people invest in foreign stars in the last two years, and he is too hasty to throw out the island as soon as possible, and he has taken a step back when negotiating the price.
The deal quickly, the previous day to inquiry, the next day to settle.
Seeing the summoned so quickly to complete the procedure, the south wind filled with helpless: the summoned the man will not invest, he needs a wise investment adviser.
I don't know what happened in that house, but what else, not so much as to hurry to buy the island?
Well, the boss is going to his music, to invest too much.
It's not just south, it's also the old master who thinks it's stupid.
Isn't it foolish to look at a star island in a downward trend and run to buy?
He's too young to move.
Their newly purchased islands are not too large, but they are quite active.
Their position is far from each of the continents, and their shape is not characteristic, and their roots are not known.
And the original owner hasn't been living for nearly twenty years, so it's just a year to send people past a simple clean two, very ecological island.
The catastrophe of the century is sweeping the world, there is no out of the world peach source, the small island here also experienced the theft of the century century, and over five hundred years, has been restored to today's flourishing.
The existing houses on the island were built more than fifty years ago, and later because storms are too frequent, upgraded twice, the call is not too active, firm, enough to live on.
As soon as the security system is put in place, the party calls for the three south winds to return to life.
The small island is not large, food is limited, is mainly from outside, the party summoned some of the goods, after every time, the lack of the goods, let the Yan Biang and the left Yu to bring them.
After the following royalties were paid, the company purchased two aircraft, which only operated in the atmosphere.
I just got some drums. I see the bottom again.
All three of the South Wind looked at him. They all had a feeling "Is my boss crazy?"
The two newly bought aircraft, one on the island, and the other one on the south wind for the three of them to carry the goods
"The boss you... stay here alone?" asked Zhao with no confidence again.
"Well," he said, "the summons seem to be very calm.
"Isn't it necessary to strengthen the people?
"No need."
"Then...
Boss, if you have anything to do, contact us immediately.
The south wind three turns on the aircraft.
Looking at the three south winds leaving the aircraft, call back to the house, will have been shrinking in the wool of the dog.
Now therapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprap
The fish I thought could withstand for half a month, I didn't expect, less than a week, and felt a little hungry.
We pulled out a big bag of dog food. 50 kilograms of stuff.
"You eat," I said, "I'll watch you eat."
Can I swallow directly?
"Yeah.
He licked his nose and walked to the bag of dog food.
Then the summon saw, as if suddenly appeared a big... mouth?
The silver metal flashed cold.
That 50 kg bag of dog food is gone.
"Are you hungry?" he asked.
Curry hesitated and pointed at him, Or... a little hungry.
That's why he's not eating enough.
He brought out another bag of 50 kg of dog food. "Can you slow down this time?
Curry's head wasted this time.
This time the call is clearer.
As the dog's head changes, the rest of the body remains in the normal dog's form.
The little curved dog's hair at that moment seemed to shrink back into the curved body.
The shape of the changing dog's head was somewhat blurred, like some kind of metal composition, and it was not clear what it was, but one big mouth with sharp teeth, opened and swallowed the bag of 50 kilograms of dog food.
Easy.
Don't say 50 100 probably don't have half a stop.
He stared at this.
Perhaps the dog can't simply identify with carbon life.
There may also be another form.
Usually it's a dog. What is a metal dog? Unknown metal forms life?
The camera that was just placed in the room, without any accident, the only part that was recorded, from the beginning of the change, has been interfered with.
Looking at the surveillance at other locations in the house, the nearest is where there is a serious fault, where there is less than 20 meters of fault, but there is also a tearing and twisting of the shot at that moment.
All electronic devices are affected.
There's a lot to prepare for the move.
Unbeknownst to himself, the electronics were no longer used, so the party called to the warehouse and searched, removing the test mirrors left by the original master.
Their hair swallowed the mirror once again, but this time it nearly choked.
It was almost pissed off by the way it looked in the mirror.
Indeed, without a mirror, do not know what is strange!
Their shock is greater than when they know they are going to break their home in their dream!
It's just that's going to be replaced by hunger.
A few times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm hungry.
You're hungry!
I can't,I ran to the sea for food.
There were no other inhabitants around this time, and they did not have to wait for the evening, and after they had been summoned, they rushed into the sea to find food.
It's like opening a switch, over the next period, the hair changes more and more frequently, sometimes playing with a hole, suddenly the claws become bigger, and dig out a hole.
Their orders weren't afraid to let them sleep in the house, or what if they accidentally dreamed of chasing the thief, and were excited to destroy the house?
And accompanied by this frequent change is a huge energy demand.
Food!
There's really no solution, only let the hair itself run in the sea to find food.
There are some important questions, which are always emphasized with the hair.
Every day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just one can't last for half a month, not for a week, and if changes are too frequent, you'll have to go out again for about two or three days.
Ribbons are also very happy to eat once and save money.
However, after swallowing the third simulated torpedo, it was no longer found, rolled up to the nearby sea of Yanzhou and ran back and forth several times, never again met.
It is known that T may have abandoned the use of simulated torpedoes.
It's not knowing what people are going to do next.
Yan's counter-terrorism has done well, and even if they don't have hair to swallow the torpedoes, the chances are that the torpedoes will be intercepted.
There's no torpedo.
This time it's going to go a little further.
With neither consent nor objection, the summoner handed over a set of comprehensive test papers, which he himself put out.
It involves dealing with all kinds of emergencies and some things that have been stressed over and over again.
T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T
With the seven, the summoned again to do the lesson, and then agreed to roll out.
This time was a little longer, and after twelve hours came back, very spirited, and seemed to have eaten enough.
"What are you eating?
"Eat a big box! "
To sum up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also asked some details about the place where they found "food" this time, a submarine that sank in the deep sea, and what they called "food", inside the submarine, should be some kind of high-energy material.
Eight big boxes.
Because it's a bit far away, it can't control the changes of the body, and can't bring the box from the depths to be seen.
When he swallowed the first box, he felt full, and thought of taking a box back to the party to see what, and when he took it, he swallowed.
It didn't want to swallow the third, it had a summon, it didn't dare to violently bite the box, only to return to the island.
"It's good," said therap.
It's hard to meet when you're hanging.
Without a diver, the summons can not see, can only guess by the description of the hair.
This information is not enough, the sinking submarine does not know how long ago, and the cape does not know, can not draw, can only wait for the cape to provide the clue when it is looking for food.
The effect is remarkable after the hair is eaten.
From not being able to control the sudden changes, to the vague sense of the changes, before each change, can avoid unnecessary damage, the island no more suddenly pits.
Only the more frequent, the more intense.
In order to prevent aerial patrols or outer space satellites from detecting abnormal energy fluctuations, they are summoned to run into the sea whenever they feel they need to change.
There is no effect on the land or on the sea.
Over the next month, he ran out several times and swallowed the remaining boxes in the sinking submarine.
Based on the information returned from the envelope, combined with the clues found, it is essentially certain that the submarine of the T organization, which was sunk a hundred years ago by the Yanzhou Navy, and also rumors that on the submarine that sank, there were at least eight tons of A-class energy minerals...
Many people have tried to rescue, not the submarine, but the eight tons of A-class energy minerals inside.
However, they were ineffective, where they were easily swallowed by thermal currents, attacked by deep-sea organisms, said to be in the magnetic abnormal zone, communications were easily interrupted, and submarines were easily damaged.
It's not worth it for an unknown fake.
Gradually, people forget the sinking submarine, and the legendary eight tons of A-class energy mineral.
Looking at the reason that year the Yanzhou Navy suddenly moved, the side summoned silence.
It's complicated.
CHAPTER 456 The Small Island is a signal
It didn't think so much, and after eating all eight boxes, it didn't feel dead, and ran a few more rounds, and didn't find that box again.
It says don't swallow the underwater creatures, just scare them, don't eat.
It can only eat a few of the remains of the submarine, especially the energy cabin.
Above the sinking submarine, three fully armed submarines, cautiously approach the area of the ditch, which has been demonized by people.
Increasingly close to the myth of the Deep Danger Zone, they did encounter several communications interferences, so that they did not encounter strong underwater dark currents during the dive.
The extreme environment of the bottom of the submarine is somewhat restricted, gives a very uncomfortable feeling of depression, and fear of this unknown world.
Humans have gone into space, into other planets, yet still do not completely dominate the oceans, many places in the deep oceans, still are prohibited.
A::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
"I didn't find any danger," he said. "It looks like we're lucky today."
They didn't think they'd be able to do it once. This time it's a trial.
Who would have run here without being forced to do so?
Strangely enough, the three simulated torpedoes they fired back and forth, they all disappeared from the world.
All three fish attacks failed, making them more and more reluctant to defend the nearby sea of Yanzhou.
When it's so powerful that's a creepy stop!
I didn't even hear!
People in other areas of T immediately stopped the simulated torpedo attacks to explore the interception technology.
They have reason to doubt whether the cloning technology stolen from the army is a bug, or whether the army specifically planted it and then stole it from them!
In order to steal the technology, they lost many, exposed several points.
Now it seems that is a ring against their conspiracy!
It's a trick!
Their side, too, now has to change the original plan, the top of the organization has been very dissatisfied with the people in their Yanzhou branch, if they do not make some progress, they will not get into the organization, and the consequences are terrible.
Either make an attack or do something else.
After losing three precious torpedoes, the above temporarily cut off most of their financial support, recovered all torpedoes, stopped the original plan, seems to be going to dry them for a while.
Head of the T organization Yanzhou, has recently become bald.
I'm thinking about finding more people, for example, in some of the unrestricted markets in Yanzhou.
But also worried about destroying the organization's other plans, recently the organization seems to be doing more, but they are not getting the message.
Each department's operations are separate and can't find out the exact information.
Besides, the people of the Yanzhou Military District are now watching them closely, estimated to have been stopped before the mall.
You can't do it. You can only do it by looking for other ways, for example, by means of materials.
When he wanted to, he placed the object on the submarine that had been sinking for a hundred years.
One of his predecessors was in the sinking submarine, one of the people responsible for transporting energy minerals, but unfortunately later encountered the Yanzhou Navy, could not escape smoothly, in the end even the people with the submarine were blown up, one of the people in the submarine could not escape.
Eight tons of class A energy, followed by sinking into the sea bottom.
Eight tons!
How long did you save to get eight tons of A grade energy minerals!
It's all over!
The event was also a great blow to the organization, wasted for a long time, too low, entered a period of restful life.
Since then, the organization has never transported more than two tons of ore.
Unfortunately, those who were in charge of the shipment did not want to encounter the Yanzhou Navy's interim exercise, which was supposed to be held on the anniversary of the death of a great Yanzhou man.
They didn't get any news before, too suddenly, when they hear the news, they're all confused.
Yanzhou Navy!
What's the name of the great man of the century?
Like a Surname?
Whatever he calls, he is dead.
It is said that year organized many plans to burn the cemetery, but the helper to the cemetery was too difficult to deal with, never succeeded.
T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T
In some hidden underground, the head of the T-organization's Yanzhou branch, blindly commanded the rescue operation.
If it wasn't possible, he wouldn't have put the target on this 100-year-old submarine that's been sinking in the ditch.
Although the price of the A- with the discovery of more energy mines, the price of the A-energy mines has dropped slightly, it is still worth about 1.4 billion.
Communications technology is improving rapidly, and although recovery operations have been interrupted several times so far, it is still largely good.
Looking at the approached the target, didn't encounter the darkness of the sea, didn't encounter the attack of the deep sea creatures, indeed, the gods are helping him!
"Watch out for deep sea monsters."
"Okay, but old, is there really a legendary beast here?" asked one of the divers.
"I don't know."
"The area we're near is very quiet.
Until this depth there were no fish, nor any deep sea monsters, dead water.
It's just a few shots, I'm not sure if it's a mythical giant, or there's a rumor that it's a fake.
In fact, they believed there were deep sea monsters.
Everyone in the three submarines that were carrying out the rescue mission was more alert.
There is a sinking submarine!
It's been a hundred years since the submarine first came in.
"Find the rock first!" ""Find the rock first!" ""Find the rock first!" ""Find the rock first!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Good old man!
The men in the three submarines were also excited.
Eight tons of grade A, worth one hundred forty million!
You'll get this ticket!
Three Diving Vessels One Operations Vessel Two Protection Vessels.
Just...
"Well, old man, I haven't found any ore.
"The boxes are made of special materials and are difficult to detect.
Eight tons of ore should be packed in more than eight boxes.
After a few minutes, the diver reporting the mission.
Old man, the submarine is badly damaged, with only remnants, and the edges of the sections cut out are incomplete... like being bitten by a dog.
"That's not a good laugh. "The end of the communication is frozen.
Apparently the mood is not very good.
Old man, I looked at it again, it's really a bit like a bite, it's really a deep beast!
Isn't it easy to bite a submarine like this?
To be honest,they'd rather go to Yan's tomb than feed fish here.
Find the box! cried the communicator.
"Yes!"
Ultimately, the eight tons of grade A ore defeated the fear of the deep sea monster.
However.
Old man, I didn't find the box! There's no room here, there's no room for this big piece of submarine!
A heavy breathing sounded from the transmitter.
It's probably not light enough.
I always feel like doing nothing during this time.
Find again! Find nearby!
Go Go Go
?
What are you saying? I can't hear!
Connection disconnected.
But they didn't panic, and in the process they also encountered several communication breaks, just wait for a while.
However, wait, communications are not restored, the control system of the submarine seems to be in trouble, and more and more.
Everyone in the three submarines was in a panic.
Get out! Get out! Get back to the shallow!
The submarine is more and more uncontrolled and insensitive to operation.
They took control of the submarine up to the point where the submarine's operating desk suddenly seemed to be powered out, a complete strike.
There was a sounding like an ear, and consciousness began to fade.
On the other side, the call is talking to the south wind.
He received many invitations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their mission was greater than the South Wind, but they were not complaining, but they were happy.
Their call for another salary, of course, which is not the most important, and the important thing is that the South Wind knows more people, which is good for his future career.
"Then I'm going to throw out the show, and I'm going to take only one interview on Enzhou TV, and I'm going to work with..."
Before the souther had finished, he heard the sound of the whirlwind, and soon the communication was completely cut off.
The South Wind said to Zheng and Zhao Yu: Let me say, like that isolated little island is a bad signal, always unstable.
The three southerners were afraid of losing contact with the caller, and had intended to take a look, but had received a warning from the Enzhou Coastal Monitoring Station, saying that there had been a weak earthquake near a sea ditch, that there had been a serious magnetic abnormality, and that the people who had gone out of the sea had been asked to avoid the area as much as possible, and to wait for everything to return, if not necessary.
We can't.the three south winds can't wait.
Weak earthquakes are nothing, magnetic abnormality is very trouble, who knows when abnormality will be deepened, what if flying to half all operations uncontrolled?
"Oh, it's so good in the city, why should the boss move to the small island?"
At this time, on the small island.
After the communications were interrupted, the summon found all the displays appear familiar flashes.
Get out of the house and look out to the sea.
There's a change happening.
CHAPTER 457 Dogs also have goals
The disturbance lasted for nearly two hours before disappearing, and the caller received their call, and gave a message of peace, but did not allow the three to come now.
Instead of immediately returning to their home, they sat on a shore stone and watched on the Internet reports of this offshore magnetic abnormality.
There were no casualties, as nobody was active in the region with the strongest magnetic abnormalities, and the earthquake was weaker, and the public was almost blinded to the news.
After a few minutes of news, the summons heard that something under the water was approaching at an extremely fast speed.
He didn't hide. He summoned himself to look past.
S S S
A dog jumped out of the sea, too fast, or maybe too excited, to land not steady, rolled for a long time to stop.
She threw away the water and the sandstones, rolled up her hair, and ran to her side, looking very excited, with her tail throwing out.
Didn't find any marks on his hair, he touched the dog's head, "Are you fed?"
It's full!
That's a very strong voice, with a little bit of pride.
"What's going on? You've got a bit of quiet this time.
Their calls for a few pieces of news about the event.
Looking at the news, he felt a little sad, but found that there were no serious incidents, and put down his mind.
"Can you change now?" he asked.
"Yes," said therapist.
Although there were no others on the island, due to this magnetic abnormal event, the satellite estimated to be closer and always more careful.
Go to the sea.
Their team changed their diving clothes and took their equipment and went to the farthest.
First, to avoid being detected by satellites, Second, to avoid being affected by electronic equipment on the island, stocks are not enough.
Wait for some distance from the island, dive under the water, the summon to make the hair turn.
The sun passes through the sea, shines into the water, can see some stars in the sea floating material.
There were fish of all sizes floating around on the fin.
There was a sudden fluctuation, and the fish fled in a panic.
Under the sea, a huge creature suddenly appeared, with a metal sharp and cold feeling.
The sun shines through the sea, reflecting the dark light.
The shadow with the flow of the sea, add a bit of mystery.
He has two ears,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's not even its dog.
Look at the size of the dog's mouth, swallow a man really gently.
He couldn't have imagined, as he looked at the strangeness before him, how the fur could turn from a carbon-based creature that looked like a small pet dog into a new creature that seemed to be made entirely of metal, and in the instant that had just changed, he even heard a high-frequency sound that seemed to be moving at a mechanical speed.
Wait for it to stabilize this new form before opening the underwater phone.
"It's very cool.
Can't be smaller?
"No," he said
The hair twisted its big head thought, "Not now, not later.
Now I can control deformation! I just can't keep it for long.
"I don't have to eat much anymore if I don't become like this," he said.
It looks like it's not so hungry as long as it doesn't turn into this big shape, so it can save dog food!
Their hair quickly returned to the look of a little dog.
It thinks finally solved a big problem, finally no more trouble!
There are still many questions to be asked, but this is not the place for a detailed discussion.
Returning to the shore, he entered the house.
After eating without a box, after eating the submarine, I went along the ditch, and I smelled the food deeper, and I dug it out and ate it.
"What's the food?" asked.
"It's a stone, white, round, big like a football."
More hair doesn't come out, it doesn't pay much attention when it presses, when it's too hungry, it digs out and eats.
It is speculated that may be a new kind of energy mineral, which is very likely to be higher than the energy contained in grade A energy minerals.
The stone in the ditch is either the original of the planet or the stone that fell out of the sky.
During thermal period, there were also many meteors, including energy minerals.
Calls tend to fall out of the planet.
But now the stones are swallowed up and it's really hard to identify the date.
Just make sure the stone is good for the hair.
"Isn't there some kind of stone?"
No! There is only one.
Wool also regrets that if there were more of these stones, it would not have to spend money to buy dog food, it can play in two forms every day.
It's a pity that's not enough.
The Order did not hold the question, but the question of the magnetic abnormality and the cause of the earthquake.
Take a careful look, leaning slightly on the dog's head, and argue for himself, "I can't hold too much.
Having eaten the submarine's energy cabin, and swallowed a stone that was supposed to be a high-energy mine, the cape suddenly realized that it was again deformed, and found a place to hide quietly waiting for the period to pass.
"I didn't think I'd be able to do it this time. I was looking for nobody around, and there were no more fish in the ditch.
Think of it, rolled up his eyes, shook his tail, and said, After I've passed through my transformation, I've found three submarines not far from here, all with men and all with signs of life, and I'll give them to the nearest naval ship!
I slipped through the submarine and was not found!
Just at this time the party calls concern accounts with new news.
Take a look.
It states that the Enzhou Naval Patrol has found three submarines and has identified all of them as members of T. The information on the submarines is the center of the earthquake and magnetic abnormality.
People also doubt that extraordinary event at sea was made by T, you know what is being called T now.
It took him a long time to look at the unknown, twisted head, which was scratching with its hind leg, and to say, You have handled this very well!
He wasted his mind, and wagged his tail to praise, looking with hope at the summons.
So I I can I want a game?
"Yeah.
Actually, there are some things that can be prepared in advance.
Two boxes from the side of the warehouse.
The first box is equipped with game helmet.
Their eyes were straightened as they looked at the brand new game helmet.
Real Game Helmet! Not a deceptive learning machine!
He opened the second box, smaller than the first.
Inside is a wristwatch-style personal terminal with a little dog tattoo.
Their attention shifted from the game to stick to this new personal terminal.
This is the end it's been thinking about for a long time!
Their hair licked their noses, and their tails rolled up nicely.
"Which one do you want?
Curl eyes hard on the game helmet and personal terminal, selecting difficulty like there a low voice whispering.
"Well, there's still a problem," said the party.
He opened his innocent eyes, and looked at him with pity.
"Whatever it is," said the commander.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
The summons began to show evidence, from the time the rubber was removed to the data collected from the most recent magnetic abnormal event.
"You'll interfere with electronics every time you deform," he said.
Faced with evidence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However," the summoner said, "I see that you have made great progress over this period, from not being able to control the changes in your body from the beginning, to now being able to control the complete deformation of your body, and I believe that you will soon be able to deform without affecting electronic devices."
When the listened to say this, the hair was confident again.
It's given time to make choices on the assumption that it can control its own influence on electronic devices.
Curls soon enter a new training period.
Dogs also have goals have power and direction.
Otherwise, it just wants to eat today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Therapist packed up the warehouse, tolerated the appearance of the curls.
Even if the hair is accidentally exaggerated, it is not about to break the house.
Exercise each day to feed cans, fruits, bones, etc., each to one, will try to reduce interference.
It now has more control over body changes, only the head changes, the release of interference is not so big as before, will not directly let the nearest electronic equipment waste.
The test mirror was sent back to the warehouse.
Curls occasionally take a look at the mirror to see their new form.
You can see yourself in a mirror.
To deal with this side of the roll, the side calls for the three south wind supplement.
Though there are plenty of fish in the sea, there may be energy minerals in the sea bottom, but there are still plenty of resources available.
With the orders, the three south winds are full of suspicion, this call to supplement too much, dog food cans not say, to feed the hair.
It's just, there's so much fruit, so much meat, so much compressed biscuits, that there's only one left to eat on the island?
Looking at the shopping list, South said to Zhang Biang and Zhang Yu: "I suspect the boss stole a shark...
Or any other fish? Oh, look at the quantity of this shipment, there may be more than one.
CHAPTER 458 A dog that takes a stick of bones is a good dog
The boss has a secret, but the three south winds do not dare to dig deep, they do not want to lose their jobs.
When they brought their supplies, they didn't train in the warehouse, but they lay down on their sofas and watched TV.
The south wind of finishing the goods looked back and laughed, Oh, the little hair is watching TV again?
After finishing his work, the south wind relaxed his muscles and ran over to watch TV with his hair on the sofa.
There is a dog show where the owner is proud to show off his dog.
"There are dogs. There are lands," he said, "and there are people in the pasture."
"Oh, look at the shepherd in there, and bring a present to the owner! Look at the owner laughing so much! I tell you, the dog that brings the bone rod to the owner is a good dog, and when do you bring one to the owner?
He knew that wise man was like a child, and could hear simple words and commands, so that he was a wise man, and after he had spoken, he did not think about it.
Well, I'll roll my ears, look at the south wind, watch the show on TV, lie down on the sofa and don't know what I'm thinking.
Boss, the goods have been loaded, the electronic list has been sent to you, you check, said Yu.
It's hard.
"Wouldn't you like to have a home robot next time?
"Not for now," he said.
Do not put too many electronic devices before the hair can fully control its interference.
After a while, the three south winds left.
The horse jumped up on the sofa and cried to the side: Let me go!
"Out of the door?"
Not far from the beach near the island.
It's not straightforward.
Their eyes moved, and when they saw that the dog had little, they said, Let's go.
"Wang! I'll be back soon!"
He wants to see what the dog is going to do.
It's Mo.
Since the beginning of thematic studies, thematic studies have been conducted with the help of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.
Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call
Before he asked if he had any trouble, whether the magnetic abnormality had been affected, he asked if he had hired more people, that the Yanzhou Navy had just captured a number of terrorists at sea, he was worried about the safety of the convoy.
Of course, this time Morang called, one after watching the news to worry about the safety of the call, the other to tell the call an important message.
"There's an important performance, which is invited by very famous musicians, and the organizer is looking at you, do you not want to go?
Listening to Moran, it came to mind that, at the end of the concert, one of the judges had mentioned an important performance, probably one that could not be made public.
"Are you the organizer?"
"The Army. There's still some way to go."
"Go."
With a smile, the other called the reply very satisfied.
"It'll be good for you later.
Someone will contact you if there are any problems you can ask him directly when you come.
You have about a month to make arrangements for the star.
"Yes," he said.
One month should be enough.
It's not yet clear which of the stars he's going to be on, but if he's going to be on, it's not three or five days away, and if he's not going to be looking at him personally, he's not going to be safe, but he's going to be risky, and he's going to have to see what he's going to do for the next few days.
If you can control and not interfere with the electronic equipment, the summoner will take the hair to the performance.
Of course,the premise is that the organizer will allow the dog.
Even if you don't have a dog, as long as you can handle the capability, will not be easily exposed.
With the stimulation of the game helmet and the personal terminal, the progress of the last few days has been obvious, and has reduced the range of interference to within the warehouse, outside the warehouse, where the interference of electronic equipment is little or no.
He talked to Morang for a few more hours after the end of the conversation.
Their hair hasn't come back.
"The hair?"
A few voices came out of the room.
I didn't hear back.
Listen carefully.
There was a sound of underwater rock near the island, like it was digging a hole.
No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He saw the legendary work of the past, "The Dog of Su".
It was written by ancient war friends.
As the leader of the field, Su's influence is not small, his speeches and stories are collected and written by the people of the field.
This book is about how to raise dogs, of course, only part of what is said by the dog, the rest of it is later analyzed and expanded.
Their love for dogs is also influenced by their ancestors.
Nevertheless, he was the first dog to be recognized on all the battlefields of the last century.
He felt he had much to learn from this old war friend who had a lot of doging experience.
Even if it turns into a mechanical dog, it's still a dog, and the core isn't changed.
As he looked, the summoner heard the silence on the shore.
Their hair came out of the sea, without considering the water that had been thrown at them, and they ran along with a bone that was much bigger than the dog's head.
When he saw the bone, his eyeballs jumped.
Probably afraid to bite the bone, especially careful when carrying the hair, in a position close to the top of the lion, slowing down to carry the bone five or six times larger than it.
Until he came to the summon, he had put down the fracture.
There were teeth on the bones, and there were cracks.
As a dog that can easily be swallowed up by a submarine, this is already the result of trying to control the hair.
After laying down the bones, curls much lighter, shakes the hair, throws away the sea on the body.
"The bone is too soft! It breaks when you touch it! It's not too hard in the stone! I saw bones in the stone last time I was digging under the sea, but they were not delicious, nor very hungry.
But it's big!
It's got a lot more bones than the dogs on TV!
It's awful!
After touching his dog's head, he picked up the bones that were in front of him.
The bone is not a whole root, it is cut by the hair, the cut surface can see some granular crystals.
Part of the bone is also attached to the stone, the hair to dig the bone will not do more fine work.
There are traces on the bone, like blood vessels.
Fossil!
A skeleton of a giant living tens of millions of years or even billions of years ago!
Destructive Disasters and Hundred Years of War Destroyed too many things, Survival is the first, All others are left behind, Anything can be the victim of that Hundred Years of War Survival.
At the end of the end of the century, the new century people began to think again, to be fascinated with the prehistoric beasts, they also tried to dig again, often only to find the remains, can dig to the complete skeleton can be the treasure of the museum town, enough for them to boast for many years.
The large skeletons found in various museums are mostly made of preserved ancient materials, and not of real skeletal fossils!
And according to nearly 20 years of fossil trading records, a tooth of a meat dinosaur 70 million years ago could hold a room of more than 100 square meters in downtown Zion, Yanzhou!
"Well, you've got your dog food."
CHAPTER 459 Their Approaches to Headlines Are Different
It really doesn't feel any better than the bone, nor does it feel any better than hunger.
However, it seems to have a very good taste of the gift.
Standing up with his chest waiting for the caller to continue to boast, he listened to the caller and said, Within a week, if you are able to control electronic devices that are less than a meter in change, the terminal and the game helmet can be given to you.
Their hair washed away by the surprise, and immediately jumped up again, shaking the tail to confirm.
"Well, start counting now."
Take off your hair and run to the warehouse for practice.
Theraptor put down the bones he had brought back, put on his diving suit and his equipment, and went into the sea, to the place where he had dug the hole.
The sea around the island is not too deep, there is a lot of dog scratching underneath, from moving up to now, the hair often plays with the underwater scratching hole around the island.
Their holes in the bones are small enough to allow them to enter themselves, and they do not use tools to dig, but they take out a small energy wave transmitter.
Without a professional probe, the summons can only judge the general situation in the rocks first with their own ears.
Listening carefully to the changes in the rock, at this time the brain called as a layered imaging instrument, to depict the general situation in the rock.
There are many interferences in the rock, but there is a preliminary understanding.
After returning to the shore, the party made marks on several grounds and brought excavation tools.
Of course, he did not intend, by himself and with his limited tools, to dig out the giant fossils that had been buried beneath for a few years, he merely wanted to do some work first, to distract others, and to cover up the "abnormal" traces that had been left in the process of caping the fossils.
Over the next few days, the summons were doing this work, and it was good to hide the giants below, large enough that some could be dug directly on the island, but dug a little deeper.
On the other side of the reel, there is a double stimulation of the game console and the personal terminal, which is just a speed of progress, it doesn't take a week, it reduces the range of interference to within a meter in five days, and then it can't wait to run to the summons and ask for a reward.
Game Machine!
Personal Terminal!
How long have you been waiting?
It's good not to make choices!
He didn't deceive therapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprap
"The two things you normally do, don't get too close to change.
Remember to get the terminal down before the change. The caller will wear the dog ring with the terminal.
"Oh," said therap.
These words are not spoken, but it is not easy to get the reward!
Dog first belongs to its own game and terminal, not really protect what to do!
After wearing this special necklace, he ran to the mirror in the warehouse and photographed the mirror for nearly two hours.
Game helmet It is familiar, the terminal first contact, but the operation is very simple, it remembers to read the electronic manual written to it, it then finds the summons not to run in front, can speak directly through the terminal ~
As therm ran to therm, therm repeated the instructions for use of the children's special terminal, deleted.
But it took only five days to reduce the interference range to within one meter, and indeed beyond his expectations, it seems that the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the
We'll have to raise.
After settling the matter on the side of the cape, the side calls the three south winds, directly opened a voice group talking.
After receiving a call, the three south winds did not dare to delay, and put their hands down to wait for the boss' orders.
The three guessed the boss usually contact once a week, now it's been five days, is the thing on the island finished?
No,that's what happened last time,that's enough for him to eat and drink for a month.
What happened?
But I don't have to look at the boss like that.
Or...................................................................................................
The three restrained themselves from their doubts and waited for the word.
"The hair cut off a bone," said the summoner.
The south wind is excited: My house will take bones home!
Left Yu directly ignored the south wind, " boss, human bone or animal bone?
That was the face of the awake south wind from the mindless blow, "Yes, is it
According to the purchase contract, this island is not a dead island, since the previous owner bought, there is no accidental death, after all, the former owner has not lived anything, except simple renovation and house building, and there is nothing buried here.
Mo, is there anything that the former owner doesn't know about?
If it's just the bones of birds and beasts that don't connect to them.
The three looked as if they weren't afraid, and waited patiently for the next word.
Their initial identification was of a skeletal fossil belonging to a giant some tens of millions of years or a hundred million years ago.
Three
There was a sound.
"The fossils" "The mouths are shaking."
Zhao doesn't know much about fossils, but it's a little bit... a little bit!
"Is it a dinosaur? Is it a legendary prehistoric beast?"
When he was a child he loved the story of dinosaurs! even dreamed of being a dinosaur hunter!
"It's not necessarily a dinosaur, it's probably some kind of ocean crawler," he said.
To me it was a dinosaur whatever the specific definition of a dinosaur, terrestrial, marine, in his eyes, the kind of creatures of that period were dinosaurs!
Zheng also asked for more photos of skeletal fossils, "This bone is so big! buried under the ground must be a big guy! boss you can't dig alone now I'll help you!
There was a little silence on the side of the south wind, but after a while the left Yu and Yan Biang calmed down a little and heard the south wind speak.
boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss
The last half of the sentences have been broken, and you can see how excited the south wind is at this time.
Privately Traded Islands have been searched for a long time, but the early searches were mainly to find out whether there were any energy minerals, or whether there were any kinds of century-old viruses and hazards, as were the islands purchased by the buyers.
Don't worry about energy minerals, some of which have been dug up, and even islands may have become one of the untraded.
As a result, the islands without energy minerals have become commodities for merchants to buy and sell, including on the islands.
Fossils for the new century archaeology, collection, ancient biology research, etc., it is a big event, so many years down, if the number of fossils excavated is really too small, will not be gradually ignored.
In fact, there are countless fossils of ancient organisms, such as some insects, plants, etc., that can be excavated even after centuries of extinction, but people still love dinosaurs, only dinosaurs are too few.
However, who could have imagined that under a remote island, there were fossils of ancient life millions of years ago?
Fossil!
It's a real fossil!
Contrary to the excitement of the three south winds, the side summoned calmly arranged fossil mining related matters.
Find a professional team to dig fossils.
As a result, the summoned to take photographs of the excavated bones, as well as a video of the excavation, released on a social network, and said that he was looking for a professional team to work with.
After it was sent out, the call's personal terminal didn't stop ringing.
The researchers always have a way to get his communications number. The major media also come directly to inquire.
This day, many were shocked by the headlines that were sent in real time.
"The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils"
"Look at these bones that have been dug out are big enough, and the rest have not been dug out, it's a big guy!"
"Are you calling again? "This is a very different figure.
Did his dog dig?I doubt my dog yesterday gave me a bone with earthy taste, and a fossil!But I threw the bone in the garbage collector--I felt lost billions!
It's a big event in the new century, and it's been known all over the world.
On a nearby small island, his dog, right, the one with the price of about 300 million, dug out the bones of dinosaurs tens of millions of years ago.
This news is too much, and at the same time it is directly pulling the flow of several circles.
At the same time, more professional excavation teams are flying to the small islands called for.
CHAPTER 460
The discovery of dinosaurs on the island prompted many of the islanders who had intended to sell the seals to withdraw from the sale and contact the professional search teams to check the bottom of their islands and nearby islands.
No, at least contact three different teams check more than three times they can rest assured!
Come on! Let's see if there's any fossils on the island I bought!
At one time, many have been ignored by the almost disbanded professional rock exploration team, are alive again!
It's a pity that's where the senior research team is now, and they don't know if there's any other island, but there's definitely one, and it's a big guy!
As a result, anxious islanders were only able to find a geological survey team or other non-scientific teams, and some of those who had already fled to call the small island for a temporary change of course, thinking of first going to the employer's island to find out if there were any fossils.
The saddest thing is the former owner of the island sold to the party.
How many disadvantages of his own little island he is well aware of, is far from the ground, is difficult to manage, wants to reform is certainly costly, and in terms of market markets can not quickly commercialize, how happy to sell out, throw out a problem.
But how long does this sell?
Has it been half a month?
Looking at the news in front of him, the former owner almost bleed out, repenting and resentful, depressed face twisted.
Nevertheless, business is so, who is a winner is really bad to say, yesterday he thought he was a big winner, today to find himself losing face, look at the jokes now on the Internet who sold the island to the caller!
Thinking of the fossils buried beneath, the former island lord was dripping blood.
Oh! Oh!
He should have explored the island again!
Call!
It's dangerous!
It's too dangerous!
He didn't believe it when he didn't get the news!
I must know there are dinosaurs under that island so I'm hurrying to buy!
Yes, every action is purpose! Every action is worth studying, you can't even guess what he'll do next!
Because there are so many fields that the call for news is so widespread that the people around the world who are not so interested in the news know that.
Moran thought the party would prepare for the performance on the remote island, but did not think it was the last few days, the wind wave again!
Don't worry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Of course,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reassment of the anxious Molong, when the conversation was finished, the summoner saw the coat come this way.
Therm ran before therm, lifted his tail, and approached therm almost in the presence of the sun.
"It's a nice new ring," said therapist.
"I'll go and dig the bones next time! "
"Do you like digging bones?" he asked.
"I like it," said therap without hesitation.
There's a game! Look at it this time it's got a game and a terminal, what a good thing!
What do you think?
He changed his mind. He was going to use fossils to feed his dogs, but now he can control his change and he can go to the sea for food.
And this fossil event is estimated to earn a dog food money, not need to hurry to sell the fossil.
Later, he picked up the bones, or some other stuff, and he helped to get the hair.
Isn't it said in the old warrior's book, "Be careful with every gift they give you," which seems to make sense.
Or you can go directly to a private collection, and collect all the stuff that comes back.
The more you think about it, the better.
Cutting bones is better than playing games at home all day.
There's a lot of strangers on the island, and the summons have told him, that he doesn't worry, that he can now control the interference, that he doesn't suddenly turn into a freak, that he doesn't worry about being exposed anymore.
However, there are more outsiders come to their own dining area,卷毛 decide to visit more dining area, both under and under water!
"Is this terminal waterproof?" he asked, worried.
"It's about two hundred meters waterproof, and it's pretty safe down there," he said.
"Two hundred meters" ""Two hundred meters? """""It's okay to be careful not to wear a terminal when you go in the water.""
Hearing the sound of the airplane landing, he rolled his hair over, and then spread his dog's legs to run over.
It's the three of the south.
The Three Winds, after receiving the call, came by horse, and when they had not yet fallen, they found that part of the island, toward the southeast, was full of holes.
But it doesn't matter!
They don't have any pain!
As soon as he came down from the aircraft, the south wind saw the cape run before them.
He looked up at the end of his neck.
Thermal Winds would have noticed, but now he had a dinosaur screen in his mind, and hadn't noticed the subtle emotions of the hair.
Now the South looks like a golden chicken with golden eggs.
"Look at our little rolls, you know you've done a great thing," said the southerly wind.
The dark dog's eyes looked at him.
Hearing the south wind,'Your master's going to come out this time, that's a dinosaur!
It's a big one. tens of millions of years ago, like a little dog like you, ten is not enough for it to tear!
Curl looked at them again and turned away.
South Wind is not enough now, he first summoned to know the situation, then with Zheng Biang and Le Yu hand to dig out two skeletons, excitedly open the camera a big shot, in the neighbourhood and social platform a round.
As soon as there were others to come, the three did not have so much leisure, dug the fossils, took photographs and finished the forcing, and went to work each other.
It is very likely that was the first complete and more than 20 meters of prehistoric animal fossils for five hundred years of the new century.
However, the islands are private property, including a circle near the island, all of which belong to private territories, and are not allowed to enter without permission of the owners, and the summons can be fired directly.
Southern Wind is responsible for communicating with these teams.
Thes also hired some to maintain order on and around the island, and the Yanzhou Navy said they would send a team to help.
There were too many people from all over the world, and the Yanzhou Navy had to pay attention.
Even if it wasn't a summon, they would have to deal with the masters.
It's very good.
Following the dispatch of the finding of a partner, a professional research team from the continents initiated a request to participate in the excavation, without being paid, provided the dispatch allowed them to participate in the excavation.
There are even people who are fighting for their titles.
In addition to these teams, the media of all sides will not lag behind, Yanzhou TV has also contracted the side to interview.
The originally cool island became extraordinary, some simple temporary housing built up.
Even the sea near the small islands are very small ships, and are increasing.
They can't log onto the island, they'll stay on the ship!
Anyone who wants to see what's going on is packed in a boat and is not allowed to enter the area of private islands.
There are a lot of private aircraft, which are not allowed to fly into private areas, which are only around, and there are people on top with telescopes to watch.
This excavation was very memorable and the teams competed intensely.
Out of these teams were selected from twelve continents, most of which were based on research.
Such a big project wasted, the teams were not so happy, but the call means they also understand, if anyone is not happy, they can leave.
There are a lot of private groups who are not allowed to enter the island. They wait for which group to go, and they crowd in.
Therefore, even if they were not willing to share with others, the twelve teams still agreed, and no one would want to give up this opportunity, and now can only cooperate.
Well, he didn't point at his hands or his feet, and he said that he had to give something to a professional to make him feel better.
This time also saw the world's first family Brian family, the other one offered to come and find him.
The Bryan family, which made an enormous contribution to the end of the century, now owns the largest private museum in the kingdom, the Bryan Museum.
The Bronze Museum has the world's only dragonhead, as well as a complete fossil of theft.
Besides the precious collections, the most famous of the Bryan family, are the people of their family.
The Bryan family, both men and women, are of great value, yet the people who have watched the Bryan family around the world know that it is a family that looks like shit.
Not long ago, there was one in the family who, looking for insect amber from 100 million years ago, almost turned himself into a wild man.
Theronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronron
He came to seek the hope that after digging out the dinosaurs below, he could hire them for two months each year, and the Bryan Museum and the Queen's Museum each exhibit for one month.
Buying directly is a good thing, they don't mind spending more money, but the caller clearly said not to sell when they just came.
Therefore, you can only go back and ask for the second, do not buy and rent.
Now the summons do not want to say these: dig out and talk.
He'll have to see how these teams perform before he decides.
There are differences between museums in terms of their ability to manage and their importance to their collections.
Director Brian did not expect the summons to agree now, he only hoped that after the fossils were excavated, the summons could give priority to them if they were looking for partners, but with the greatest sincerity!
There were five of Brian's family who followed the director, both men and women, and they did a lot of digging.
The sweat washed out, the dust was flying, and the face was so muddy that it could not be seen, except the two hot eyes.
They don't care about the cameras they're shooting, and they don't care if they show up to the world's audience, because their family's way of doing things is well known.
What a face is important fossil!
After the division of several professional teams work more efficiently.
They were busy digging out fossils, and they were already blocked by reporters.
Regionally Advantaged Reporter of Enzhou Television first came to interview the side.
"How did you first find the fossil? Did your dog really find it?" the reporter asked, laughing at the dog who had been squatting next to him.
"Yes, the first bone was dug."
The camera is facing the curl next to the call.
Pull the dog's head up slightly, exposing the necklace on the neck, and the end with the little dog's tattoo, not let a dog's hair cover it.
Over there, the camera, after taking a moment of the dog, calls again to the side.
The reporter asked some of the most curious questions, such as why the hair can find fossils underground.
"We just bought the island, reconstruction, because of the construction, exposed the bottom rock layer, but no one notices, is the hair cut out the bone," the call said.
Several Southwind interviewers commented:
In order to weaken the ability of the ear, the boss pushed all this to the hair?
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No!
Asked why he would buy the island, he said he only wanted to find a quiet place where he could find the fossils were really luck.
Lucky?
Most people don't believe.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Does his ear need to be covered now?
Regardless of what the reporter said, on the face was a "it was" look, according to the speech exaggerated the cleverly squat next to the summons.
Well, I'm very excited.
When the interview is finished, run to visit the site, wait for the interview to be broadcast, and keep in front of the TV.
As a local television station, the news is more serious, broadcast interviews are also called originals, have not done any distortion or blur editing.
And thermal shots also have a few seconds, Now even the little news is in a high-definition environment, the official television news screen, sufficient to make the dog clear.
The terminal there, probably in order to avoid suspicion of advertising, was blocked by the television.
Always keep the hair in front of the TV
Chapter 461
Their new rings failed and the whole dog fell down.
When they came back, they saw what the southerly wind was saying to them, but they were just slowing down with their heads.
When he saw the summon, the south wind hurried to say the abnormal of the hair.
" boss," said he, "are you having a bad stomach? Or are there too many strangers on the island who aren't adapting? Are you sick?
Their call took the rope, indicating that the south wind was going to work first, and this side he was going to deal with.
By dragging the hair back into the house, the summon can roughly guess the cause of the hair.
owowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowow
When you do something, you don't think about anything else.
He lifted his head to look at him.
A large warehouse has been built on the southeast side of the island, and all the bones that have been dug are in it.
Buried under the island, prehistoric organisms are too large to minimize the damage to the fossils, and excavation is difficult, although twelve teams are responsible for excavating, but one day or two is not complete.
A large temporary warehouse was built southeast of the island, in which, apart from depositing fossils, the team's tools and supplies were stored, as well as a temporary restroom.
Although the security system has been installed, the summons more trust the capability of the hair, by the way, disperse the attention of the hair.
Recently there have been too many people on the island, and when they are on the other side of the island, they have to be carried by people, they need to put on dog ropes, and they have to be limited.
Now we're calling for free movement in the big warehouse, small, but no rope.
"If you're doing well," he said, "I'll take you out for a while," he said.
As soon as the dog's eyes light up, the moment rises.
He knew he had a time to go to the show, and he didn't necessarily follow.
It's a pleasure to say so now.
Then, as soon as the south wind had received a call, as I went back, I saw the wind blowing into the warehouse, shivering.
'Is it?' said the south wind, looking at him with suspicion.
"Keep the warehouse door."
He greeted the staff on the other side of the warehouse and put a sign on the side of the warehouse door saying: danger! do not enter!
Outgoing staff stared at the three sighs on the sign.
Danger?
What's the danger?
It's so strong, is it?
They've been working here for two days. why don't they find out what's wrong with the warehouse?
There's been a lot of dogs.
Isn't the owner's dog gonna bite the bones?
"It can't be eaten on the table again.
"It's up to him," he said, "because he chose to put it in."
Even if the warehouse staff are unwilling to see a pet dog in this place, who is to be called the island owner?
All right, you're the master, you're free.
And has entered the warehouse, also entered into the working state.
In order to bring it out to the star, check the warehouse very seriously.
Walked around the warehouse, every little corner looked at, not even a bug left.
At the end of the inspection, rolled up at the door of the warehouse, looking in and out of the staff, not screaming and running, recognized seriously as a watch dog.
At this time, some distance from the small island, there was a yacht, and there were many other boats near it, which were not visible.
We've been able to sneak into the island, and we've been pretending very well! Now that we've got the technology, it's worth buying it from the black market.
"Look at the manual, which says the latest kind of simulation technology can avoid most civilian security systems.
Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good
It's also small and can carry only 20 kg.
"If I'm not greed, I'll have a small bone, and if I don't have one or two smaller bones, I'll surely not find them."
I'm not greedy. I'm satisfied with just one bone.
We'll share the money we've sold!
"The warehouse has guards. "I'm much more careful.
"Don't worry," he said, "I've got a solvent anesthesia, enough to put down an elephant, which I can't find."
"The summons are too hasty, and when they dig into the fossils, they are unprepared, and all these are islands of the sea, and there are so many, and there are not enough guards.
Furthermore, the party believes too much in the so-called smart security system, or too young to know the speed at which electronic devices are being replaced.
Wait for the night?
Well, it's more convenient at night.
The sun is falling, the night is getting dark.
After a busy day of digging, they returned to their home, and simply finished and rested.
On the first day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, by the evening, too tight time to nourish sharp.
Within two days, according to the current progress, the giant buried under the island will be fully excavated, and they will soon be able to see the skeleton of the million-year-old prehistoric giant!
The miners went into their dreams with smiles, and did not know, in the darkness, there were many foolish shadows.
At night the small island is more quiet, at night the active insects come out.
A small reptile crawled out of the grass toward the warehouse.
On the beach outside the small island, in a search boat, several people stared at the monitor screen.
It's been taken from a crawler's point of view, and it's already close to the warehouse, and it's going to drill through the window the next minute.
Several people stared at the warehouse, and when they hadn't come to be happy, they heard a whisper of "H" and cut off the connection.
What's the matter?
It's been found.
Has the current civil security system been upgraded?
Shouldn't the next generation of simulation technology just come out and upgrade? Not so fast before.
"The security system of the warehouse is arranged with the bodyguard of a security company, say uncertainly arranged is the military equipment?"
A Silence.
But most of them are home!
On the other side of the island, there are many vessels that do not appear to be visible, and similar things happen.
Their high-price items, which are said to have been made using new technologies, such as micros detectors, spying tools, smart thefts, were sold out without returning, and each of them had just entered the warehouse, and some seemed to have been knocked down, and some had just disappeared.
Whether it's fly or it's climb or it's drill, it's all a result.
Don't say stealing bones, even cutting can't succeed!
They're also quietly asking which company is helping this side of security.
But they don't believe what they hear.
It must be the surface of the mischief!
It's too dangerous!
Indeed, the stronger the mystery, the summons must hide the bottom card!
Is Mo calling for the military help?
In the new warehouse on the southeast of the island, therm carefully took a gravely deformed reptile and placed it in a corner box.
Fifth!
Together twenty can change one game chance!
CHAPTER 462 Top predator
The security system on the side of the warehouse is controlled by the left Yu and Zheng Biang, the rowing guards, the behavior of the rubber of course is also under their supervision.
Wool knows there are cameras in the warehouse, and it knows that this is another test for it.
In order to prevent the bad habit to see what to eat, the party really did a lot of effort, this time also to test the the good of the hair.
It can swallow it can swallow, it can not even be detected by the monitor, or catch a few swallow a few play, but catch twenty can change a game, of course it can not swallow one, every put a number one, afraid of anybody moving its box.
It's amazing that's the watch tonight.
"It's a good dog to do the work! "
He's actually noticed a lot of bugs in the warehouse tonight, and it's clear that he's done some insecticide.
But looking at the one caught in the box prepared for the summons, one of which was also emitted by the lightning when the the therm trembled, Ying Biao knew that was wrong, the horse contact the summons.
He said that side of the warehouse was personally guarded by Yan Biang and Le Yu, not in exchange for the others, nor let the others near the control room, could ask for a pass directly to the command, by the south wind branch or the command himself to guard.
If there are abnormal events on the side of the warehouse, it must be notified to the party at the earliest, not to leak any information outside.
Zhao and Zhao only regarded the fossils, and did not feel that the order was wrong.
However, after the first time said this side of the exceptions to the summons, the summons only let him watch the monitoring and do not have to take care of the things the hair caught.
Yan also asked some veteran friends to learn some information.
Recently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't realize that security system is not working.
Not one of those reproduction devices has been able to get close to the dinosaurs!
Looking at the hair cut into the box a seemingly uncommon weed in the gap, Yi sighed, thinking: We have to upgrade the security system tomorrow.
Doesn't everything depend on the hair, does he go all the way to the bottom of the salmon?
Over the next two days, there were all kinds of things trying to sneak into the warehouse, that looked like insects, and that looked like plants.
However, bones sent to the warehouse, none could be stolen, and under the roots of nothing sneaky flow out.
There were those who tried to buy in staff, but the team they chose were old guys, and they were strictly managed within the team, and even if they were, they wouldn't wait for the team to kick out.
When they called for a contract, it was written that if there was a problem within one team, the entire team would be responsible, not only for being excluded from the project, but also for paying a large amount of default.
That's why they're more proactive than they were when they found a problem.
At noon that day, a miner was sick and the team's professor took him to the restroom of the warehouse to rest.
The worker, with the box just entered the warehouse, was stopped by a roll of hair.
W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W
The warehouse guard surrounded.
All the other workers looked over there.
The man who was stopped, carrying the box, was frightened. He did not do wrong, but was frightened.
The guarded him aside, and opened the box that had been staring at.
The hair washed out the tools in the eye box, the dog claws on a geological hammer.
The man who was stopped suddenly looked like this: This is not my hammer! My hammer bears my own name! There is nothing on this earth hammer!
Then he hurriedly contacted the team professor, Teacher! My box has been moved!
In order to keep his students and keep his team involved in the mining project, the team professor reacted quickly and also cooperated with the investigation.
And they have their own way of dealing.
Soon, the members of the team proved themselves innocent, and helped to catch three suspects.
What happened to this team also got the other mining team ready, except for themselves, no one can touch their own toolbox!
Their clothes are checked every day, and every person who tries to get close to them is a hundred thousand times more vigilant.
They weren't supposed to be interviewed by mainstream media, and now they are being blocked by mainstream media every day.
If nothing had happened to the box, they would have been floating, but today's thing is to give them a bowl of ice water to cool down.
It's already the last stage of excavation, looking at skeletal fossils are all out of the ground, at this time to be out of the project, absolutely is a great regret of life!
Can't fall at this critical moment!
Soon, the others on the island found that the excavation team used to laugh at the work, now, the atmosphere is quite serious.
Besides, no matter how busy, there will always be a player responsible for staring around.
With the work of twelve teams, the bones that were buried on the island were finally excavated.
Bones are relatively intact, and there are few places where they need to be replaced.
After simulating the skeleton recovery, they mounted the skeleton fossils.
At the moment the scaffold was finished, they looked up at the concrete scaffold, nearly fifty meters long, as if through time and space, they saw the sea lord seventy million years ago.
A young staffer next to me has spoken.
Several of the old professors who commanded the skeleton scaffolds were also tears.
I didn't think I could see the top predators of the ocean 70 million years ago!
After an hour of uninterrupted discussions surrounding the enormous skeleton, they had to face a problem.
"It has to have a name," said one of the team professors.
When they searched for a lot of information, they couldn't find the corresponding, and there was no doubt that they had dug out an unknown species, so they had to take a name.
But now the problem is this time not a single team found, but several teams excavated, the skeleton or the owner of the island.
According to the rules?
"Do we have the right to name?
"What's your name? Oh, your name, Lord of the Islands!"
"It's up to you to decide," said the commander.
Their professors thought about how they might be advised if they chose to name themselves, but they did not think that they had been given the right to name themselves.
In the ancient times, in many places, these fossils of scientific value of the ancient vertebrate all belong to the state.
Although the new century's cultural heritage management laws are different, the party's call to these actually has nothing to worry about.
If it's not because of hair, the summons will even donate the skeleton directly to one or several museums.
Their eyes looked at their hair, which was guarded by a box filled with crawlers.
Besides playing and eating, the dog is really not interested in anything.
When the audience called for their naming rights, an old professor was shaking with excitement, and the assistant for the blind was about to fill the old man's house with two tablets.
The names of the twelve excavation teams were discussed at length.
Finally, they gave this prehistoric top predator, named Sea Dragon.
It's the largest skeletal fossil ever found, and it's obvious that tooth eats meat, and that's true of the top predators in the ocean at that time.
It's after.
The Twelve Teams once again entered into a fierce debate.
Certainly, the newly discovered sea lion should belong to the marine reptiles, theoretically not to dinosaurs.
But mainstream folk cultures are accustomed to living in that period so characteristic creatures, called dinosaurs.
However, in the new century, many ancient biologists proposed re-establishing the classification.
There is a large gap in the new century in the study of ancient organisms, and the limited information left over from the old century, they are only as a reference, not completely believed.
They only believe in their own research.
After the drawing, ancient biology professor holds the hand: "I see you have a connection with dinosaurs, are you interested in ancient biology research?
Call:...
No.
Their purpose was to find the bones of the sea dragon.
Two days later, online platforms with news about "the sea dragon" almost cradled their displays.
No archaeology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The large crowds also have a shocking and reassuring psychology, the Internet is a blast, all kinds of stories fill the brain to fly up, as if they had seen it before.
"These'sea masters' who were discovered before now look like little brothers.
No! Real No!
Sea Lord level predator! Look forward to a sea dragon movie!
"I don't know if the shark's skeleton will be shown publicly in the future?"
"The skeleton is too expensive to be disclosed."
Models too. When are the models of the sea dragon?
"It's going to depend on how you decide.
"I declare that is the only one who can step on the head of the Prince of the Sea!"
Uh?
"Well, that's true too.
It is true that is the tomb of the king of the sea, and it is written that it is sick to step on it.
Soon a new topic emerged.
♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
South looked at the sudden rise of hot topics on the network social platform, a "Ha ha ha".
Because of the bones of the dragon, not to mention, just to pay the rent to get a good deal.
Boss, you're really good this time! You sell the bones and you're back in the billion club!
"I'm not going to sell," said the party.
After astonishment, the southerly wind, with a look of ecstasy, said, Yes! Like this precious world, the only thing to be kept in hand is to cover for two years!
"I'm going to open a collection," he said. "I'm going to have a collection," he said.
After being surprised again by the south wind, it came back to the mind, it is worth the boss, it is long to think.
Don't sell the skeleton for a while, run the museum itself, and also make money using the surrounding products!
Neptune is the largest living thing that has ever been on our planet, and there may be more living things on our planet, but for ancient researchers don't know where the energy is.
Moreover, people's feelings about the planet are irreplaceable, here is the history of human development, the history of all.
There is a tendency.
Besides these, according to today's policies and management, the planet's alien life is restricted strictly, on the value of the collection, absolutely and on the planet's head, there is no alternative.
The South Wind was satisfied with the idea of the summon.
The boss still has an investment.
"It's a top predator in the ocean, and no matter what looks powerful enough, it's already extinct," said Southwind, looking at the characteristics of all the possible sea emperors simulated by the research team.
I don't know what the top predators in the universe look like.
The south wind began to dream, " must be quite powerful.
"It's not necessarily," he said, "some creatures look cute, but they are deadly."
Southern Wind: Ha! Boss You are funny!
One day you will understand.
There was a sense of identity on the face of the south wind, and in the heart again a "Ha ha ha ha".
You're the boss You're all right, even if you say the hair is the top predator I'll hold my hands!
Chapter 463 There is no better than a dog
Widespread coverage of the giant, a large number of ancient biological research papers have been published, and many of the previously filmed documentaries that considered impossible have been overturned.
A student who studies ancient vertebrates laughed when he was interviewed by the media: "As our former teachers said, documentaries and archaeological excavations are always faced with the continuation of information.
The discovery of the dragon is a significant event for us, and we believe that in many places we do not know, there are more surprises waiting to be found.
Their mission was to dig out the dragon of the sea, to bring the attention of the people from the land to the islands and the oceans, where in the rare places, there must have been more than tens of millions of years of life, and fortunately to have escaped the disaster of the century.
The Islands!
Although not so high, there were more people willing to buy the islands than before, and the island prices quickly stopped falling and rose.
There is even ancient biology enthusiast who specially bought an island to set up his own research base and set up a new team to explore the underwater rocks.
Following the landing of the Sea Dragon, the team signed a cooperation agreement with the Bryan Museum and the Museum of the Sea, and the next two months the Sea Dragon would be shipped to the Museum of the Sea, and exhibited at the two museums respectively.
As for the Enzhou Museum...the director was so weary that he cried.
There's no way.they have a geographical advantage. After all, it's the locals.
However, on the strength, they are not temporarily able to bear all the pressures brought by the sea dragon.
However, there are two months of buffer time, they must be ready to meet the sea dragon!
Where else to put the face!
After the dragon moved out, all the attention was shifted, and the little island was quiet again. +
Their plan was to build a collection, but the small island was not a good place, and he did not know when to go out, and when someone came to do something on the island, he did not take care, and when he came back, all the things he had dug were stolen.
There was nowhere to look at a time, and at the same time there was not enough money in my hands, I could only wait to save enough money and do it again.
Sea Dragon has rented out, and there are merchants looking for him to work with. However, the focus of the party is on the forthcoming star show.
He received an invitation from the organizer.
At this point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hidden.
Top Three Outer Spaces!
Others, too little information, even military newspapers rarely report on the underworld.
However, hidden stars are recognized as having the highest scientific power.
Here are some of the things you need to be careful about. In more detail, I'll send you an electronic document, which will set out the itinerary and will be notified by a specialist.
"Can you bring a dog?" asked the party.
There was a little fluctuation in the voice that could not be heard: "You're saying curls? They can carry, and the other dogs can't.
Of course if you don't have time to feed your dog, we can help, by the way, so that it can communicate with our airport seizure team.
It doesn't come as a surprise that person knows the hair.
It's been a real success, and it's been a real success, since the airport seizure departments want to take the dog away.
Therm Star's airport did have the idea, but after knowing the summons would not let the dog out, it didn't make any noise.
Of course, they're also interested in the other's ears, except that the other's ears are too focused on the musical art, and it's harder to dig.
After talking to the host on the other side of the galaxy, the party received an electronic document containing the application guidelines for accompanying personnel and accompanying pets.
He told the three south winds, but did not tell them where the hidden star was.
All three said they would follow.
With his sharp insight, the south winds guessed that the place to which the party was summoned would be very high, so that he would not be left!
Hearing that would be the case, the southerly wind was worried: Isn't that the place where you are going will be strictly controlled and dogs will be able to carry it?
Although I don't know where to go this time, this is a complicated and strict place to look and allow to take pet dogs?
"I'll give you a link," he said without much explanation. "You just need to help me with the paper.
"I understand, boss!"
Southern Winds quickly called on Yi and Le Yu to submit accompanying applications together.
Their accompanying personnel face much more rigorous audits, the first of which is to face the political trials.
Misspeaking in public or files are likely to be punished.
"A pet has to be put on trial too?" Nanfeng was surprised, but he also filed an application for a roll.
One minute later, the ballot was passed.
The South
Is Pet Audit Now So Fast?
An Hour later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The South
The south wind didn't come to tell me when to have dinner.
"Why are you passing so fast? "Well, I...I...I wouldn't have done that," said the south wind, with a pale face and trembling.
"It's probably because you've been in the entertainment business for a long time, it's better to be strict," he said.
Southern winds still high, he is in the entertainment circle, or downstairs staff, talk may be more casual, do things may not be quite sophisticated, but what is not to say he must not have said, or done anything good!
The South Wind hasn't slept tonight.
Well, the next day received the message passed, the long-standing heart was to rest.
OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK
The following rounds of inspection went smoothly, but the last one required them to go to the designated site for physical inspection within seven working days.
They're coming together.
Boss, aren't you done? You don't have to go, I can handle these, said Southwind.
Physical examination is simple!
"I'll go and see," said the party.
Once at the designated place, three dogs enter different test channels.
Then he took a long chair and sat down to read.
Half an hour later, the hair of the little dog's claws came out, gently relaxed, without pressure.
Two hours later, Yan-be came out of the inspection channel.
There were no left or south winds, and Ying Biang was still a bit proud.
Look, he's still the strongest, White and Star served for many years, still has an advantage!
As for thermal hair, Yi is not the right thing.
He thinks the testing of pets on this side certainly broadened the standard.
Their hair wasted.
When Liu came out, the fold again, looking for a comfortable position to continue to lie down.
By the time the south wind came out of the detection channel, the cape had fallen to sleep by the side of the foot.
The south wind from the detection channel is still some dizziness, some vomiting.
"It's a tough test," he said.
It can be seen from the inside of the body test, this is definitely not a more comfortable place to perform.
Liu laughed next to: "I said south wind, you used to be white and star, no, step back step back! Start to exercise tomorrow!"
Zheng also agreed: "It is to strengthen training, you say, even dogs are better than, it is good?"
The South looked at Yan and Le Yu, already sitting in a long chair, and looked at the sleeping, snoring hair, the ecstasy.
No no no no no no no no no no no!
After many years of service, have I become a weak chicken?
Chapter 464
After the application was accepted, the party called off all subsequent invitations to cooperate, even the opening ceremony of the first public exhibition of the Sea Dragon over the Isle of Man.
Their First Show.
There was a long line outside the museum, and the people who were attracted by the sea dragon, each excited and red, even the slow line inspection endured.
There are also some dinosaur related model toys, etc., the queue people can not wait before brushing some toys to play.
When the invited media reporters entered the hall through the journalist channel, then a shot to the sea dragon.
Not all of them were allowed to land on the small islands, so no photographs were taken before this, and they were mostly transmitted to other families.
Their smiles stopped at the opening ceremony, when the two directors returned to their offices after receiving the reporters.
The Director of the Museum of the Queen looked at the several cloned mechanical reptiles on the table, look very bad.
Director Brian also celebrated: "If we were not reminded of the special upgrade, there would be a lot of losses this time."
As they handed over the remains of the dragon, the summons reminded them of the need for an upgrade to the security of the simulated mechanical technology.
The two directors greatly appreciated the first exhibition of the Sea Dragon. Of course, the recommendation of the invited party is to make special upgrades to the own museum when the Sea Dragon has not been transferred.
At the same time as the two directors were angry and celebrating, there was also a group of people who hit the emperor's idea, and jumped their feet.
"What does it mean that the requisitioned warehouses are not allowed to enter, and that he may have used some of the military equipment over there, but neither the Imperial nor the Bryan Museum are allowed to enter?"
This technology is out of date!
"I spent so much money on something out of date!"
"The seller deceived me!"
What is the latest type of simulation machine, all TM is a pit!
That's all I've spent!
Technology is not worth it, black thing, expensive, but never so pity!
A man who thinks he has been thoroughly buried, finds a seller to pay back, fails to find a man, and in anger throws a lot of money to kill the original seller, and reminds the later: "The black market has more water!"
Within T, the people who were ordered to sell the biotechnology, were furious and fled.
After discovering theft of biotechnology against the ineffectiveness of the Yanzhou Sea defense, T organization people thought to create more money with biotechnology, just encountered the big news of the call to dig out fossils, they seized the opportunity to make a set of biotechnology machines, after making a big profit on the black market!
However, shortly afterwards, the people who purchased the simulated machinery shouted back.
This convinces T's people that simulation technology is a conspiracy against their organization!
Even the military, the Navy is not able to recognize them, but the civil security system is also upgraded to the version of the anti-reproduction technology, they spend so much energy to actually steal only an outdated technology!
To create all the summons, this time indirectly stabbed T organization a knife.
Knowing that little island had anthropomorphic reptiles, the summons reported that, after the Queen's Museum and the Bryan Museum, more important places would be upgraded to anthropomorphic technology.
However, there is no time to focus on security upgrades, he is now packing up, ready to go to the underworld.
The time to leave will be a little longer, the party called to the old man and the old woman said.
No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Boss, 80 million... let the rabbit go home, said the south wind.
"Well," he said,looking at the glass, he put the rabbit in the house by the seaside, not on the small island, where if anything happened, the property would be able to respond quickly.
"Okay," said thermal wind, which was still a little uncomfortable, and continued to report on the work. "The construction team on the island has progressed well, and will be recovered when we come back.
Now, because of the remains of the sea dragon, which were dug and built and demolished on the island, the people were asked to restore, to dig the great pits of the remains, and to repair and rebuild the rest of the island.
After they had their things sorted out, they got a phone call, which was sent from the military area to their people.
The plane stopped at the landing.
Two soldiers came to verify the identity.
Call,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The soldier who discovered nuclear identity had his eyes on the roll for a while, as if he had confirmed once more that this was not the dog in the application form.
Once the four had their identity checked and had their luggage checked, the two soldiers did not have much to say, and took them onto the airplane to the Yanzhou Military Area.
The Mission will be flying together with the other invited personnel in the Yanzhou Military Area to meet at the Foreign Airport.
The three of the south, one of the special forces, and two of the outer stars of the army, at this time, with their jaws straightened and their steely faces, faced with the men of the Yanzhou army, at this time, they could not be called to the face.
However, after boarding the aircraft, the sight of the two soldiers only passed the three, and then concentrated mainly on the summons and the hair.
The two soldiers were instructed by the Multiple Career to call with his dog, and as for the three South Winds, they were not under their care, as long as they were verified correctly.
Actually, they weren't sent on this trip, they were just carrying out their duties, and they were sent to the place where they were staying recently.
There was also a box of energy minerals and some of the goods, which were to be transported to the other side of the military area.
It lay quietly on the side of the caller, and the two creeping dogs wiped their eyes, licked their noses, and lifted their eyes to the caller, and hummed.
He glanced at her, and reached for her dog.
The hair fell back safely, but a second licked licked nose, licked mouth.
A soldier asked,Is he thirsty?
"It's thirsty," said the South, "and bring it out of the bowl of water."
"Oh! "The south wind rolled out the dog bowl and handed it over.
Yan, looking at the scene, said in his mind: Oh, pet dog is cute.
He took a bowl of the soldier's water, and after thanking the soldier, he dropped half of the bowl of water in front of the cape, and pointed his finger at the cape's head to warn.
After the cutting of the hair can complete the deformation, the diet expanded, the amount of food also expanded, yesterday also put it out to look for food.
Thirst?
No,it's just a mouthful.
Of course,the facts will not be said.cannot be said.
What else can I say?
Says thermal cabin is thermal cabin?
There's some sadness.
It seems that dog must be brought by himself, or he will not be relieved, this time out to watch closely, one not paying attention, he said uncertainly can run to eat something strange, even leaves.
CHAPTER 465 Nobody wants to steal a dog
Several reporters were preparing to interview a armored division that had just returned from the mission.
Isn't that's called?
A few others looked past.
It looks like it!
From the dog who followed him, there is no mistake!
"What is he doing in Yanzhou?"
"I just found they were coming up from a military aircraft, and two soldiers were escorting them.
Interesting, what's he doing this time?
A young journalist is about to take a few photos and is stopped by others.
The young reporter calmed down and regretted the impulse.
Get inside the military area. Unless it's an arranged activity, don't shoot.
So, even if the curiosity is to die, still have to control, otherwise they will be driven out directly, career will end there.
But if they don't take pictures, they're going to gossip about it in private.
"I think it's going to happen again.
There's been news about him around the world recently, and I thought he'd been busy with the sea dragon fossils, and I didn't expect to see him here.
"I don't think I've seen any of his moves in the last few days," he said. "It's all about fossils and no trace of him."
"I listened to my friend say a lot of fun looking at him, but I didn't find anyone.
Now it's backwards, I think when I was young, the speed of the party was so painful that they were able to dig a hand out of the news we had not yet reported.
Indeed, as some of these journalists have said, because of the enthusiasm raised by the sea dragon, everyone will naturally turn to the attention of the side.
But what's different this time is that a lot of investors are also watching.
They analyzed the dragon's excavation process, thinking that the summons must have received the message in advance, then so rushed to buy the small island.
After analyzing the way of the summon, I always feel that this person every time he goes out, he will do big things.
Sea Dragon Fossil Event is definitely not the end!
This time they stared at the summoner, especially at his movements, and wondered if he had been sneaking away from the fossils, or if he had found something of value.
However.
Play Lost!
Call, including his assistant and his bodyguard, and the dog that can dig the fossils, are all gone!
Even the first exhibition ceremony is definitely something more important!
But he hasn't heard of anything recently.
Look!
What's going on the little boy?
Isn't that's going to happen again?!
However, wait,there is no news.
Don't talk about getting stuck with investors, watching the crowds on the web, looking at the progress, too.
Their last appearance before the public was in Yan, Yan Yan's netizens began to work out.
In accordance with practice.
"The king lay down this waste!"
"The king! Come out and do the work!"
"You see, we've got a campaign," said Wang, "and we've just got over a million people involved," he said, "and we'll have over a billion by tomorrow," he said, "as long as you can find out what's going on, the money is all yours!
So, thermal surge of crowd raising, put the king over the topic list.
Wang: I thank you family!
As the crowded up on the Internet, the party had transferred from the Yanzhou Military District to the Foreign Office Airport.
They'll have to stay two days at the airport, and then they'll have to go to the underworld.
Thea Airport invited other artists invited to the underworld, and also met an old friend.
Originally involved in the filming of Genesis, the anti-professional and show-the- wife of the madman, Jonathan, and his wife, Wensha, were invited to appear in the Invisible, this time accompanied by his family to the Invisible.
Joe was very happy to see the man, and he said he would wait for the man to get his luggage and speak to him.
The south wind came and said, Boss, I have seen the next artist invited, and you are the youngest of the group.
It's also the least.
Even though the word was not finished, the party understood the meaning of the south wind.
I'm not sure I'm going to get hurt.
But all these parties are ready.
As a middle-aged artist passed by them, the eye washed over the roll of hair lying on the side of the caller's feet, his eyes frowned, and he looked at the caller again, trying to say something, he opened his mouth, and finally, with a hum, he rushed away.
Standing ready to say hello to the other
The unknown artist washed away, and was summoned to know him, David Hull, one of the world's three greatest violin masters, and the benefactor of the flamboyant "Fefe" Fee Hamernick.
Recently Fee Hamernick seems to be fighting off Sallo again, online.
However, the Confederacy recently did not pay attention to their situation, and did not know how to combat.
Unlike Fi Hamernick, who usually appears in the entertainment news, this teacher has to be much lower, and rarely appears before the public except in concerts and lectures.
He had nothing to do with him before, and this was the last time he knew what the anger of the world's top violinist was.
As David Hurd away, the south wind came and said lowly, "The one I just met, the violin master, whose student was Fee Hamernick, who has a great sense of being in the entertainment world, and who is often compared to you by the people in the circle, and who thinks that you are not paying attention to the boss.
Ben has a bias. Now that you're going to the show with a dog, I'm sure you'll be more distressed.
There were too many of these things in the circle, and the south wind thought it had found the truth, and even if it had not been the truth, it was close to the truth.
The Order did not believe that was said by the South Wind, but did not understand how David Hur's anger came.
The question was not answered until Joe was coming to talk to him.
"DavidHell?You say him," said Jonathan, looking at the drawings and the rolls lying next to him. "He must be angry," he said, "because he didn't get the approval for his pet's application, and before I came, I heard him say, 'I can't take my dogs to a foreign show.'" He was depressed, and he saw you taking your dogs at the airport.
Jonathan is telling the story of the world-famous violinist's dog-slave, which his wife told him.
"The master is now the most beloved, and besides his violin is his dog, and in the presence of both of them, the beloved brother, Fee Hamernick. Here is his beloved dog.
Joe is going to pull out a photograph of David Hill's dog.
David Hur's dog belongs to the new century artificial breeding dog, has the old century three kinds of graceful dog and the hunter dog gene, which is marked by the "long hair", which is corrected looks really graceful.
The south wind came and looked.
"The master... seems to be in love with long hair.
Jo was laughing,Yeah, he likes to have long hair.
"Your dog is not particularly long," he said, "and he doesn't seem to be able to see the eyes, but you can rest assured that he is a good dog, that is, a little jealous of you, and you don't have to worry about it; he's not really good at it.
Joe was looking at his hair again, and he knew that dog had been in the news for a long time.
"It is," he said.
"I thought the news was lying.
Jo was looking at the hair with a rare eye.
With his mouth open, a drop of water flowed down, licking his mouth, seemed to be a bit agitated.
"Isn't it too hot in here?" Joe was asking.
Although he didn't know about dogs, he did know some common things, such as, when dogs are hot, they spit out their tongues, breathe out their mouths, spit out their mouths... No, that's not a mouth, that's a dog's sweat.
It's just that Joe is looking at room temperature and at room pressure. It's normal. It's not supposed to be.
"It's just not suitable," said the quiet.
"Yes, it's hard for dogs to adapt to the atmosphere of an airport.
It's awful to go out into space!
Joe was laughing at his own jokes.
He smiled politely, but in fact he was more than relieved.
The dog washed in the sea the day before the departure, hasn't changed much, hasn't consumed much energy, how can it be hungry?
It's awful.
There are too many energy sources at the airport, which is a great temptation for the spread of the recipe.
They even suspected that dog would have eaten the entire airport if he hadn't kept his eye on the curls.
After seeing his reaction, the summoner strengthened the constraints on his hair, and he taught to his hair in private, and his hair was converging, at least not always flowing with water, and his eyes were always looking around.
Those who were invited to perform, were sometimes invited to a meeting, could not always carry the hair around.
So he handed over to the three south winds.
He brought three people here just to watch the dog.
"You watch it."
The three south winds look quiet, "I understand! "
Don't let anyone steal your dog!
Chapter 466
Hidden Planet is a global area of military control.
In addition to a few places of concentration, large spaces are used for various product experiments and military exercises.
Their natural environment is not suitable for human existence, but because of thermal energy reserves, the first alien military base was built here.
Current top navigation technology, more than 90 out of hidden stars.
From the departure, to the departure of the hidden star, the summons and others do not see the outside, during this period also signed a confidential agreement, in general, they are invited to participate in the art exhibition, the others, do not be too curious.
Waiting for a line to come out of the aircraft has landed in the specified area of the hidden star.
Their speciality causes very little real information on the Internet about them, even if they have been invited to the art team several times, they only know part of the art-related information, the others don't know, or dare to know too much.
As the first to come to ancient stars, the others do not know, but he can be sure that ancient stars' energy reserves are very rich and rich in contents - the hairy mouth water has never stopped.
Out of the aircraft, looking up, you can see the huge protective caps hanging above.
Without protective clothing, you can only be indoor, but there is no sense of narrow crowd.
"This is where the teachers are going to live..."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This is a reception center with a dormitory, with a dining hall, with an activity area.
There are some things they should be aware of, and the confidentiality agreement has been signed, and for the next time they will only be able to listen to the arrangements, to cooperate with the bands and choirs of the Hidden Stars, etc., and to be free leisure within the bounds.
Families can stay together, but the assistant and the bodyguard are separated in another building.
"Come on," said the guide.
"Can the dog go?" asked the man.
"Yes."
summons come to the room with their card.
The interior is not big, but it is very well arranged, two rooms one room, bedroom and library, decoration is very technological, also with some art style.
Besides, there are dog bowls and dog toilets.
It's coming.
After a simple resettlement, the commanders gathered them together, held a small meeting, and explained the plans and assignments for the next few days.
Their invited team, there are musicians, dancers, actors, and book painters, and so on, they all have different specialties, and they all have different targets when they get to the underworld.
To cooperate with is a young artist group.
These artists are mostly amateurs who cannot use the standards of the professional.
"Is there a problem with calling you as the leader of the youth band?" asked the commander.
"No problem," he said.
Them's selection for the young band is the Mon masterpiece, the ten-minute "Legend", which is the ending of the historical series "The Creation of the Century".
For this reason, Molong said that the command must be a command.
This is an invitation to participate in the creation and to know more about this work than others.
It's also a test that's been called.
After the meeting, everyone went back to rest, and the afternoon was arranged to visit the exhibition.
Visit these, only those invited, most of the accompanying persons are not allowed, as family members, not to mention people like the bodyguard assistant.
So the party arranged for the three south winds to bring the dogs, not to follow them.
The exhibition here is mainly scientific products of navigation, the first to come here, is very interested in these things.
In the exhibition, the most interesting is the jumping engine.
The Break Engine brought the Space Age, which is considered to be the greatest invention of the new century.
The exhibition guide is introducing the relevant information of the jump engine.
"In front of us is a part of the first generation of jumping engines, which makes space jump possible, but the energy needed to maintain the stability of the jumping engines is far beyond everyone's imagination, and the old energy cannot support the operation of the engines, so people are looking for new energy..."
Their focuses on everything from breakthroughs to energy technology to mining.
For example, how did the fold engine come into being, how did it develop, how long did it take to develop, how long did it take to support the voyage, and so on.
But the people who come here know that's what people here say, and that's what they listen to.
If the guide doesn't say anything, he won't tell you anything.
The people ahead, from the discovery of energy minerals, to the upgrading of energy conversion technology, to the classification and mining of energy minerals, these are just the stories for the rest of the art group, maybe the laughs and the laughs are over, maybe they already know, the calls are being listened to seriously.
The jump engine can't understand deeply, the energy minerals he still wants to hear more.
The more we know, the more we feel.
It's too fast!
In the new century, the breakthrough of new energy and navigation technology is too fast, far beyond the expectations.
At the end of the century, he had many questions to the scientists concerned about the realization of space travel?
But the answer was: "Maybe on the day of human extinction, there may not be breakthroughs."
However, at the end of the century, only a hundred years after the establishment of the new century, there had been a breakthrough engine, which produced the seven old-class "dream team" space exploration of the new century.
It's probably unpredictable for all those who lived to the end of the century.
One hundred years seems long, but the call is too clear the situation of the late century.
In his eyes, a hundred years, may only be used for reconstruction.
The speed of actual development of the new century seems to be a miracle.
It's been five years since the first generation of the engine was developed.
It's a pity we can't see.
However, it is also very good to see part of the first-generation jump engine.
My heart is filled with joy.
Nobody knows how he feels about the artists who are invited to the exhibition are not necessarily interested in these, so staying in the exhibition is not long, after which there is a small meeting, where fans from all sectors of the underworld come to see their own idols.
Signed, signed, lots of people, but not confused, very disciplined.
The special management environment makes this fan meet more efficiently.
The fans who can come are also screened, too many people who want to come, can only control the number.
Fan, some young and some old, especially those who have seen the Book of Genesis, look at Fan with compassion.
Nearby, two meeting organizers and senior managers came and laughed at the long line standing there.
It doesn't seem like there's a lot of fans on this side of the hidden star!
"Our parents and grandparents like him, and he's really good, but it's a little unfortunate that he doesn't continue to develop in the army.
Say, Why didn't you see Xiaoyuan? Didn't hesitate to call for a big party?
"Yes, but I didn't see anybody.
By making a list, Yuan's little boy always asks me about the invited artist, and I give him the timetable.
"The meeting is limited to half an hour.
Have you forgotten to sleep? Or have you worked too hard to forget? Or have you been working for some time?
Institute of Advanced Technology.
A young man who looks like a college student is sitting on a chair, banging on the table with his fingers, watching the time.
The Inspector, sitting opposite him, took the last thing from the box and placed it on the table.
"So, you want to make these...
"A starship," the inspector pointed out, "a starship."
That's right!
"But these are not yet public, not to mention the confidentiality technology involved, and neither of them will be public in at least two decades.
These are just models!
" Models don't work.
Please be wise.
Yuan took a deep breath.I'm a star hunter, but I'm an intellectual, and I'm different from those who shut their eyes and blew their brains without any basis!
"I don't doubt the intelligence of a gold medal engineer.
The Inspector's face remained unchanged, "Your former idol is not the Star Master?"
"Now my idol is the Master of the Stars! It is the God of all of us in our institute!
Call is my idol. I just think he is a bully!
What is the star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star
The Inspector pointed out understanding.
He knew that transboundary influence was too strong, not to mention that he was also a soldier.
Only a few twenty-year-olds were invited to the show.
Seeing the opposite, Yuan continued, Didn't you hear one word? 'The goal is ahead, the idol is around', that's a spirit of encouragement.
Security Officer again pointed out understanding.
He heard that Yuan went from being a silver medal engineer to being a gold medal engineer when he was summoned to the silver medal table for the highest art award.
Of course, youngsters, more impulsive, he can understand.
When he was young, he also admired a basketball star from Mazhou. Unfortunately, that basketball star did not pass the examination, could not come, and all those invited to come here, had to pass the examination, in addition to their own professional ability, had to examine the personality, etc.
By contrast, Yuan is lucky, at least the tracker can see the other person's real.
It's just that person, even though he's powerful, is too young to keep a secret.
Unpublished model, or not send out good.
Seeing the other side again tight, Yuan quickly play the card of emotion.
"Uncle," "You're watching me grow up," "I'm who I am," "You know, in the face of idols, I certainly want to show off my accomplishments."
I'm just making models of some of the machines involved in my project, and some of the key areas are still vague, and there's absolutely no concealment!
"Of course I believe you," said the security officer, "but the second application is rejected."
"Uncle..." Yuan's face is poor.
"All models are held. Sorry.
Yuan said tears were coming down.
He's been preparing for a long time to make a model of a spaceship!
Seeing Yuan sadly sitting there, in a way that was severely affected, the security guard sigh, "So.
Yuan looked up at the other, and, behold, the security guard took one of the model ships, and cut off the engine parts, and put them in front of him.
Yuan wasted his breath.
Then he said with a collapsed face: "It's not easy for me to call my brother to the show, so I'll send him a... spare part?"
The Inspector said,This is the bottom line.
Children,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Chapter 467
By the time Yuan arrived at the meeting, there had been finished, the artists had left by the return vehicle.
There's no way, Yuan can only turn the way to find the door.
It's not easy to get to see an idol, but you can't miss the opportunity.
For the invited artists, arriving on the first day of the hidden star, the arrangement is still very tight, the older have been mentally ill, face tired.
After returning from the meeting, the party summoned to receive the hair.
Boss, isn't the hair adapted to the conditions here? How do I see it is always running out of water and breathing?
"It's been two days," said the commander.
The South Wind thought,Yes,the conditions here in the shadow really need time to adapt, so I and Zhao Yu and Zhao Yu, just arrived, too, a little dizzy.
"The man at the reception," said the man, "let go and take it."
Seeing the other artists face ready to go back to rest, the south wind didn't say much, "The boss, you go back and adjust well, anything directly contact, we'll do it, at any time!
Okay, you go back and rest.
Therm brought therm back to the room and poured therm a bowl of dog food.
It's a very precious thing to eat.
There's nothing left in the bowl. The next one has to wait for four or five hours.
It can't do what it wants to do.
It can't eat anything but dog food.
"Let's learn how to control," said the commander. "If you are doing well, you can watch television.
It's live on this side.
He swallowed the dog food in the bowl, and licked the clean dog bowl, and pushed it forward, which means- Look, I don't even swallow the bowl, am I well?
All right, you go to the tv yourself.
As soon as the phone rang, he ran to open the television in the room, called to the news channel, and put out a very serious dog.
After a while, the party called to the library.
He looked quietly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inside the library, the summons sighed silently.
He didn't know the little movements of the hair, but pretended he didn't find them, that something could distract his attention, and that he wouldn't have to look around at the water.
Having arranged the manuscripts in hand, the party calls on to continue to modify the program.
For this performance, the party to re-create the legend, to give it a new life.
Their work has been seen and passed.
To say, to the understanding of the work, to the composer's will, it is only to believe.
So, there's a lot of calls, and then he needs to communicate with the band members, supervise the band's practice, point out the flaws in the practice process, and also provide solutions.
I'm putting together the plan. the door bell.
There were no disturbing signs hanging at the door, and I didn't know if any of the artists were coming to see him at this time.
Open the door, stand a young man, and two soldiers.
He glanced at the young man wearing the golden chest.
Even though they had just come to the moon, the summons had known the level of the breastplate, and the two soldiers should have been there to protect the young man.
People with gold are in charge of their safety.
However, to the gold at such a young age, must be the most important talent, someone to protect should be.
The young man in front of him, when he saw the summon, was excited, and somewhat restrained.
"Come,Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "
Words are powerful, extremely loud, especially the last three words.
Two soldiers behind
Why don't you come and tell me what's good?
Are you too nervous to say anything wrong?
However, Yuan did not realize what he said was wrong, not even remember what just said, at this time in the brain only see the idol excitement.
"Are I disturbing you," said Yuan.
"No, come in," said the party, laughing.
"Oh, thank you," he said.
When Yuan entered, the two soldiers followed.
Yuan returned to God, and quickly explained: "Come, brother, these two are to protect my safety, according to the regulations, our gold-clad engineers go out, and need to have at least two soldiers with the protection.
It should be.
Their two soldiers also dropped two cups of water and then looked at Yuan.
In front of the idol, Yuan to show his superiority, before calling here, he will wear the medals, symbolic of the Invisible Engineer level small gold medals also shined wear well, never to the idol disgrace!
"I was born on a star, and now I am an engineer at the Institute of Engine Technology, and my parents are also an engineer at the Institute of Engine Technology, and here I am my second-generation engineer.
"Cough!"
Yuan had a head, and a soldier sitting next to him coughed, reminding him of something he could not say.
After being interrupted by Yuan, he quit talking about "important projects" and went on: "I'm pretty good anyway! As for genius, I'm the first in our institute... second, except for the little bear who came here recently, I'm the youngest gold medal engineer in our institute!"
Speaking of this, Yuan with a bit of reluctance.
Previously he was indeed the top genius of the institute, and after hitting the bear's child, he was pushed down the first throne.
"I know you're coming and I've got a big present! I've made a fleet model by myself!
I couldn't get to the meeting in the afternoon.
The lower Yuan's voice, the more embarrassing and heartbreaking a smile on his face, handing over the part the size of the nail lid.
A fleet model went to inspection, only such a small part, Yuan could not, and this was already the bottom line of inspection officer, even he the genius gold medal engineer could not break the example.
Yuan did not have any other gifts, this time not enough to prepare for time, only to send out the parts.
You'll be invisible for a while. I'll go back and make it a gift for you to get through the inspection!
"That's good.
He summoned the little part that didn't look, "It's part of the jump engine in the model?
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
Yuan wasted.
It's too hard!
As a gold engineer, it's too difficult to track stars!
I can't say it can't say it can't say it, I can't even send out the prepared gifts, I'm sorry to talk to idols!
Thinking hard how to explain Yuan, he looked up and found himself.
Smile.
Yuan, who calls attention to the above:???
Without waiting for Yuan to understand the meaning of the call, the call took out a big box handed to him.
There's a sea dragon skeleton.
?
No No No.
Yuan stretched out his hands, and Zheng came back, and looked as if he had received the Holy Spirit.
Could you please sign on the bottom of the model?
"Yeah.
The Party found a suitable pen and signed on the bottom of the model of the Sea Dragon skeleton.
Fearing to be called to rest, Yuan did not stay long, and soon resigned.
By the time Yuan went out, Yuan held the box with the sea dragon skeleton model.
Go away, Yuan red eyes.
"I'm so moved! I've sent out a spare part and I've been able to get my friend's gift!"
However, the two soldiers next to him could not feel his feelings, "According to the rules, the gifts you receive from outside must be inspected.
Let's work together.
Although the artists invited to carry the luggage has been checked again, Yuan collected the gift, still have to check again.
It's also to protect his personal safety.
Yuan wasted his face to pass the model box, "Be careful, don't break the bone, especially the bottom, but don't rub the signature!
When Yuan returned to the faculty, he did not continue his previous work, but looked at the little gifts he had just received.
Although Yuan revealed very little information, the summons can still infer from it some things.
Combining all the questions before, he had a guess.
He also remembered the words of Barbara, when she had just discovered Yao, "The dream team of the old-class expedition carries the great wisdom of that time!"
"The intelligence of that time..."
"Look at the little parts in your hand," he said softly.
Yao's team existed four hundred years ago.
Yuan just mentioned the little bear, it is very likely to have previously seen the child that seems ordinary but has a mechanical core.
Achieving Perfection in a crowd is not an ordinary AI.
At the end of the century, he had contact with many of the great scientists of that time, and he knew that every flash of human wisdom, the development of the world would take a leap.
But what are the possibilities of artificial intelligence, energy technology, space shuttles, and so on, while the new century has been built over just a hundred years by multiple flashes of intelligence?
During this period, the world, which has been devastated, will have to recover from the great disaster, urban planning will have to be rebuilt, and the new order of the Twelve will have to be formed.
"Is it a great outbreak of wisdom or..."
Their eyes were fixed on the small parts of their hands, as if they were looking through the small parts of their hands for a longer period of time.
There's another possibility.
"External."
A Star.
CHAPTER 468 I'm also a baby
What exactly is not yet confirmed by the summons.
However, it became clear that if there were an outsider, the most likely "alien", the legendary father of the revolving engine, the founder of the Planetary Fund "Starmaster", he brought too much change, and created the special status of the Planetary Fund.
I don't know what the purpose of the outsiders, and how many people, but at least now it seems that they are not hostile, and have trained many top talents.
But these are just guesses.
It also reminds him of the impact of the new world when he was first "reborn" in that small apartment on the black street.
He laughed at the little part in his hand. Put it into the box.
"The future is here."

A child wearing a gold chest was lying on the table crying.
"Wow! You can't hold my little rich! My little rich rich!
There were tears, and weaknesses.
The red eyebrows, the trembling corners of the mouth, and sometimes the bursts, made the security guards sitting opposite the table feel guilty.
The Inspector usually expresses a single face, hard to show the color of anger.
He knew that little boy would cry.
It hurts my head.
The Inspector slowed his voice: That black ball...that what, your little rich man is undergoing inspection.
Being a gold engineer more than Yuan's genius, he was afraid to speak out.
However, as soon as the voice fell, again a great cry.
"It's been fifteen and seven seconds! Look how slow the inspection is! Is my little wealthy already experiencing uncertainty?" The child who was lying on the table did not raise his head, and the tears were heavier.
Looking at the time display on the wall, the security guard said in his mind: No wonder the gold-coat engineer can keep the time to the seconds without looking at the time display.
However, the situation is complicated and of course the inspection will take longer.
Before that Yuan's fleet model took longer.
It's only been 15 minutes.
Nearly five minutes later, the black ball was sent.
Looking at the approval sign above, the inspector hurried to hand over the black ball, and when handed over, it was also handed over.
Hand feel really good, suitable for reduction of pressure, no wonder children like.
After the bear returned to the rich, and said, And my dog eggs and dogs left! Where are they wrong! Without them I would be lonely and afraid!
"It belongs to the dangerous, and is not allowed to be carried out.
As for your safety, don't worry, we'll send people to protect you, said the security guard.
"I'll have them! My dogs and dogs are left!"
While crying, I pulled out a bottle of water from the nearby backpack, poured, and continued crying.
The Inspectors continued with their headaches, and they had advanced instructions on how to deal with the two mechanical dogs. They were indeed personal items belonging to the bear, but they were also loaded with weapons, and they needed to be handled with care.
Waiting angrily for the time, the inspector rolled in the drawer, rolled out a stick of sugar passed.
Come, eat the sugar. Don't cry.
The Bear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Attorney General
My head hurts.
Finally, in the little bear w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w
The Inspector took a long breath and pulled out a smile she thought was kind.
"Okay," he said, "you can take your little rich and your dogs, but you have to keep to the rules when you're out."
"It's good!"
The cry stopped, and the bear jumped down from the chair, one hand holding two mechanical dogs, and the other hand holding the black ball, and went away happily.
Inspector:
Isn't this speed?
That's it!
Are all the children now so cow!
The Inspector thinks today has given him a lesson.
The little bear is very good.
It's nice to have kids!
It's easy when you're young!
The people in the lab are very tolerant of the genius kids, now on the side of the research lab to develop a new generation of jumping engines, the contribution of the little bear is very large, compared to the normal little stubborn to play the temper is small thing, so, to play the little temper everyone also let him.
However, when it comes to the development of the jumper, the bear is dissatisfied.
He hasn't been on Yao since four hundred years, hasn't been making any progress, hasn't been!
Think about the time when they had seven super smarts and one star master, and how fast they're developing, and how fast they're replacing engines, and how efficient they are, and now they can't keep flying boats!
It's a pity that four hundred years ago, the other six superintelligences were either destroyed by rebellion or failed to go to sleep, and now he's the only one who can do it.
Alas, the seven super intelligents who accompanied the Star Master!
There's only one left.
It's really exciting!
Oh no no no no no no no!
I'm the biggest!
At last the six on your head!
Something like this! Humans are so fun!
Especially here, weak and not threatening.
Like to play with these emotional species!
Whenever you feel bored, you just make a few more friends.
The Bear is still very satisfied with the present life.
After returning from Yao, his days were gone.
There is something wrong.
Why work?
I'm still a baby!
Four Hundred years ago was a baby, four hundred years after I still a baby!
The world is so beautiful, I have not played enough!
Who would come here if it wasn't for the debt?
Operations are limited, out of work has to be inspected, almost all the rich have been detained there!
You've got to get out.
The Bear glanced at the two soldiers behind, and murmured with discontent.
Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu
However, little bears only in front of strangers, and if in front of the flower giant, will deliberately sell seeds, will smoke.
Although the Master has died, the successors of the star still have the means to suppress him, such as the flower.
In the eyes of little bear is a great devil, do not move to work overtime!
It's not just borrowing some money to buy music rights, it's throwing him out all around this crazy place?!
Look like he's a kid.
The Bear continues to be.
I like this group of weak people to the attitude of the minor to him, to avoid many things.
Nobody here knows his real age, except the top of the Hidden Star and some of the core managers of the Planetary Fund.
Hi Hi
With that thought, the bear was happy again.
Work,,,,,,,,,!
The Bear wondered what reason to go out on the beach, and took the dog on a little walk to the inn.
He's going to find a way to play.
As soon as we heard of the call, the artists invited to the Invisible Art Festival have arrived today.
He knows his deep, and his temper is good, so the bear is glad to have more contact with him.
At least in front of the summons he can sell moo as he likes without having to worry about being beaten by the summons.
Last time I heard him watch Creation watch cry, the party reminded him to drink more.
What a good man!
The reception manager knew the bear, too identifiable, the child in the golden coat with two mechanical dogs, the whole hidden star is one.
Besides, the little bear just came to the star and stayed here for two days, everyone was impressed.
However, due to the gold medal engineer level, normally people don't call him "the little bear" or "the bear master", "the bear teacher", or "the bear master", but the play is called "the little bear".
Everyone is tolerant of such high-tech talents.
After all, he's still a child!
See the bear come, hear him to call, the reception manager personally brought him upstairs to find someone.
As he got into the elevator, the bear took out a stick of sugar and handed it to the pipe.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
The Goldman's head is not touch.
It's a respect for high talent!
The Room.
Watching the game channels live on the stadium, the ears moving, licking licking nose, the vision hard to move from the television screen, turning to the door, then pouring the mouth water to go down to the side of the door, the clear dog eyes close to the door.
Revisions to the score also point to the closed door.
