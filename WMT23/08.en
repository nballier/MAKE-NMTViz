Chapter 805
"In the East?"
Zhou had some hesitation, because neither the principal nor the teacher had warned the new students not to come near the Eastern School District, and they had not given any specific reasons, but from the tone of their speech they could hear that the Eastern School District was dangerous.
"You have a deep misunderstanding of the Eastern School District, which is almost the same as here, except that the two School Districts are managed completely differently, and they live in real terror, and you live in real happiness.
Chen looked into Zhou's eyes and said, " Compared to you, they are actually closer to hope, because they at least know who they are and know how to get out of it.
Chen didn't deceive Zhou, either the Eastern or the Western students, they were all trapped in this school.
Their memories were altered, repeating the life of the black behind the scenes, and the good and bad students of the Eastern School know to look for the dead, to think of a way to leave.
"Eastern students are closer to hope. But I have heard that only unwanted garbage from the West is sent there."
Zhou has been talked about,but he still has some uncertainty in his heart.
No matter what the criteria are, any school that treats its students as garbage must be a garbage school.
Chen reaches for the high wall between the two schools: Do you know why that wall exists?
"Why?
"Because schools are afraid of losing control, they re-form humanity in all kinds of ways, but they forget humanity is the most complex thing in the world.
Things have happened, and whatever you forget, the wounds that are left will be stamped on your heart.
Nothing remembers, doesn't mean they don't exist, so some of the school's plans are destined to fail.
Some of the members didn't understand why she said this, but they felt that she had something to say.
Their curiosity wasted, and Chen continued to tell them the truth of the school, and finally succeeded in attracting the interest of the members of the society.
"So we're gone now? I really don't believe there's going to be a painting room I dreamed of," said Zhou.
It's not the time.
Chen looked back at the darkness of the 413 dormitory still sleep, but his body has changed greatly.
If you look closely, you will find that Chen's shadow is different from that of other people, black as ink, as if all the light that shines there would be swallowed up.
It looks like it's gotten much stronger.
It's a good thing for Chen, when he wakes up, Chen will lead the students back to the Eastern school district again to look for the bad guys.
Doing so would strengthen one's own strength, and it would be possible to stir up the school's dead water, and to cover up another "murderer" in the college.
"It's still a time for me to prepare as much as I possibly can for myself before my master finds out about my little bug.
Chen turned to Wang, the story of the other three members of the society he had all understood, only the first to enter the society lame boy: "The next place we go is the dormitory Wang.
Go to my dorm?Wing's reaction was a little strange, and he shook his hands.Well, there's nothing good about my dorm.
When you say this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chen Jiang gave a gentle hug to Wang's shoulder: "Why don't you let us go?
"I...
Wang thought for half an hour about what to say, and finally turned his eyes to the other direction: nothing, let's go straight.
"All right.
Wang lived in the 413 bedrooms of the West school district, Lins lived in the 413 bedrooms of the East school district.
Their number was exactly the same, but in the 413 bedrooms in the West, there were students in the other beds, and in the East, there were only people in the fourth bed, and the other beds were empty.
Don't tell anybody about the secrets of our society, let's be as low as possible, and there are teachers like me here, and there are teachers who don't speak as well.
"I don't have much time left," he said. "I'll go to the 413 room," he said.
There are four dormitory buildings in the West. The number of students is several times greater than in the East West. It is not yet time to turn off the lights.
"It's about the same as the East. "
Chen, acting very naturally, followed by four students, entered the first building.
The door of the little house of the host was closed, but the window was open, and there was a mother of more than fifty who was humming, and she seemed to be in good mood.
A notice was placed next to the small window, which stated that students were forbidden to use electrical power in the dormitory, and that students were forbidden to cook in the dormitory themselves.
"I remember a good copy of the announcement in the dormitory building of the Eastern School District -- there was a recent incident where students were forbidden to go outside after the lights went out.
A wall, is almost two worlds, like inside and outside.
Passing through the corridor, Chen and several members of the community came to the 413 dormitory door.
"This dormitory has nothing to do with other dormitories.
King opened the door, and when he entered the room, all the others in the room seemed to do their own thing, as if he were not there, and no one spoke to him.
After a few steps into the king's city, the boy who slept next to the door suddenly lifted the mosquito net and stared at him: "How many times have you said? Come in and close the door.
It's hard for a boy to say something. He doesn't know why he seems to hate Wang.
"He doesn't shut the door because there is someone in the back, and if you need an apology, there are a few of us who can apologize for you, but we don't know what kind of an apology you need."
The Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed
"Mr. White, this is the fourth bed, because there is no one to stay, so we are going to put the luggage.
Wang pointed to the fourth bed, on which several luggage boxes were thrown, in which only his luggage was placed under his own bed, and all the others threw the garbage and luggage to the fourth bed.
Chen is very familiar with the fourth bed, he himself lay on the fourth bed of the East school district.
On the way to the fourth bed, although there were no people, there were beds and sheets, but the beds were now spoiled by luggage and garbage.
Zhang : Let's Get a Certificate (Free Birthday Edition)
The clouds over the city, the sky seems to reach.
Liman stood by the window, watching the rain fall through the glass, leaving a trail.
The clock tied on the wall, and the dull time flowed quietly in the little house.
"Five to thirty," said Liman, leaning over, and moving the meat from the window to his desk.
She put the card of the marriage registration on the table in the drawer, and looked at the big letters on the wall-lawful administration, civil service.
"It's raining so hard today," he said. "No one should be registering for marriage."
Liman hum, began to clean, in the empty marriage register only she, beside the divorce registration staff already fifteen minutes before work.
Hello, is it a marriage certificate? The door was pushed open, and a sound of a mature, magnetic man came from the door.
Sounds so good, people must be pretty.
Liman looked up and saw a man dressed in a black rain suit standing at the door of the marriage registration.
He looked ordinary, but he had an unspeakable spirit.
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
"Well, I've made an appointment online for today.
Let me look. What's your name?
"Chang".
Liman entered two words into Chen's computer, and indeed saw his appointment application: "I'm about to go to work, let's go quickly, do you have everything with you?
"It's all here.
The man opened his backpack and began looking inside.
Liman heard a cat call, she looked a little curiously into the man's backpack.
It was packed with a reading machine, a comic book, a doll, a pen, and a big white cat.
"I'm sorry," the man told Liman. "It's all here. I've seen the women's families, and they're very happy with me.
"It looks like you've done a lot of preparation.
When Liman had the information of the man and was ready to start the registration of the woman, she suddenly found that the magnetic strip on the identity card was no longer used, she looked at the name on the woman's identity card, and suddenly realized something.
The man in front came to register to get married, prepared all the information, even brought a cat, but only saw his girlfriend.
"Wait, sir."
Liman stopped his work. Are you going to get married?
"Yeah.
"What about your girlfriend? How do you get together?" Liman laughed bitterly.
The clock tied on the wall, and the more the rain came, the man held his lips, and looked up to Liman, and she came and stood behind me.
The rain fell on the windows, and the air in the room gradually solidified.
Don't joke, sir,the marriage must be done by both sides.I can't help you with this.
Liman covered her chest, she didn't know why suddenly a little breathless.
She's really here. She's everywhere I'm.
The man's eyes were clear, and his tongue was a little stiff.
Looking at the man's seriousness, Liman holds a card that had been demagnetized, she suddenly thought of a possibility.
Turn over the woman's address book, on the page with the woman's name, covering the police station's declaration of death, the time of death is still years before.
"Mr.
Liman wanted to say, but looked at the man's stubborn look, some emotion.
Looking over the man's backpack, Liman looked at one of the items in the bag.
Are these things that girl used? Are these things kept hidden? Are these the memories of the two of them? Is this the cat that the girl girl was raising?
For a moment, Liman understood why a man would bring a lot of stuff to the marriage register, and why a man would say a woman has always been with him.
Liman with the girl's ID, she didn't know what to say, to comfort men, or to tell men the cruel truth.
Liman opened his lips slowly, but he did not say anything, she looked at like a childlike man, with a complicated feeling.
She tried to keep her smile: Sir, you must love her. How do you know her
"It was she who followed me. The first love letter I ever received was from her.
The man washed his eyes as if he were remembering his past: The first date we had was with the school.
A::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
"The private college in West, where she had hers and her past, I stood in the hall where she had practiced dancing, leaning against the mirror, leaning against her, and we were talking to each other.
Liman listened quietly and a picture appeared in his mind.
On a quiet night, the two in the abandoned mother school remembering the past, once the college was so lively, now only the two of them, back to back, cling to each other, what a beautiful love!
"The second appointment was in a mental hospital, and she was dressed in a red dress, and she was beautiful.
"A mental hospital?"
"Because of my parents, that day I..."
I'm sorry.
Before the man finished, Liman apologized, she did not like to uncover the scars of others, maybe the parents are another pain in the man's heart.
"The third date was in a building, and I would have stuck the unhappy man in the elevator, and given him a life-long lesson.
You can really love your girlfriend. I think she will be very happy when she knows about this.
She was right next to me.
The gentle man remembered the elevator wrapped in black hair.
That must have been romantic.
Leeman thinks the man in front of him is just a boyfriend.
"The fourth appointment was in the morgue of the Faculty of Medicine, and she was injured, but she didn't tell me, she sat quietly with me, as if she had been sneaking at me.
The man's voice was very good, the dust with the ripe rhythm, he remembered the past, the lightness of the feeling even let Liman unconsciously ignore the underground mortuary, the special meeting place.
"The fifth date was on the roof of a small town, and it was like today, and it was raining outside, and I was with her.
Compared to the abandoned school, mental hospital, and underground mortuary, the normal date for Liman was a little uncomfortable: Did you meet her that day?
The man nodded gently.I stood at the top of the town, crying out to the strange world.I don't believe there is anything more romantic in this world than a lifetime.
"Wow!"
Liman heard many stories, but not Chen's story shocked, perhaps because she saw the death certificate on the homepage, already knew the reason for the result.
"Then..."
"She's asleep," Chen said, "I've been waiting for her for a long time.
Their death proved that moment like a needle pierced Liman's heart, her tears unconsciously poured into her eyes.
Lower her head, Liman dressed as she was looking for something, while the computer was covering her face, sneaked a tear, the end of the story she had already known.
No one talked in the room, and after a long time the man broke down, and his hands were placed gently on the empty seat next to him, as if there were sitting his girlfriend: "Our sixth date..."
It doesn't matter what the man says. Liman knows that the man is trapped in a cage called love after his wife's affair. He thinks his girlfriend is still in the room.
Because of deep love, refuse to believe the fact that the other has left.
Liman wanted to tell the truth, but she really didn't dare to tell.
She put her face behind the computer, entered all the information on the application, she wanted to help the man in front of her complete a dream, and when she pressed the confirm key, the computer played out a different page of home registration information.
The girl died many years ago and there is no such person in the census.
Reality As a pool of ice water washed over Leeman, she looked at the man's face, which was caught in memories, and bit her lips: "Sir, we don't have enough data here, the system is upgrading, and we can't help you for the time being, and you'll come in a week."
Leeman wants to help the man in sight, even if he himself does a similar, not legal, little red book.
"Well, that troubles you.
The man slowly got up and went out, and when he came to the door, he suddenly took off his raincoat and put it over his head, as if there was another man standing beside him: Zhang Ya, don't go too far from me, it's raining.
Liman saw clearly in the room, that man under the raincoat, except for himself, there was no more.
Looking at the man's distance, Liman wiped his eyes: "Maybe this is love, love for you, loyalty to you, heart for you, end for you."
Chapter 806 Possible "gates"
There are so many things lying in the bed, and if the student of the fourth bed came back, where would he sleep? Chen seemed to be saying to himself, Would he sleep in the bed of the others?
Since he entered, the students in the 413 dorm have looked at him intentionally. After all, it is difficult not to pay attention to the person who entered the room wearing the school work clothes.
You're a school teacher A tall, thin, student sitting on the bed opposite the fourth bed, wearing thick glasses, looked a little strange.
Put on bed sheets and cushions, and you say this bed can't be used for people? Chen smiled and looked at the thin student. Maybe you just can't see him.
Chen, standing beside the fourth bed, carried all the above luggage to the ground.
"Hey! Don't disturb our stuff! "The mosquito-the man at the door looked out again.
"I'm saving you. This bed has its own owner. He's been in this school.
Chen has found many things in the 413 bedrooms of the Eastern school district, and he also expects the 413 bedrooms of the West school district.
Do you know the legend of the fourth bed of the 413 bedroom?The glassman stretched his face.Are you telling the truth that we were there to scare the king of a city
It's true, and you'll know when you meet.
After leaving the blanket, Chen took off the pillow and the mask, to make sure there was nothing hidden inside.
"You say that's where the fourth bed is, and you're just moving around with it?"The thin student put down his glasses, and he didn't like Chen, perhaps because Chen helped Wang speak, which was the exact opposite of the atmosphere in their bedrooms.
"I don't care, I don't live in this bedroom anyway.
Angry at him,,,the first to look for you.
Chen's way of speaking is very different from the people's teachers in the minds of some students, of course he himself is a fake, does not care about these.
Lifting off the bed below the bed sheet, Chen no longer fight with the people in the dormitory, the line is stuck on the bed sheet.
There were five fingerprints left on the side of the wall.
Isn't that's also your evil play? Chen grabbed the blood fingerprint with his fingernails and put it down on the tip of his nose and smelled it, which was supposed to be a solid blood.
Why is there blood on the fourth bed?
Teacher,What is that? Because the place of the blood fingerprint is very hidden, King one city also just seen.
"I've studied painting and I'm very familiar with this smell.
Chen looked at the other students in the dormitory: "Someone wants to make a bad play.
He didn't go on the topic, took out Linth's cell phone lighting, and looked down at the sheet.
It's very similar to a scene in the East. There's something written under the bed.
Tiny Words should be printed a little with a knife.
Why doesn't everybody talk to me?
Why is everyone ignoring me?
"I didn't lie to them! There really are ghosts! I really saw ghosts in the toilet!"
It's dangerous! Why don't people believe me?
Chen, looking at these words, felt some familiar, he continued to look down, found a more familiar name.
"I swear to myself," said Lin, "it's a real mess in the bathroom!
"I know everybody hates me, wants to joke with me, I am happy, I know, but the toilet is really crazy! I really didn't lie this time!
Every word on the board was very useful, and in the middle some of the marks of blood, seemed to the engraver accidentally cut off the hand.
These are also left by Lin, but his descriptions do not seem to be the same as those in the school's notebooks!
Chen was very sensitive to find the problem, the diary said that Lin thought very skinny, like to make fun of others, finally the whole class couldn't accept him to the toilet, together to make a joke, finally to fright him dead.
But there's something else under the sheets, and Lin thought she wasn't scared by her classmates, she actually saw something in the toilet.
Thinking terrified, Chen's eyes shrinking, he now doesn't know exactly who to believe.
There was no doubt that was the owner of the fourth bed, whether in the East or the West.
"If this bedroom had all that was in memory, then the words under the bed sheet would have been true, but Lin thought was dead, and how could he come back and write under the bed?"
Only the fourth bed had no one in the room, as was the case at the time.
Lynce was frightened, and the fourth bed was empty, and there were five others in the bedroom.
Lin thought the toilet was a big thing, so after he died he ran back to the wind and left all kinds of marks, but no one cared.
"No wonder he would write such a sentence, and become a ghost, and a living man of course can not see.
Chen didn't know if the five people in the bedroom were the five people who lived with Lin thought at first, or if they were not, then they would be very unlucky.
In the East, every living person who has just entered the school is called Lin, the name of which implies uncertainty and curse, and is targeted by all evil spirits.
But thinking in a different direction, Li wants to graduate and needs to replace the dead, from the point of view of Li Li, Lin thought the name also represents hope.
It's getting more and more interesting, the curse in the eyes of the living, the hope in the eyes of the wicked, what has Lin thought done at all in this school?
Chen can be sure that Lins had a deep connection with the school, and that even if he was not the owner of the school, he must have had a connection with the owner of the school.
"If only I could find him, or find the last one," he said.
Chen continued to watch, the words on the floor more and more force, engraved the person's mentality from anxiety gradually to despair.
"I really see a ghost. Would you believe me once?"
Listen to my voice I'm here!
"Well, I don't expect you to believe me, I just want you to never go to that toilet on the top of the building! Remember! Never go!
"It's over, they're still running out..."
This is where the information under the sheet stops, Chen can feel the desperation of the engraver from word to word.
"The toilet at the top of the teaching building? "Where did Lin think he was killed?"
The Ghost School scene is the most complex, the largest, and the most difficult task he has ever done, and the various clues and riddles are intertwined, as if it were an invisible mist.
It is not possible to a single sex, Chen can only start from the most fundamental point.
There must have been a pusher, assuming that pusher was Linth, and the door he pushed out was most likely to be the toilet at the top of the teaching building!
Chapter 807 Black
Chen's eyes became bright, and he found a very critical information.
"The Ghost School is a four star scene, I have never touched four stars, and all the experience before is not applicable here, want to know more, only go to see it yourself."
Chen didn't know how long a man's attachment would take to make such a big nightmare that he couldn't even do it with Dr. and Zha.
"Maybe there was a door in the toilet itself, which was accidentally opened when the students caught Lin.
Chen also had a door in his own ghost house, and he has not been able to get close to it, so he guessed Lin thought he might have been in the same situation then.
He just avoided the door, and Lin thought he had opened it.
"No matter what the truth, the toilet on the top of the teaching building must be seen! "
There was no indication on the sheets that toilet was in the east or in the west.
"Let's get out of here first, and you'll go to the test room with me," said Chen.She's already gained enough under the sheets, and to stay in 413 is meaningless, but it will attract the attention of students in the building.
"But we're not just...
King wanted to say something, but was interrupted by the torch, he gently dragged King King's arm.
Listen to the teacher where he let us go.
Chen said that was just playing the next game. The 413 students had a very bad attitude towards them, saying they were not sure that they were just going to the next step.
Let's get something and come back.
Thermomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomo
After leaving the boys' apartment building, Chen saw many people running towards the experimental building, where it seemed to have gone wrong.
Zhong just flipped over to understand the anatomy, the class teacher would have handled himself, it is necessary to surprise so many people? Chen is very curious about the situation there, but also just curious, now in the past is self throwing the net, the best choice is to avoid them.
Teacher, are we going to the laboratory? We have just come back from there.
Go to the first classroom and we'll go and see before the school reacts.
Chen has been changing places, even the people of the school have come to search, can only follow behind him ashes.
As time passed, fewer and fewer people were on campus.
Have you heard any strange talk about toilets here? Chen went and asked, Have you been to the top of the teaching building
No. Several students shook their heads.
This school looks normal, but there is danger everywhere, and after you get there, you must listen to my command.
Chen-They went around the teaching building, the teaching building in the east school district is very fancy, three buildings behind, each building has four floors.
"Your school seems to love the number four.
At this time there were no more students, the classroom was black, only the corridor was lit.
"It's the first time I've been in a classroom at this late hour.
Wang's walking was slow, and as soon as he approached the teaching building, his expression became very unnatural, seeming to have come from within to the place.
Wang's changes Chen's attention, the lame boy seems to have encountered some very unpleasant things in the classroom.
Follow me, and let us go straight to the top, no matter what we see in the other classrooms.
Before entering the classroom, Chen looked at the surrounding environment, each classroom has two stairs on the left and on the right, and the toilet is near the left stairs.
Zhou was completely unable to understand Chen's behavior, each step of the other seems to have been thought through, but if you think about it, you will find that the half-money relationship between each other is not useful, but Chen's appearance is of course deep and unpredictable, one can't hate to lift his skull to see what is inside.
"Don't get out of the team," said Zhang. "I'll get out of the team," he said.
Come on, it's a community.
Zhong's eyes were red, and he was eight feet tall, holding a pink girl's phone, and he had no sense of contradiction.
"I'm really crazy," he said. "I'm going to come with you to the lecture hall to find out about the supernatural.
Zhou unwillingly entered the stairs, few did not stop, a breath ran to the top.
The classroom is very quiet, and the day is just two extremes.
"I and Zhang torch forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward
" Teacher, can you not go in..."
Wang stood by Chen, his face pale, cold sweat flowing down his cheeks, his eyes constantly moving: I thought of a very bad thing, that thing happened here!
"What is it? " Chen was the first time that Wang expressed such an expression.
"I just remembered in secret that I was involved in that thing, that I was forced into it, that I didn't get into the toilet, and that I survived, and those who got into it all died.
Wang began to speak, he with a cry.
Everyone who entered this toilet was dead. Chen touched Wang's hand.You're just a newborn.How can you remember this toilet?
"I don't know; I didn't mean it!
Teacher, let's go! Don't open that door!
"I've come here and I won't give up.
Chen took the king's hand and pushed the toilet door out with force.
Don't! Don't push the door!
In the Scream of the King, Chen opened the door of the toilet, he looked inside the toilet.
There was a rubber face on the ground, painted on the walls with blood fingerprints and the five organs of the person, and entered it as if were being stared at from every side.
Lin thought was caught here.
Chen picked up the rubber face and looked at it, determined that there was no danger, and put it into the backpack.
He proceeded slowly and took a few photos from Lin's cell phone as he passed through the first passage of the toilet.
Everything is fine in the toilet, no stranger.
There doesn't seem to be any problem, but I always feel a little wrong.
Chen looked at the close door, unconsciously pushed, the door is still.
"Is there anyone inside?
He bent to look at the gap below the wall, where there was a pair of black leather shoes.
Chapter 808
There's someone in the room!
Seeing the black shoes, Chen recalled the white teacher of the east school district, the other one wearing such a pair of pure black leather shoes.
Don't come here first.
Chen took two steps back, stretched Lin's cell phone into the gap, and quickly took a photo.
Looking down at his cell phone, Chen didn't appear to be worried about anything, only a pair of leather shoes, didn't hide "people".
Linth's cell phone can take a picture of a ghost and something special, and there's nothing in the picture that says there's only one pair of shoes in the room, but if there's no one in the room, how's the door locked?
The bathroom door only locked from inside, and the position of the black shoes, standing in the same way as inside, unlike from outside locked in.
"Teacher, are you mistaken? Who would go to the toilet on the top floor of the classroom in the evening?
Zhong's memories were relaxed in his mind, and he remembered something that was vague and could not be explained clearly, but that did have an effect on him, causing him to see changes that no one had noticed, for example, he began to distance himself from the other members of the society, and he preferred to stay with Chen, and Chen seemed to be of the same sort as him.
"You stay here, and if anyone comes near, let me know at once."
Chen used force to shake the shutter door, using violence to open it.
Many faces were painted in the narrow space, standing inside, as if were being stared at by many.
Why put a pair of leather shoes?
Chen didn't find anything unusual in the first row, he came to the second row, with previous experience, this time he took out the cell phone to shoot the row.
The photograph shows a pair of shoes in the second compartment as well, except that they are not black leather shoes, but an old blue sneakers.
Their positions are the same. What is the point of this?
Chen looked at the previous six intervals, each of which had a pair of shoes, all of which were men's shoes, had ball shoes, had travel shoes, had flat shoes, all had different scales, should belong different people.
"The first pair of black leather shoes are very similar to the white teacher shoes should be worn by adults, and the other five pairs of shoes are worn by students, does each pair of shoes represent a person?
Lin was initially caught by the whole class. Isn't the owner of the shoes the one who was most hostile to Lin Lin?
The biggest difference between a ghost and a living person is that they are composed of resentment and negative emotions, and the adjectives of understanding and kindness are completely out of touch with them.
No matter what a man was before Lin, in the moment when he became a wicked, his mind and body must be swallowed up by hatred, which is one of the wicked's obsessions, which is the foundation of his existence.
Capture their own people trapped in a chamber with their own companions, to Chen's understanding of the wicked, they probably do such things.
Teacher! Someone is coming over to the teaching building! Zhou, with the help of Wang, stood at the toilet door and shouted to Chen: They seem to be coming over to the experiment building!
"Coming for us?" Chen grabbed his time to the last door, and he consciously took out his cell phone to take a picture, but was surprised to find that the door of the seventh door had been removed.
The Seventh Door According to Chen's previous guess, the door related to Lin thought was most likely to appear in the toilet, but he did not find it in the toilet.
"Calm down," he said.
Chen, with a slight bite of his tongue, knew that the people downstairs would need some time to get upstairs.
When Chen touched the door frame, he found that the axle of the seventh door had been broken.
He looked down into the seventh compartment, where there were no shoes, only two red shoes.
These two shoes are like a man walking outside the door.
"If every shoe represents a person, then did the last man in the ward run out?" Chen looked around, not knowing if it was psychological or for any other reason, as if the ugly old men on the wall had come to life, and their expressions had changed from what they had just seen.
"All despair and negative emotions in the West are transported to the East West, where the real 'blood gate' is estimated to be the toilet at the top of the East East School's teaching building.
There was a problem that had not been solved, and there was a new problem. Chen's forehead turned blue, and he bit his tongue to keep himself awake.
Teacher! They're upstairs! Let's find a place to hide!
"It's very strange to walk" Chen immediately realized the strangeness, and greeted the torch and Zhu Long to run out of the toilet "Where are they from on the floor?"
"The stairway near the toilet!"
"Okay, let's go down the other side!Be careful not to be seen by them!" Chen had no intention of hitting the other side for a while, and ran down the first floor, but when he passed by King's town, he suddenly stopped.
Their eyes shrinked, and their eyes fell on King's shoes.
Blue sneakers?
Wang is now wearing shoes on his feet and shoes in the second room of the toilet!
"The shoes in the toilet are all men shoes.
When Chen thought about it, he suddenly found the shoes in the toilet were identical to the shoes of the 413 students in the bedroom.
"There are six in the 413 bedrooms, and there are seven separate toilets on the top floor of the teaching building, and six separate toilets on the top floor of the teaching building, and one separate toilet with black leather shoes, representing the teacher, is just enough for seven.
Chen with a frowning:
"Why did Lins hate his roommates? Didn't he just run back to his bedroom to remind his roommates not to come near the toilet?"
Chen had a lot to think about: The East is a mess, the West is more like a souvenir in a glass bottle, and has been stuck in the admission reports for a few days, repeatedly, to know the truth, you have to compare things to the same scenes in two schools.
"The West is too perfect to be true. It's like a child's dream, but the East West is much more real than that.
Chen's eyes shifted from Wang's shoes, and he had decided to take everyone to the Eastern School District.
"Now I have no choice but to look for memories in dreams and to look for truth in reality.
CHAPTER 8 9 They Forced Me!
Those who had run toward the experimental building had entered the stairs, they seemed to have noticed something, came straight to the top toilet, there was no stop in the middle.
Come on!
Chen directly back to Wang, several people quickly ran through the long corridor, came to the other side of the corridor.
They hid in the stairs, holding their breath.
Why did you stop, Mr. White?
"You are looking at the entrance to the third floor, and I am standing on the side of the fourth floor, and I am sure that when they are all on the fourth floor, we will go down again. " Chen was very brave, and he stood directly on the side of the corridor, separated from the long corridor, and looked at the toilet with his dark eyes.
"But..."
Do as I say.
Chen left alone at the entrance to the right on the fourth floor, looking at the left side of the building.
About ten seconds later, he heard the sound of footsteps in the left hallway, and then several men in white appeared on the fourth floor.
What a strange costume? Whole body white? Even shoes white?
There were three men upstairs, all dressed in white, and there was another unusual place, where these guys had scars on their faces.
Not one or two, but like a torch, the whole face burned, looking a little scared.
"They're the administrators of the school?" Chen, looking at them as they entered the toilet, led the other students downstairs, perfectly avoiding them.
Teacher, where are we going next?
"Look for a chance to the East."
Chen's voice wasted, and the people in the white dress brought him a lot of pressure.
"No, why are you so nervous? Like we're doing something weird."
Zhou looked at the nervous Chen and other members of the society, some of them silent: "We are school students, white teacher and school teacher, even if seen by the school, it is not enough to say a few words about us, to pay a lot more for the laboratory's anatomy, and not enough money.
"You still think we are caught, but will be criticized by the school?" Chen stared into Zhou's eyes.
"You'll understand when you get to the East. "
Chen took the students away from the teaching building, along the quiet road slowly near the gym next to the teaching building.
Teacher, aren't we going to the East? What are you doing in the gym?
Find the tools,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chen opened the door of the gym and found many ropes for jumping.
Teacher,these men seem to have come toward us! There was a sound outside the door, and he saw a few white shadows running out of the classroom toward where they were.
How do they know we're in the gym? If it's an accident for the other person to go to the top of the classroom, how do they know I'm in the gym?
Chen had a bad feeling, he pulled the backpack lock, because he had loaded too many things, the backpack looked very drum, can only take in his hand.
"The gym is big enough for them to search for a while.
Chen, carrying his backpack, and then to the king's city, waved: "Come, I will follow you."
Chen had a good intention, but Wang refused this time, and he shook his head, and his eyes were filled with fear, like a child who had made a nightmare: Teacher, I am afraid, I have heard someone cry my name, and the people behind me, I have heard their voice!
When did you hear someone shouting your name? Chen didn't give the king a chance to resist. Time was tight, and he couldn't delay.
Teacher!These men are coming to me!You take me, they will surely find me!
You're my student. just answer my question.
Chen, though he was very curious about what Wang said.
"When I was taken to the top of the teaching building, I suddenly felt uncomfortable, and I wanted to cry, and the corridor was familiar to me, and it seemed that something very bad had happened there.
Wang's eyes were red, like a fish thrown to the shore, even breathing became difficult.
Are you not a newcomer? How do you feel familiar with that corridor?
"I don't know, but sometimes when we go to a strange place, we feel like we've been there before, and that's what I feel like now.
The voice of the king of the city, and his face was white.
"What's with that sound?What did he say to you?"
"I started feeling uncomfortable when I just saw the corridor, and when we got to the toilet door, I suddenly had a picture in my mind.
Wang took a deep breath and paused for a long time before he said, It seems that a long time ago, when I came to this toilet, I was responsible for bringing a very important person into the toilet, and his thin body was standing in the toilet, and the toilet was filled with all kinds of monsters!
Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang
"Yes, that person seems to be my best friend, and I understand that feeling, because few people are willing to be friends with me, but he is an exception.
Wang hit his head hard, and his memory seemed to begin to relax: "When we came to the toilet, I remembered his voice, and he called me by name, and I could be sure that he was, but I couldn't remember who he really was!
Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't
"I didn't mean, they forced me! I'm sorry! We're still the best of friends!"
Calm down!
Wang suddenly collapsed, which no one thought, and he would cause more trouble, Chen decided to throw him down, a hand cut to his neck and neck artery.
"Mr. White" Several other students were shocked.
Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu
Chapter 810 The Other Side of the Wall
Looking at the confused city, Chen's heart could not recover for a long time, he got an important message from the city's just said.
The One Who Induced Lin thought was King!
"I didn't expect the most important people to be around me.
Chen is lucky that even when he enters the world behind the door, he still maintains the good nature, he has just contacted the king of the city, not thinking too much, only because he sees the person alone, wants to help the person to change the situation.
Indeed he did, and Wang has now many new friends, and these friends will not deceive him or discriminate against him.
Chen, through what Wang said when he was mad, probably made it clear what was going on.
Wang and Lins lived in 413 bedrooms, both of whom were not attracted to people for any reason.
Because of their different personalities, they treat their classmates differently.
Wang chose to endure in silence. Lin thought of all kinds of things to bring attention.
These two men should not be considered friends, but are taken together by the deceivers.
The students hated Lin, decided to dress up as a ghost, caught Lin Lin in the toilet on the top floor of the teaching building, in order to retaliate against him.
In order to succeed in deceiving Linth, they found a good relationship with Linth. Chen didn't know how to convince Linth, but he knew that the end result was that Linth agreed to the students.
The king has his own trouble, but the man who pushed Lin thought to the cliff is he.
"Race up! Let's get rid of the ones behind before the king wakes up."
Chen was very cautious, and he went to several places, and found that the white man had not followed.
The atmosphere in the West area gradually becomes abnormal, the stranger wearing white clothes gradually increases, Chen no longer stops, leads the community members to the garbage disposal center.
"Mr. White, are those in white dresses also school teachers? How have I never seen them? And why are they after us?"
"They're not teachers, they're the administrators who keep the order in the West, and the reason they've been chasing us...
Chen will lay a lost king on the grass, "because of him, and for you."
"We?"
"Yes, this school is not as simple as you think. If it's more like a human brain, the West is the place where the good emotions are handled, and the negative emotions and the garbage are handled by the East."
Chen uses a common metaphor to explain: "The West School District has only good memories, and all the garbage is sent to the East School District, but how can people have only good memories?"
"So we forgot a lot of memories?" Zhang is very smart, Chen has not finished, he has understood Chen's meaning.
"Yes, your memories are filled with despair. These things are seen as garbage by the West, and once your memories are relaxed or awakened, they will send them to the East."
"You know the truth, now you are willing to continue to look for your memory," Chen said very seriously.
"I will."
Zhong agreed without hesitation: "It's so hard to remember something that happened, and I'm going to go crazy, and I'd rather remember it all."
"I'd like to know what I've lost, what I've missed, what I've missed, what I've missed, what I've missed, what I've missed, what I've missed, what I've missed, what I've missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't
Like a monster.
Touch the scars of the torch finger, the eyes complex, do not know what to think.
"You're really crazy," said Zhou, like a caged rat, walking back and forth on the ground.
"No rejection," he said.
Chen raised the King of the ground: "In fact, there is a good thing about going to the Eastern School District now, that our people want to send us to the Eastern School District, but they don't think we've gone to the Eastern School District.
What's the difference?
"Let's go past ourselves and still look like people, and if they catch up and pass on, then you're afraid of forgetting more.
"The East School District is not as scary as you think," she said, "but if you're careful, it won't happen.
On the back of Wang, Chen opened the door of the garbage disposal center of the West school district, the house is clean, completely different from the side of the East school district.
"Don't disturb anything here, nor near the doors of the garbage collection."
Chen did not know if there were any managers at the waste disposal center in the West. He gave the students some rope in advance: "There is a small window on the second floor, wait for me to climb from the window to the wall, you see what I do, just follow me.
What about the king?
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wang is short and thin, not too heavy, and this is good news for Chen.
"Be careful, when you get to the second floor, immediately do as I say, and do it quickly! " After distributing the rope, Chen Gao himself bound the king one city, and another rope tied to himself and the king one city, and then back to him to the second floor.
After being sure there was nobody on the second floor, Chen didn't look at it, and ran straight to the window.
Opening the little window, Chen, very skillfully, stepped on the window stand and climbed onto the wall.
A rope was tied to the king's city.
"Is Mr. White teaching sports?"The first response came from the torch, raising the King and sending it out the window.
This is the second floor! Be careful.
Zhong and Zhou also began to help, the three together handed out the king a city.
After a lot of effort, Chen finally got the king on the wall, he is one of the keys tonight, Chen Chen will never lose him.
Once again sitting on the wall, Chen's mood is completely different from before.
He took off his rope, and laid down on the wall and moved to give the other students a place.
Hurry up!
Chen, with the help of the King, found several brick gaps on the wall and tied the rope to it.
The next time you want to go from East to West, you don't have to go through the garbage disposal center, use the rope he left.
It took tens of minutes before and after to jump into the Eastern School District, for the students of the Western School District, the Eastern School District is a completely strange scene.
Chapter 811 Memories of the Torch
The next day, the teacher was chased, turned the wall, it is completely different from the college life I imagined!
There may be more than you can imagine.
Chen grabbed some of the rope that was tied to the wall, and hid it behind the climbing tiger, even if someone passed by, did not find it.
This rope is my back.
Chen was a man when he left the Eastern School District, and when he came back, he became the head of a society.
Teacher, have you found anything that is not right?
Zhang stood straight, his eyes slowly opened in the scar.
What happened?
"Maybe I'm more sensitive, feeling the air on this side of the wall is more viscous, moist, and smells like blood.
He opened his mouth slowly, licked the scars of his upper lip, and his eyes were filled with confusion and doubt: This is more familiar to me than the West Campus.
"Are you kidding?Are you familiar with the breath of blood?"
"I'm not kidding, it's true.
Zhang looked at Chen, standing at the ground, face with smile.
"You don't feel wrong, here is the soil of the dream, in the world behind the door, only with dead bodies and blood as fertilizers, can open the stunning flowers.
Chen, back to the king, indicated that the torch was behind him: "I will take you to a place first, be careful, do not make too big a sound."
Their best camouflage was the night as they walked through the unmanageable bushes.
There was no danger, Chen took the torch to the place where the ghost of the tree.
Can you see here? Chen pointed to the hole where the ghost's head was hidden, and the trees surrounding it.
"We seem to have come...
Isn't that's where the girl was killed?We've seen it in the West!How can it be that there's a similar scene in the East?
"The killing scene in West is just an empty shell, and the bodies and the souls of the dead are hidden in East West, and what you see is the real killing scene.
As Chen said these words, Zhang torch seemed to be attracted by something, he stood alone by the tree hole, his shoulders shivering slightly.
"The Torch?"
He didn't seem to hear Chen's voice, squatted slowly, kneeling beside the hole, his hands trembling into the hole.
"Hey! What are you doing? I remember the girl's head being found in the hole! What are you doing with your hand stretched in?"
Zhou tried to pull the torch, but was stopped by Chen: "Don't disturb him, there is his memory in the hole, lost things to dig out yourself."
"Extract? You're really crazy! """None of Chen's powers,""I can't get out of here,""I can't stand and watch.
On his knees, the torch lay beside the hole, his eyes fixed on the dark hole, his arms slightly out of the hole.
His body was shaking, sweating on the scars of his face, like sliding tears.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
His fingers grasped the dirt and the roots, and his nails began to bleed, but the torch did not feel pain, and his expression was terrifying, and he went mad to dig the bottom of the hole.
"Zhang Torch, are you looking for this thing?" Chen took out from his backpack a rusty knife, the knife that was the trust of the Tree Cage ghost, the dark shadow swallowed the ghost and found it deep in the Tree Cage (see chapter 787), at the very beginning Chen Chen wanted to take a knife to protect himself, did not think too much.
All four weeks were suddenly quiet, and all eyes were focused on the cutlery.
"I found this knife in the tree, and the soul of the dead has trusted in it."
Chen put the knife in front of the torch: "Take it, can you remember your past?"
Zhang was about to collapse, his arms were shaking more and more, his pupils were jumping more and more.
Have you seen this knife somewhere else?Whose hand was this knife in?Whose neck was this knife cut in? Chen's words stuck like a nail to the torch's brain. He shivered his hand toward the knife, and when he touched the handle with his finger, his face suddenly changed, his pupils shrinked, his mouth grew, as if he had touched a burned iron.
Before the torch shouted, Chen had covered the torch's mouth a step ahead: "It's okay, those things are gone, just your past."
Chen's eyes closely on the torch's hand, and when the other hand has a stroke, he will immediately hold it down.
Zhang's strength is much bigger than Chen's imagination, and as the memory is relaxed, his strength is growing, the child should not be ordinary wicked.
Just as Chen was about to get out of control of the torch, the other side finally calm down.
Chen opened his hand, and the torch fell directly on the ground, his lips attached to the earth, the scars on his face appeared sharp.
"I-I've got some things in mind," said Zhang, staring at his shattered nails. "It was the schoolmaster's birthday," said Zhang. "There was a girl who wanted to be with the schoolmaster, but the schoolmaster had her own girlfriend, so he asked me to reject her instead.
I didn't see the girl, I waited, then I heard the silence in the woods, I went quietly, and I saw someone with this knife..."
"The girl is still struggling, but I don't dare go out.
I wasted. I've never seen so much blood before.
Nails dug into the dirt and the scars on the torch's face were squeezed together: "If I stood up then maybe the girl wouldn't have died.
When I went back and called the police, the men had fled, and I didn't know if they had been caught, but I saw one of them very well.
"The next night, we drank a lot, then we sang, and then there was a fire, and I was taken to the hospital, and so on...
"What's going on? Why don't I remember?"
"The burn was taken to the hospital, and your memory stayed here."
Chen has already known that the torch has passed.
Chapter 812 Image of a Doctor
"I could see the fire spreading, burning faster and faster, and the smoke was rolling, and there were screams and cries everywhere, and I didn't open my eyes, and I wanted to run out, but as soon as I opened the door, the flame went straight into the closet.
The torch lay on the ground, and a blue line came out of his forehead, and the scar on his face trembled softly: I didn't know where the pain came from first, and I fought hard to get out, and I could barely breathe, and my eyes could barely see, and I finally fainted in the hallway.
"I felt as though someone had lifted me, and I remained conscious at that time.
I should have been sent to the hospital, I could have heard the parents and the doctor, I wanted to open my eyes, but when I opened my eyes, I saw a completely dark world, as if everything had been baked.
Zhang's voice began to return to normal, and he was paralyzed: "I can remember my parents' faces, I can remember my doctors and nurses, but I can't remember how I woke up from my coma, or how I came to this school.
"There is no such possibility," said Chen, "but you have never been awakened, and this is the world where you are lost."
Didn't I wake up? Here's the world after I lost my mind?
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
Zhu feels like he is the only normal person in the society, the weapon is still carrying himself more safe.
"What Zhang said was not entirely unreasonable, but he did say something wrong.
The world is not his one dream, but gathers many people's negative emotions and despair experiences, and finally forms a nightmare.
Chen looked over the faces of all members of the society: "You are all trapped in this world, and this world is made by you.
After Chen had finished, the forest was very quiet, everyone looked at him, the face was very wonderful.
"I know you may not be able to accept for the time being, but it doesn't matter, we have time."
Chen, behind Wang, looked at the wall far away: "Wang Wang memories wake up and bring the administrator, now the torch your memories also begin to relax, the administrator is very likely to come, we must leave as soon as soon as he said.
Chen turned around and walked out to the wood.
"Wait!"
Zhang with his hands grasped the red earth, slowly lifted his head, eyes tightly fixed on Chen: "Who are you? Why tell us these?
It doesn't matter who I am, but it matters that I can help you get out of here. In reality, your relatives have been waiting for too long.
Chen smiled, "In fact, I'm very like you, and I've lost some of my childhood memories, so when I meet you, I seem to have seen myself once.
With a call, Chan walked away: "I am your lucky, I was not guided at first, a man searching in the darkness, lost too much..."
Chen was so moved that he led the members of the association away from the experimental building and the staff apartment building, and along the small road to the next to the teaching building.
"The toilet on the top of the teaching building," I said. "The answer I want should be here."
The classroom in the west is quiet, but the classroom in the east is strange, and as soon as you get close, a cold will creep on your back, hitting your brain.
"Be quiet. If something happens here, the consequences will be very serious.
Chen singing.
What's going to happen? Zhou's forehead sweated, and he grabbed the knife he had taken from the tree hole, ripped his back, looked around, and looked very nervous.
"How do we deal with garbage in our everyday lives," Chen said with a smile, but the words made several members of the society breathe. "When we are caught, we will be separated from the goods, and we will be thrown away directly after we have exhausted all the values.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
I don't know if it's a mistake, the night in the East is more dark than in the West.
Step on the broken stairs, the stair hand left burned marks, beside the empty classroom could hear silently the sound of the chair moving.
"It's a scary place. I can't imagine it being separated from us.
Zhuang lowered his voice and walked to the end of the line.
"No," he said.
Zhou, holding the knife tightly behind the torch, fearing that face full of scars students suddenly fall sick to hurt themselves.
The more you worry about something, the more accidents will happen, and Zhou has been staring at the torch, and the other side walks and suddenly stops.
What's the matter?
All right, I'm curious, why are so many pictures of doctors on the corridor of the teaching building?The torch looked up at the doctor on the wall.
Yes, have you noticed that's all a doctor's work photo.
Zhang's words attracted Chen's attention. He had previously felt the pictures of the doctors strange, but he couldn't find the reason, and at this time, said Zhang, he suddenly thought of a possibility.
"The world behind the door is made up of the memory of the doorman, the school is very special, containing the memory of all the students, and the doctor's photos on the wall may be the people the students have actually met.
Chen touched the torch's shoulder gently: "Look at these pictures and see if there are any doctors you know.
Doctors who can be put on the wall are the top of the industry, how can I know?
"Here, doctors may have some special meaning. Just do as I say.
Chen, as he led the members of the group to the floor, as he passed through the third floor, stopped abruptly: "Do not move, there is someone in front.
The classroom on the third floor near the corridor had no locks, and the poor quality wooden door was blown with the wind.
Chen They stood still in the hallway, and after a long time, there was a dark way out of the classroom.
"This body is a little familiar, is it often isolated?
Chapter 813 Do you dare?
Black and often solitary, but agile, not like an almost blind person.
Chen didn't dare to go out, and he wanted to continue to watch for a while, but the other man ran directly to the other side of the corridor, seeming to be looking for something.
Is It Always Alone? Is His Eye Restoring?
The classroom is dark, even Chen has dark eyes, still walks careful.
Teacher, is that your acquaintance?
"Do more than do less. Let's go to the top."
Chen looked at the dark, the other did not leave, but entered another classroom.
There were others in the middle of the night, the variable increased, and Chen didn't know whether it was good or bad.
Several people come to the fourth floor, the toilet on the other side of the corridor, need to pass through the long corridor.
Don't answer, Don't get out of the line, don't you understand? Chen instructed the members, and went into the corridor behind the King.
He lowered his body and looked at the two sides of the classroom with the extra light of his eyes.
The windows were painted black, and nothing was seen.
The members followed by Chen, they tried to control themselves not to look at both sides, but the more heart told themselves not to look at random, the more uncontrolled eyes looked at the other.
What is that?
The classroom seems to haven't been cleaned for a long time. As Zhou passes through a window, he sees a line of hair-like things beneath the window, and it feels like a girl is lying on the window of the classroom.
Wouldn't it be a personality? He stood up, his head slightly tilted, and looked down at the window of the classroom.
"The hair... is moving?"
Until Zhou had a clear view, his body suddenly hit something, suddenly prevented, he didn't hold the steady hand knife, the rust knife fell on the ground.
The rusted knife and brick collided with a slight sound, which was heard in the late-night lecture hall.
Everyone stopped and Chen looked at Zhou.What are you doing?
"I accidentally hit the torch," said Zhou, covering his nose, and pointing at the torch which was still there, he found the torch's expression a little strange: "You are going well, how did you suddenly stop?"
"The Torch?"
No matter how the others cried, the torch did not respond, he stared at the pictures on the wall, with a calm look of sadness.
When he saw the knife that killed the girl in the trees, he collapsed, and now he is completely different from before.
There was no mad scream, no self-indulgence to relieve the mental pain, he just stood quietly in front of the photograph.
"This doctor...I've seen him.
His voice was so small that only those around him could hear.
"That fire burned one fifth of my skin, and I watched the flesh burn, and I smelled the smell of my own body, until my eyes melted, and my skin was stuck together, and my world became dark.
"I was sent to the hospital because it hurts so much that I don't feel the pain.
The eyes were not opened, the nose was burned, one ear was two-thirds, and one ear was one-third.
"I've become a monster, I can't see myself, but I know I'm not anymore, and I can't go back and live as an individual.
Have you ever tried to hear your family's voices with two-thirds of your ears?
Someone is saving me,,I am getting closer and closer to being alive, but how am I going to wake up?
"I can't feel the light," "I have only a shadow in the world that my right eye sees," "do you say," "do I still have to live?" The torchman pressed on the photograph of the wall, and his face was bleeding, and a tiny thread of blood emerged from beneath his skin, as if it were a needle for surgery.
"This doctor I know, who accompanied me for a week, who was to take away my life, and who was to bet with him. " His voice grew dull, and the torch's throat seemed to have been burned by fire, and his appearance gradually changed.
Scars and scars spread over his face, his ears began to dry like flowers, and his left eye gradually melted.
"I didn't say a word to him, but I was impressed by him, and at the last moment of my life, he was one of my three.
Their guilt unlocked the torch's memories, the doctor who had rescued them made clear their blurred memories, the fragments of their minds fused together, and a thread of blood poured out of his skin, as if the healed scar were breaking again.
His coat was getting a little red.If you were like me, would you choose to live or die?
"Are you wearing a half-dress?Are you going to get back to what you were like?Are you going to get back to what you were like?Are you going to get back to what you were like?Are you going to get back to what you were like?"
Zhou could not even pick up a knife, grabbed Zhulong's arm, the two unconsciously retreated to three meters.
No one answered, and Zhang's eyes slowly moved away from the photograph, and he looked at Chen-I thought I was who, now can you tell me who you are?
The two stood on the dark corridor, looking at each other.
You asked me, and I gave you the answer.
Chen, standing on the ground, did not step back: "We are the same, I want to find my forgotten memories, to help you are to help myself.
You're lying! Zhang reached out to Chen, but when his finger was about to touch Chen, he stopped again.
Why stop? Chen took a step forward, and approached the torch's face of despair. Are you afraid that after I have been killed, another will I stand up from the body? Are you afraid of me in red?
His hands grasped the torch's shoulder, Chen's face was insane, his hands moved on the torch's shoulder, finally slowly raised the torch's face, touched the other's forehead gently.
Kill me?
Not only Zhang, but also Zhou and Zhulong, who were hiding behind.
There was noise in the corridor, and after a long time, Chen opened the torch, and he looked at the other members of the group:
"I just want to find the memory I lost, and you help me, and you help yourself, and it's the same.
Chapter 814 Moveable Doors
Zhang has long discovered Chen is not ordinary, the eyes can keep quiet no matter what see, as if nothing in the world can surprise him.
Frankly, he was very afraid of people like this, but it was because he was afraid that he chose to listen and follow.
Standing in front of the photo, the torch opened the only left eye, he silently looked at Chen's face.
The ordinary five of the mixed with the face of not found, but it is such a person, just inadvertently exposed even the face of fear.
It's hard to describe it as if a grievous ghost and a deformed madman were combined, and from that face you could see madness, sickness, cruelty, but you couldn't see fear and fear alone.
Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, we should be one."
He believed Chen's words, because that expression only someone who has lived through hell possessed, and the other, like himself, forgot the past.
"I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I remembered some very unpleasant memories, so I lost control.
Zhang's voice was hard to hear, but his attitude was much better.
All right, how can a teacher really blame a student? Chen, with a smile on his face, feels very good, very gentle, and it is hard to believe that he is the one who just spoke to Zhang Tor.
It's nothing, it's just some painful memories.
The wounds of the torch were still pouring out, and his clothes were a little red: I remembered myself as a witness to the murder, as a coward; I remembered the feeling of burning skin, like a needle in the flesh, until I felt no pain; I remembered myself lying in a sterile hospital, struggling, desperate to grow, I didn't want to die, but I didn't know how to live.
There was something special happening to you or around you at the last stage of your life. The torch appeared in the world inside the door, but at that time he had lost the ability to open the door. Chen was curious about how he had entered the school, and only knew how to enter it could have been a chance of finding his way out.
Within the Samsung scene, the "gate" is the only entrance, but the four-star scene seems to be somewhat different.
"The End of Life"
The Torch reached out and touched her face: "I seem to be in a coma, but I can feel the outside, and I do not know the reality and the nightmares, but I do remember one thing, that at the end of the night, a door appears in the hospital.
"The door?"
"I've been in the hospital for seven days, and that door comes up every night, and it gets closer and closer to me, until it finally runs to my bed."
I could not seek help. On the eighth night, the door was pushed out of it, and one hand stretched out the door seat, and dragged me into it.
The Torch describes the case of the often solitary, they all meet a "gate" that moves itself, and every morning at midnight, the door slowly approaches the sleeping person, and finally stands by the bed, pushing the door from the inside, taking the living person to the bed.
Chen was more curious about what happened behind the door, and he wanted to know about the process of losing the memory of the student who was destroyed in the fire, and how he gradually became a half-dresser.
The Torch shook his head.I had a dream, a dream that was so real, that in the dream they all called me Lin, and I told them repeatedly that I called the Torch, and they recognized the wrong person, but they thought I was joking.
"No one believes me. I can only live in my dreams by the name of Lin Lin, and experience all that Lin Lin has encountered, for a long time, and even myself began to doubt whether I really was called Lin Lin
Being bullied,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have no friends, the world hates me, mental and physical torment slowly makes me sick, until one day, a girl enters my dream.
It was a rainy day, and a frog was stuck in the bookshelf of the same table, and she doubted that I had done it, but how could I do such a boring thing?
No one listened to my defence, my classmates drove me out of the classroom, everyone in the corridor looked at me with a different look, and I had to escape alone to the stage of the classroom.
There, I met her.
Even if I knew it was a dream, I still felt that girl was special.
Zhang's voice changed: "She's the only one who doesn't ignore me."
"I've spoken to her grief," she said.
Then I told her about my past and told her I wasn't really Lin.
"She's interested in what I'm talking about, and I love being with her, because only when I'm with her can I not forget myself, not be assimilated by that dream.
"We meet every evening on the stage, and I slowly feel like I can't go without her.
Just as I was feeling more and more colorful, she suddenly asked me a question-do you want to see the scenery outside the school?
"I didn't understand the meaning of the question at the time, but thought about being with her, so I nodded.
That night, after midnight, she took me to the library.
The door of the school library was locked. We turned the window into it and found a mirror behind a bookshelf on the third floor.
"The mirror is big and the girl says it can be used several times, so let me not tell anyone.
"I believe in her," she said, "and I remembered that was the first time I saw a mirror in my dream!"
I asked the girl what I should do
The girl just said let me look quietly in the mirror.
"I stood in front of the mirror, and she hid behind me, and on a dead night, I looked at myself in the mirror.
"The more I see the people in the mirror don't look like me, the more I start bleeding in the mirror, and a scar appears on the face of the people in the mirror.
His ears dried, his left eyes closed, and his face was blurred with blood!
I couldn't keep looking down, but when I wanted to leave, the monster in the mirror caught me!
"The blood flows through the mirror until it is red!"
"I cried out to save, turned my head to see Zheng Wen, but she was silent, and I still remember the last word she said to me-"Why are you afraid?
Her delicate fingers gently touched my left eye and slowly took out my left eye!
"The world lost its colour," "I was dragged away by the monsters in the mirror," "all the wonderful expectations," "in that moment all became the most wicked curse."
Chapter 815 It's just a guess
She took off my left eye, and I was like the monster in the mirror.
"She shattered all my illusions," "I was not Lin," "I was the torch," "I was the monster in the mirror."
The wound washed with blood, and the torch's outer garments were mostly red, and more terrifying was the twisting of the blood on his clothes.
At first, Chen thought the torch was a half-dress, but soon he found himself looking at the other, as the memory was constantly awakened, the blood on the torch more and more, almost to dye the whole body.
"I was dragged into the mirror, and I looked at her standing outside the mirror, and she held my left eye, her lips open, and she seemed to be saying-one more.
My left eye slowly changed in her hands, my memory of this life flashed in the eyes, when she took away my left eye, also took away all my goodness and hope.
dri dri.
The blood dropped on the corridor, and there was a foot in the teaching hall, but no one came, no matter what direction looked.
"What is the world behind the mirror?" Chen asked softly.
Red, there is only red, everything is red.
Zhang's description reminded Chen of the scene after the Samsung test mission: "So how did you come back from?
"There was another me in the mirror, who was full of blood, who wanted to eat me, and I could not think more than to flee.
After a long run, I found behind the mirror the same school, empty, at least on the surface looks like this.
Then what?
"I didn't last the first night, and I was finally caught by the other one behind the mirror.
There was more confusion in Zhang's eyes: "He killed me in memory, but when I opened my eyes again, I returned to this school, and lost most of my memory, and became a member of this school."
That means your memories were altered after you died?
"Well, I don't know what happened in the middle," he said. "You want to know the answer, and you're going to look for the bloody red world in the mirror."
Zhang shouldn't have lied. He looks terrible, but his expression is very serious.
"I probably understand.
Chen said softly: normally the 'gate' is the only way into the bloody world, but in this scene there is a ghost beyond our imagination, he may be on top of the red coat, this guy using the mirror, separately in the other scene in the bloody, can you understand
All the members who were there shook their heads.
"In a simple example, push this door, we enter the world of red blood.
In this red world we found another mirror, and when we touch the mirror, we enter the world inside the mirror.
"If you compare it with dreaming, it should be well understood.
Normal people live in reality, after sleep dream, our thoughts appear in the dream world, but what happens if we dream in the dream world? Our consciousness appears in the dream.
"The red world is composed of despair and negative emotions, and the world behind the mirror is more like a "dream" created by the doorman himself.
Chen didn't spend much effort on explaining to the students, but he did think through a very important question.
When he woke up, he lost contact with all the employees, and the black cell phone was not around, which made his situation very dangerous.
He hasn't been able to understand how the master of the school did?
Not to say black cell phone, but in his shadow, but at this moment, his shadow becomes very normal, Zhang Ya is not inside.
It can be seen from this that I didn't really enter the school.
Just like the torch said, when he looks in the mirror, there is another him.
A gentle, A cruel, These two together are true him.
"I should have the same problem as the torch, some personality inside the mirror, some personality outside the mirror.
All this is Chen's guess, and cannot be guaranteed to be absolutely correct, he is like walking in the fog, at this time the only light in the world is himself.
"The mirrors we used were in the library. "The next thing is to go to the library after finishing the toilet.
Chen expressed his thoughts.
There is nowhere people can't escape, why do you want to go back? Chen couldn't understand, his memories were just awakening, all kinds of memories were floating in his mind, his eyes were a little lost.
"I like the red world more than here, because it's more real than here.
From Chen's words can be heard that he is not ordinary, Zhang Tor thought thought no objection: Exactly, I also want to know what happened to me in the end, is it not reasonable that I should die?
After receiving Zhang's positive response, Chen's expression was more relaxed, and he had a good helper.
Go and see the toilet first.
Chen They've been in the corridor for a long time, but fortunately nothing unusual happened in the classroom.
The blood dropped on the torch, accompanied by the sound of the dripping dripping, and all around could hear the gradual approach, but strangely, they only heard the footsteps, and did not see the people.
"Ju Long, have you seen the change on the torch? His face... too scary.
Zhou did not dare to approach Zhang torch and Chen, feeling that both of them are mad.
"Now, we can only believe that the change in the torch does not mean that he did not deceive us. We are looking for the lost memory.
Zhong's face wasn't too good, he bite his teeth, holding the fingers of the cell phone already white.
"All right," said Zhou, turning his head to look behind him. He was terrified and could not go back alone. "I'm really crazy to have joined such a group.
He wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No!
To be exact, those who turned were staring at the torch and the king on the back of Chen!
Zhu nearly fell to the ground, fortunately Zhulong helped him.
What's the matter?
There's someone behind! There's a lot of people behind us!
Where is it? Looking back, there were only a few of them in the vacant hallway.Are you deluded?
CHAPTER 816 A Boy Without A Face
Zhuang dragged Zhu, the two looked behind, around a dark, could hear the footsteps, but did not see the living.
Who is there?
"I saw them all standing behind us, as if they were living in a world that revolves around us.
"They've been staring at the torch and the city of Wang. We shouldn't say anything to the white teacher.
"It's good," said Zhu. "It's not like you're lying," Zhu said.
The sooner Chen and Zhang Torch had reached the middle of the corridor, the closer to the toilet, the more nervous they were.
"Mr. White, just when Zhou saw someone following us, they all stood up, and I don't know what to say.
Zhong dragged Zhou to Chen.
"When I lowered my head to pick up the cutlery, I saw that behind us were all men, their heads down, floating in the air.
No,they're like walking on a ceiling,they're supposed to be attracted to the torch and to the kingdom,I've seen with my own eyes,they've been staring at the torch and the kingdom.
Zhu didn't want to get close to the torch, which is a kind of instinctive disgust.
Standing People Chen has seen those people in the laboratory: Go to the bathroom first and see if there are 'doors'. If there are no crops in the toilet, we will leave immediately.
This school is too tricky to give Chen a sense of security even with a red coat.
When Chen was only a few steps away from the toilet, his neck was suddenly held by a hand.
Two cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King
Don't go in.
Wang's voice was very different from his usual, with a strong sense of repentance, it felt like a worn-out tramp dog, trying to protect his companion's body, and then being beaten by others.
Who are they?
Classmates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Wang tried to squeeze a smile, but could not.
"Have you fooled this child?What are you talking about?" Zhulong, carrying a pink cell phone, quietly approached Chen, the atmosphere in the classroom was too depressing, to be able to feel a little comfort only with Chen.
King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King
"They let me get you in, I didn't promise, they beat me, they let me climb the stairs, I heard them, but they weren't ready to let you go.
Remember, no matter who takes you to the top of the classroom, you're not going! Don't go!
"Are they looking for someone else to deceive Lin?"
"I don't know, but I've told the teacher, why doesn't he come?" Wang was a little anxious, and the only life-saving straw in his heart was the teacher, but the teacher didn't seem to have come, and perhaps the teacher hated Lin thought too.
"It's all right. I'll just go and see it.
Don't Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go
It is not possible to give up Chen, and now with the torch help, this is still strong half-dress is one of Chen's wars.
Wang's arms grew more and more powerful, and his arms were stretched out, and the child was desperate to stop Chen from entering, and should not have seen the tragedy reappear before his eyes.
The toilet on the top of the classroom is at the bottom of the corridor, the air here is spreading a nasal disinfection smell, the wall brick can see yellow brown stains, the ground leaves stains, and each shoe print.
Those shoe prints come from different people, many.
The door of the toilet is locked, Chen take out the tool force it to open.
As Chen pushed the door of the toilet, he took a step back, he looked carefully inside the toilet.
The toilet in the east seems to be completely different from the one in the west, very dirty and messed up, as if the place had been forgotten by the school, had never been cleaned, and had never been entered by anyone.
Has therm been locked since Lin thought of it? Chen returned to ask Wang, the child was not able to speak at this time, his body trembling as if he had been sick.
Compared to the West School District, this toilet makes Chen's feeling more real, he entered it with a king's back.
As soon as he stepped into the toilet, Wang shut his eyes, he did not dare to see, even to remember.
This room doesn't feel like any other.
The Torch looked around, and the walls were filled with things like blood, like cracks all over the toilet.
Those faces painted on the walls were blurred, as if to be forgotten memories.
Those dry threads climbed all over the walls, wrapped them up, seemingly unwilling to see them again.
Going to the first door, Chen took out Lin's cell phone stretched into the gap, the screen had several shadows moving.
Who's inside?
Chen opened the shutter door, the scene before him exceeded his expectation.
There was a model in the first compartment, and he was wearing a pair of black leather shoes, probably between the ages of thirty and forty, and he looked like the white teacher Chen had seen before.
"Why is there such a difference between a pair of shoes placed in the toilet in the West and a pair of shoes placed in the first space in the East?"
The little white teacher in the room, with her hands behind her head, standing upright, as if he had made a mistake.
Chen didn't see any problems using his dark eyes, and finally he took out Lin's cell phone to shoot the first interval.
He was surprised by the display on the screen.
There was a picture of a faceless boy holding his hands behind his head and doing the same thing as a white teacher.
"Isn't this faceless boy Linus? Did Mr. White punish him in this way, so he punished him in the same way?"
CHAPTER 817 Will You Be My Friend
Chen pushed out the second compartment, which contained a thin male doll, who had a deformed foot, curled in the compartment, and threw mud and garbage around.
"It's like a king."
The second space doll and the King on the back of the song wear blue sports shoes, this doll should be the designation of the King.
Chen picked up his cell phone to shoot at the second interval, the screen is touching.
The faceless boy was forced into the toilet, where people threw all kinds of garbage on him.
The boy on the screen does not resist, let alone deceive.
The Puppet in the third room, wearing glasses, washed with red paint, stood by the wall of the toilet.
The character is somewhat similar to the tall thin boy Chen saw in 413 dormitory.
With previous experience, Chen directly uses the cell phone to close the gap.
There appeared on the screen a boy without five, he stands alone in the toilet, and people around him constantly spray paint in the toilet.
His clean clothes were dirty and painted down the corner of his clothes.
The boy lowered his head and said nothing.
"These bullies are out of control." Chen pushed the door of the fourth compartment, where the puppets were not dressed, and the clothes were wet and thrown to the side of the crater.
Chen took out his cell phone to shoot in the fourth interval, the faceless boy in the picture slowly take off the coat full of paint, someone dropped a bottle of water on him.
The Fifth, The Sixth...
Each of the screens is astonishing, when people go into madness, they do not know how bad their behavior is, they unreservedly spread all the negative emotions to one person.
When he opened the first compartment, Chen just wanted to find the truth, everything here had nothing to do with, he was just a passerby, a victim who wanted to get out.
But after six consecutive intervals, there was a change in his heart, and his face was dark, and it would have been surprising if anyone who knew him had seen it, because this man rarely showed such an expression.
Changing expression is the change of inner emotion, revealed on the face, the inner thoughts will be exposed, the weaknesses will be found, so Chen, when carrying out the task of the black cell phone, always remain calm.
"Is this child?
Lifting his head, Chen looked at the seventh chamber, which was the only chamber without a puppet, and also the only chamber without a door.
The ax of the door was violently destroyed, the connection was rarely seen breaking wood, the door of the seventh interval was knocked out.
The doors flying, The inside of the chamber is filled with stuff like the seeds, precisely the seeds in the toilet are actually climbed out of the chamber, the seventh chamber is the source of all the seeds.
"Is Lins originally locked up in this room?
The black threads like dead climbing tiger, they climbed the walls of the separation, seeming to hide something.
Chen took out Lin's cell phone, he adjusted the brightness of the screen to the brightest, and then shot at the interval.
The faceless boy with his coat and trousers, the sewage and the paint flowing down his body, six colours, like a monster with claws dancing on his body.
The bathroom door on the screen seemed to have been covered with something from outside, the boy lowered his head, held his clothes, and hit the board for a moment.
He didn't have a face, couldn't see his face, couldn't hear his voice, didn't know if he was crying or calling for help.
Chen only saw the child constantly knocking on the door until he knocked on the door.
He stood with his feet at the door of the ward, covered himself with his painted and dirty trousers, his hands hanging down, his arm which had just hit the door had been broken by pieces of wood, the blood was running on his arm, and the paint was pouring into his wound.
He wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The boy stood at the door for a long time. He slowly raised his hand and put on one of the wet clothes.
He had no injuries except for his arm, but his body was shaking with pain.
The pants were cut in between, and there was a big hole behind the clothes, and the boy was wearing all the clothes, and the ground was filled with the stain of an unbearable monster.
He wiped his face and tried to walk to the door of the toilet.
The corridor lighted into the toilet, the exit was bright enough to illuminate the boy's appearance at the moment, bright enough to leave him nowhere to escape.
The steps back, he dressed in dirty clothes, again in the seventh compartment.
leaning against the wall of the toilet, the boy's body slowly sliding, he curled in the corner, the face of the not-five-man at the door of the toilet, he seemed to wait for the light to go out.
The screen did not end there, the child looked for a long time, then raised his head.
There were no five faces to Chen, he seemed to know that someone was looking at him.
Would you like to be a friend with me
Chen's ears sounded like this, and he heard it very clearly, but when he looked at the direction of the sound, there was nothing.
"From your cell phone? "It's impossible."
The shot was in the last scene, the face of the faceless boy crouched in the corner of the room, the face of Chen, as if waiting for Chen's answer.
"I'd like to be friends with you, even though you sound like a curse.
Chen didn't care about the curse, his life was changed from a cursed love letter, without that love letter, when he did the first task, he was cut into pieces.
Chen agreed, but the boy on the screen still kept the move.
Move the cell phone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can You hear me? Chen tried to communicate with the other person, without any effect, he waited a long time, the screen of the mobile phone changed again.
The door of the seventh compartment was pushed out and a red hand stretched in.
The hand grasped the faced boy, as if he had said something to the boy, the faceless boy nodded gently.
Afterwards the faceless boy was taken by the hand, went to the other side of the "gate" disappeared.
What did he say to the boy? Chen thought suddenly of the word he had just heard: What did the master of the hand say to the faceless boy--would you like to be my friend?
The faceless boy promised, and then he disappeared?
Chen carefully combed.
The faceless boy is Lins, he does not push the door, but the blood hand is stretched out from inside the door, which means that there was a door in the toilet.
The Master sent an invitation to Linth, finally Linth agreed to the other, so thought, that the only bloodman is the doorman.
Chapter 818 I am not necessarily enemy to him
It was a great step forward for Chen to find the true master of the school, even though he only saw one hand of the other.
"I just heard someone ask me-"Will you be my friend?"
"This is not from my cell phone. I hear it very clearly from my ear.
He probably didn't say this to Lin, but to me.
Chen looked back, and the red blood in the toilet, when did the big pieces begin to fall, like the fall leaves, completely lost life.
Did you promise him?
The King, who kept his eyes closed on his back, suddenly opened and put his head on Chen's shoulder, and his voice was very low, and he could not hear at all.
"Well, he looks very poor.
Chen's neck washed away by Wang, and the two bodies were tied together, and he felt that Wang's body temperature was falling.
'All his friends are dead!' ''''The'''The''''The''''The''''The'''''The'''''The'''''The'''''The'''''The'''''The''''The'''The'''The''The''The''The''The''The''The'The''The'The''The'The'The''The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'
That bright red look a bit sharp.
"You...
Chen had Wang cast off from his back, and the child's hands waved helplessly, grasping the air with force, and tears poured out from the close eyes: Did you remember anything?
Returning to his hometown, the memories of Wang were touched, and he had never opened his eyes, but had heard Chen's words, and realized what had happened.
You have promised that man will come and find you wherever you go! King's voice changed greatly, and he fell into a frenzy, completely different from the timidity that he showed at first.
"He doesn't come to me, I'll go to him. I like to make friends, in all sorts of ways.
Chen has many friends, but they are not around, so he also wants to know some new friends.
The blood flowing from Wang's eyes slipped from his cheeks, his coat was dyed red, the bright blood on his skin seemed to blossom like a flower, and this looked very weak boy, had the potential to become a red coat.
"I'm becoming more and more interested in the master of the school and how he got all of you into the door.
Chen didn't expect to find a few members of the society, each not simple, which is of course a component of luck, but also in another way explains school's terrible.
A Half Red Dress is enough to a normal two-star scene, and in the school of ghosts is the existence of a red coat and a suspected red coat, Chen has seen several.
Are your constant jokes hiding your inner panic?
Hearing Wang's words, Chen was even more sure that the other party had recovered memories, the former Wang Wang was timid, never to raise objections, only a taste of obedience.
"I'm not kidding, I'm sure I've had hope, even if it's been crushed.
I wanted to help him, to be his friend is only the first step.
"Have you noticed that most of the children in this school have a deformed childhood, or have a deformed body, or have a deformed personality because of some external factors, and they all have a hard time remembering themselves," Chen said.
What do you want to say
"I'm curious what the owner of the school has experienced before, as a doorman, what experience has made him open this 'door'?
Promise to be his friend will always be left, the school was not so big, and the constant despair and pain of joining it made it what it is now.
After Wang said this, the eyes stopped leaking blood, but the body still shaking.
"It looks like you know a lot.
Chen felt like the school and its own ghost house, only the ghost school is constantly looking for the desperate students, or to attract the desperate children, and Chen's ghost house is the visitors refused.
"What I can think of is, here, when I open my eyes.
I didn't have the torch, I died in this school, I live again here, I've forgotten a lot, I just know that this school is expanding.
"Why are you here? Isn't Lin's punishment for you?"
Wang stopped for a long time before he began: "I am the only one left by Linth, and I am here because after Linth's disappearance, I became his substitute.
The fear and anxiety of the students turned into violence occurred on me, one night when I was about to collapse, the door found me.
According to the torch, the door first appeared to be very far from where you were sleeping, and then gradually approached you every day...
"The King" wasted by the King.
"He's completely passive, and I'm active, and I want to find a corner that can hide, besides..."
Wang had a long hesitation to tell another secret: The hand that stretched out the door, painted with all kinds of paints, was the hand of Lin, and he invited me, and I wanted to say an apology to him in the face.
I actually reported to the teacher, but he didn't come.
What else do you know about Linus and the door?
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
You can let me down.
You're sure you're not lying? Chen put down Wang: At the toilet door of the West School District, as soon as your memory shifted, the school administrator immediately appeared, and in the end if I didn't make you faint, I'm afraid we'd been caught now, and your treatment is completely different from that of Zhang Tor and Zhu Long.
"Maybe because Lin is his friend, and I am Lin's friend."
Several people walked through seven separates, here recordings of what Lins had encountered, should have been captured only partly.
I can't imagine what the doorman had done before.
As he was about to get out of the toilet, Chen looked at the seventh compartment: "To make sure the door is in the seventh compartment, to know the owner of the school, you just need to investigate everything that happens in the school in the bathroom.
Based on the clues, Chen was then prepared to go to three places - the school archives, the school library, and the oil painting room promised by Zhou.
Chapter 819 They Come
The school's archives may contain information about the school's owner, the library may contain mirrors to the blood-red world, and the laboratory's oil painting room is where Chen has promised to go.
"Where do you want to go first?" Chen looked at the picture. "I know where the art house is, and I have seen the scenes you dreamed of, and now I can take you with me, but are you really ready to wake up your memories?"
Zhou didn't communicate much with Chen, was asked by Chen suddenly, some are confused.
Before returning to his memory, he had been wondering what he had forgotten, but he had been hesitant to see the final of the match between Zhang and Wang.
"Are you ready for the past? "The memory is not awakening, you are just an unimportant student in this school, you can do anything, repeating a peaceful and beautiful day.
Once you wake up, you will be tracked by the school administrator, and there will be no way back.
Chen always asked Zhou, also a test, among all the members of the society, Zhou is the most dominant.
"I think it's better to get back to the memory," he said. "I think it's better to get back to the memory.
Zhou's eyes turned to the torch and to the king: "I don't know how real I am, will I scare myself to cry?"
You'll have to think about it again. The torch was dull, and he twisted the burned face. There was a feeling on you that made me feel very uncomfortable.
Zhou shut up for a moment, not knowing how to answer, his eyes drifted, and his heart seemed to shake again.
"Let's go to the school's archives. "You have enough time to think.
Chen touched Zhou's shoulder gently: "Don't worry, I respect any of your choices."
"Thank you.
Zhou washed his head and touched Chen with the torch next to him: "The way he looks should be terrible. If he can wake up the memories, whatever we want to do next, it will be a little easier.
"Everyone has a choice. I'm not going to interfere.
"Are you helping us to recover from the past, to increase our strength, and then to help you achieve your goals?"
"I've seen such a thing in a book, that roses don't ask why, they don't ask for a return, they bloom just because they bloom.
I'm not so selfless, but at least I've been through the pains you've been through, and I've been reminded of myself by seeing you.
"There's one more thing I want to reiterate: our relationship is not mutual use, it's mutual gain, and mutual respect is the basis," Chen said.
Hearing Chen's voice, at one moment Li seemed to have forgotten, the man in sight was just an ordinary man.
Maybe he just didn't find his memory.
Zhang and Zhuang pointed, followed Chen's footsteps.
Wang's eyes opened with tears, seemed to more recognize Chen.
Walking the last week, if you think, eyes slowly become firm.
Back to the corridor, Chen hasn't gone out a few steps, very soft feels a little less.
There was a thick smell in the air, which he had heard in the laboratory.
A bad feeling came to the heart, the more forward Chen go, the more depressed, it is like walking on the bottom of the lake, cold from all sides.
"They've come back again?"
Chen didn't look down, things have happened, look down only disturbs his judgment, he needs to leave the teaching building as much as possible.
Standing with the torch, Chen's eyes shrinked and lowered their voices: Did you see the monsters in the corridor?
The Torch stared at the corridor, and his blood slipped through his coat.There seemed to be something, but they seemed not to hurt us.
When the torch saw his hair floating upward, it was as if an invisible baby had caught his hair in the darkness.
A trail of tiny wounds began to appear on the torch and the king city, which monsters were attracted to by the two.
"I can't see them, how did they hurt me?" The scars on the torch's face were continuing to bleed, and his blood was flowing, and his memory was awakening, but he hadn't learned how to use this power.
"We can see them just by turning our eyes, but I don't recommend that you do it.
"Why?
"Because you'll be more desperate when you see it."
Chen pointed out that the monsters attacked Zhang Torch and King's City without knowing it was by instinct, or by some, if the latter, it would be more trouble.
The smell was getting thicker and thicker and the wounds were getting heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier.
As soon as several people ran to the corner of the third floor, King could not stand, his steps became more and more helpless: "I felt that many things were tearing apart my body, and my memory became blurred again.
"Mr. White," said Zhou, "there seems to be more dirt downstairs," and as soon as they had reached the third floor, they smelled a nasty smell, stranger still, that came from around them.
Lower your head as if you were picking up a cutlery, and look from the bottom up to where the smell spreads around.
There was a twisted face between him and the king. The monster's coat was tightly attached to the flesh. It seemed to have no skin.
King, King, that thing is in front of you!
"I've told you don't look," "I don't see, I don't worry."
Chen directly back to Wang, one foot on the most smelly place, and then fly down to the floor.
Zhou covered his chest, where Chen just stepped was the monster's head: Okay, I know.
As they descended to the second floor, the smell filled the corridor, the memory of the loose Zhulong also became the target of the monsters attack.
Zhang was able to resist, but Zhulong and Wang could not keep up, only by Chen and Zhou to continue.
Chapter 8
Things were moving in a worse direction, and Zhou began to be caught by the monster, with the first wound on his finger.
What now, Mr. White?
Chen had no better way than to squeeze the teeth, and even if all of them were squeezed by the monster and lost their ability to act, he would bring them all out.
The smell came into his nostrils, and he was almost convulsed, and when Chen was about to approach the corner of the first floor, he had a burst of pain in his chest.
Chen almost fell to the ground.
He looked down, and was stabbed in his chest with a sharp nail.
"The curse of the 413 bedroom?" he realized at once, looking at his shadow.
The original shadow was twisting at this time, as if the "people" hiding inside were enduring great pain.
Even he was attacked?
All the members of the circle reached the limit, the scales, looking very scary.
"The exit is right here, don't stop!"
Chen's will is very strong, he is already accustomed to pain.
Take off your nails, Chen is trying to run forward, even more step, the distance will be closer to hope.

"I draw with the hand..."
It's been very difficult for Chen to bring one out, and more is not possible.
Their legs were filled with lead, and each step was heavier. The smell on the first floor was more intense than on the second, and there were more monsters waiting for them.
Everyone except Chen had despair, but here it was, the smell of the air suddenly faded, as if someone had taken away some monster.
"The chance!" Chen, pulling out of Zhou's picture, and running on the back of Wang's city, when he came to the first floor, he saw a dark shadow standing at the other end of the corridor.
The man was very similar to a solitary, with a shimmer of red in his left eye, with blood leaking under his coat, and with something in his hand.
"Sometimes lonely," Chen shouted directly, but the other did not respond, and he turned away, and the smell of the corridor faded a little.
Chen's impressions of loneliness and weakness were very different from the one he had just seen: What happened to him just a few seconds before I entered the door?
The shadowed most of the monsters, and Chen quickly led the members of the community away from the teaching building.
"Mr. White, what happened to these monsters? Why can't one see them except by turning their eyes? And why don't they attack the King and the Torch, and not you?"
"These monsters should be used by the school to punish the students, even if it is possible that they were the ones who broke the school rules.
Chen didn't realize that the monsters weren't even afraid of the red coat, they completely lost their senses, they were a bunch of crazy.
"The master wants to create a beautiful "land" after the "gate" and you remember the past, which is contrary to his intentions and he will naturally turn to you.
Chen examined Wang's and Zhang's bodies, and the black threads had already drilled into their wounds, near the wounds, and could still smell a faint odor: be careful, the monsters may want to make you their kind.
Standing outside the classroom, Chen, using his dark eyes, did not see the last save his darkness.
"If he's really lonely, why doesn't he come to me? Isn't it time to meet? Or is he really being watched?"
Chen has nothing to do with the solitary, he needs to guess the solitary's mind, then to make the best choice.
"Someone can help me."
"Let's go to the office now, the school's archives should be there.
The offices of the West are located very close to the walls, standing at the top of the office offices can take everything to the bottom of the two campuses.
"The monsters I've seen in this school can be divided into: ordinary ghosts and stubborns, ordinary red cloaks, white cloaks with burns all over them, and the monsters from the East that spread odor down their heads, except for them, who are the most dangerous in this school, and the offices are where we're going, and there's a great chance we'll meet them, and we must be careful."
There is a tiger in Mingchi, and it is not the first time that Chen has done this, but it is a little uncomfortable for other members of the society.
"Mr. White, aren't you a teacher?"
Don't you think I'm not dangerous?
He'd been to the offices in the West, but he didn't realize that there were huge differences in the interior of the offices in the two districts.
The offices of the West were clean, the offices of the East East felt very suppressed, the ground had not been cleaned for a long time, leaves of clay footprints, the walls were scratched, the original white wall skin had become light yellow, and a big, big scar.
"The teachers in the east area usually work here?"
"In this school, the teacher's duty is not to educate you, but to manage you, and they spend most of their time with the students, and the office is just a symbolic place.
Chen tried to push the door of an office, the wooden door is not locked, the push open.
All the facilities in the room are very old, looking like things from many years ago.
"I've been here, and I know where the archives are," said Zhang in a cold voice, "and he's been less and less interested in talking since he got back to his memory.
When did you come? She was a little afraid of the torch now, and when she spoke she lowered her voice to what she didn't feel.
"Before I was deceived by Wen, I used to sneak into the archives to find out what this school was all about.
The Torch was in front of me. This place makes me uncomfortable and may hide something very dangerous.
I don't know if the monster in the office is aware of the torch, or for other reasons, on the way they didn't encounter danger, to the third floor of the office.
"Here's the file room. We'll find what we want and we'll leave right away. Don't stay too long. I always feel like there's someone else in the room.
The Torch opened the main door of the archives, which contained several rusted metal cabinets and four rows of wooden shelves.
Chapter 821
There was a smell spreading through the archives, and Chen covered his mouth and entered the room first.
The wooden bookshelves look back on years, and next to them are rusted archive cabinets placed together, with an unknown sense of contradiction.
"These bookshelves and metal cabinets seem to be things from different schools.
Chen handed out a piece of information from a wooden shelf, but perhaps because of the poor preservation of the environment, he used a little force, the paper bag appeared to be damaged.
"It looks like this information hasn't been taken seriously by the school.
Chen carefully opened up the paper bag, and the contents of it made him doubt: "Thanks to the donor list? How does this paper look familiar?
Chen looked at it again and again, and suddenly he saw a picture in his mind, and he looked surprised at his paper bag filled with worms: "I seem to have seen such a list in the headmaster's office in the school!
He looked closely and remembered what had happened to him that was more surprising than the name of the donor.
"It's exactly the same! I've seen this list in the office of the principal of the Fuyang secondary school! "
Initially, in search of the old principal, many times entered the old principal, the two-star horror scene has been turned over, but it is a pity dug three feet not find the old principal.
"The world behind the door is made up of the memories of the people behind the door. This school is special, it seems to be formed by the memories of all the people inside the door.
Chen gently put on his chin: "In addition to the old principal, everyone else is in my ghost house. Here is the list of the donors. Does it mean the old principal is also in the school?"
Chen opened his eyes and looked at the dusty bookshelf in front of him, and the more he looked, the more he felt familiar.
"It looks like I have something to do with the old principal.
He put the papers back to their originals, with a delicious expression: "There were nine preconditions before the unlocking of the Tormenting School Trial, and was there any special connection between these nine preconditions and the Tormenting School?"
"Mr. White, have you found anything?"
"There are some discoveries, but we are not yet sure."
Chen also pulled out a tidy file, filled with molds: " Campus Environment Survey Book?
It's more like a garbage room where you can find all kinds of documents, including graduation designs, bills of expenses, company statistics, dining hall procurement catalogues, etc.
"Mr. White," said Zhu Long, who had found a few wrinkled papers in the corner of the town, and took one of them to Chen-"You see the big picture in the middle.
"The teaching building caught fire for unknown reasons, several students were trapped in toilets, and firefighters bravely broke into the fire scene and rescued them."
The report in the middle of the newspaper, very awake.
"The people who write this report should not be of any age," he said.
Chen took over the newspaper, which was filled with mushrooms, and left a large stain, many of which were blurred: "It looks like a school newspaper.
After looking through all the papers, Chen discovered a familiar name, the West Private School.
The name has appeared many times, and many of the stories are about private schools in West City.
"Isn't the West Private School where Zhang Ya lives?"
In the abandoned school, Chen had his first date with the Red Dress.
Also in that school, he entered Zhang's heart.
When you think back, he saw a burning stair lift in the classroom.It's a little strange that not only the private school in Westtown, but also some of the abandoned schools that I've visited, including the school in Fuyang, have burned down.
He looked at the newspaper he handed to Zhulong, where the firefighter rescued six people from the upper floor toilet, and the newspaper called the firefighter a hero, and the whole article was praised.But he also saw at the side of the paper a report calling for people to learn about summer fire, in which he implied that one of his classmates had died in the fire.
"The fire started from the toilet, but how do the toilets fire? The fire occurred after the students had their evening homework, and they were already out of school, so why are the children staying in the toilets on the top of the school?"
Combined with several reports, Chen was very sensitive to the problem: "The fire burned on the fourth floor, at the time there were only students in the toilet, the firefighter rescued six, but another student was lost in the fire, which means that there should be seven people in the toilet at the time!"
What was the cause of the fire, it is not clear now, there is no record of it at all, the child who died in the fire seems also to be a taboo.
But when I went there didn't feel any 'extraordinary'? Chen had doubts in his heart: If the door to the toilet was pushed by the child who died in the fire, then he should be the'pusher' of the private school, but the school in the school system could become a Samsung scene entirely because of Zhang Ya!
Now that private school has become part of the ghost house scene, Chen is very sure that Zhang Ya is the school's most terrifying existence.
"There is a door in every Samsung scene, but the only private school in West is Samsung, but there is no door. " Chen, looking at his shadow, remembers the name, he repeats it, and still has no answer.
"The reason why the West Private School can be rated as a Samsung scene is because Zhang Ya, as far as I know, has not opened any door, and when I went to the West Private School, I did not see any door..."
Chen, holding the paper, slowly laid down, in his mind emerged the hit red dress.
Zhang, the door which should have been but has been lost, push the door man...
These three words became a line in Chen's mind, and he suddenly thought of a possibility.
With his eyes wide open, Chen took a breath of coolness: Shouldn't the doorman of the West City Private School be eaten by Zhang?
Only this explanation can explain why Zhang Ya is different from the others, why the strong spectrum.
What will happen to the door after the pusher is eaten?
Chen suggested various possibilities: Zhang Ya did not become a pusher because of his obstinacy, and the missing pusher should be slowly out of control, but in fact it did not happen, and the pusher would only appear on the bed of desperate children.
Wait! Will it be looking for a new pusher?
CHAPTER 82
Chen was shocked by his own thoughts, a homeless door, constantly looking for a desperate child, spent years, finally turned himself into a four star scene?
It sounded too unbelievable, Chen forced himself to calm down.
There were thirteen paintings in the studio of the laboratory, thirteen of which were painted by thirteen people who knew the secrets of the school and who were probably the thirteen candidates they were looking for.
The power of a single person can hardly support a four-star scene unless the other person overtakes the red coat, but if there are more red coats together, the result is not clear, after all he himself has never seen so many red coats together.
Thirteen, that number is not good.
Chen had a look at Zhou, he had been looking for an art company, and had dreamed of a scene in an oil painting room, this man should be one of the thirteen artists.
"The door should have a choice," said Zhang. "The torch clearly does not meet the criteria," said Zhang.
Chen didn't expect much from the studio at first, but after analyzing, he changed his mind.
Zhou is the most special among the members of the society, Chen now to prepare both hands.
Remember to tell yourself everything, or remember to be your enemy.
"It's a big fish. Isn't the way I used to treat him so casually?"
"Mr. White," I said, "I'll go over there."
Zhou went to the deepest of the archives.
Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run
Chen continued to search in the room brought his surprise far did not end.
Chen soon found several reports about the fire in the archives, the fire seems to have special meaning in the school, both symbolic destruction, and for the rebirth.
There was a fire at Fuyang High School, there were traces of burned stairs, the former school was more like a cemetery, and now I find that there was a fire at the private school in West City, is a coincidence, or a deeper reason?
In addition to the fire report, Chen also found at the bottom of the iron cabinet several archives preserved relatively well, two of which are very special.
One of the files contains the name of Linus, and above the teacher and classmates' evaluation of him.
The students do not want to be friends with him, the teacher is lazy to take care of him, the child has no mother, the father is a murderer, he was adopted as a child, but for some reason, he fled from adoptive families many times, it is very painful.
In his eyes, the only person in the world who really helped him was an intern at the Welfare Institute.
The newly graduated college student, not yet settled in his own life, funded Linth to finish primary school and to attend Linth's parents' meeting.
Based on the teacher's comments, and only when the intern is there, Linth's "multi-activity" can turn better.
There were no photographs or any specific information about Lin, but a hand-written signature was preserved: the Kuyu family.
The whole file wasted, full of wormholes, only the guardian's signature to clean it up.
"If I can get out of here alive, I can go and see it."
Chen is like a self-speaking, and is like deliberately telling someone to listen.
Then he looked at another, which had a date earlier than the others, and which had no name, no record, but a single word.
Hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold
Words in the file weren't written by the teacher, they were written by a child injuring his hand.
"Unbridled indulgence only intensifies the perpetrator, and in any case the perpetrator does not sympathize with and reflect on the perpetrator. "
Chen photographed with Lin's cell phone, then put the file back in its original place.
"The earliest record of time should have been left by the real doorman who, after opening the door, is likely to turn into another extreme.
"If the doorman Zhang Ya has eaten is he, then after his death, the door he has pushed is probably still doing something according to his will, and if I want to increase the probability of surviving after the door, it is better to follow his mind.
Campus Violence has never happened to Chen. He was closest to campus violence when he was in elementary school.
The teacher let the children take toys they don't usually play with to school, ready to donate to welfare.
Everyone donated, but Chen alone covered the book bag and did not speak.
Some of the most skinned children in the class began to rob the book bag of little Chen, and in the process of pushing the book bag to break the lock, resulting in a bloody intestine and a backpack cut out all the fingers.
Their fingers were rolling in the classroom like pencils, and the bloody plastic intestine was still moving a few times on the desk, making the students in the class and the teachers who were going this way look silly.
Later, when the deputy head came, he asked the head of the class what was the family background of the child?
Later that evening, Chen's parents were called to school, and then were taken by the police to question for half an hour.
To put it bluntly, Chen was the only one who was deceived at school, and as a result, his parents were questioned by the police.
But there is also a good side, at least since then, no more of the same age dare to deceive Chen.
"There is no way to get away from campus violence.
In this school, some of the victims have become new sources of violence.
The Ghost School is expanding, and the door that is not bleeded red will come close to all the desperate children, make them part of the door, bring their nightmares back to the door, brick their souls, and build a real grave.
After searching through the archives for a long time until a familiar smell came from the tip of the nose, Chen decided to lead the other members of the association out of the office building.
" Teacher, we are lucky," said Zhulong in a small voice.
"It's not luck, it's someone who helped us get those monsters out."
Chen is not sure if he is often alone helping himself, but he knows that there must be some things going on in this school, and those things are likely to be related to the often lonely brothers.
Let's go to the lab.
Chen looked at Zhou Zhou: You should have made a good decision
CHAPTER 82
Memory is an unspeakable thing, like never melting snow, like instant passing light, longing to catch hold, hoping to forget to forget.
Zhou has been troubled by that dream for a long time, he knows that is different from the others, but he does not believe it, and finally into deep self-doubt.
Until that day he met Chen.
The man was the first to make sure that his dreams were real, that all that he had experienced was not imaginary, but was marked by an indelible memory deep in his mind.
Zhou got the answer he wanted, but at the same time he got himself into a dangerous whirlpool, he didn't know if he would continue to follow Chen, would break down, or get rid of.
Would you like to? Chen, standing in front of Zhou, repeated.
"I..."
"If you're really not sure, look at him.
Zhang and the king came suddenly, and they left and right put Zhou in the middle: Zhulong, come.
On his way to the last of Zhulong's state, he looked very strange, seemed to burn flames, and the whole man was on the brink of collapse.
What did you do to him? Chen looked at Zhulong's left hand, and the boy broke out with his hands on the cell phone.
"We found a missing piece of news in the archives. A freight forwarder who used to travel around the university was missing in the school.A few days after the police investigation, a dead puppet was found in the trash of the anatomy room. "The dead puppet was him," Chen said, handing over several damaged newspapers.
Imagination wasted, Zhulong remembered many things when he saw the paper.

Every time he entered the school he knew that girl was in the school, even if he looked at the other from a distance, he would feel very satisfied and happy all day.
The school says not much, neither little nor small, and when can meet he does not say.
He imagined the scenes of countless encounters, but when the girl really appeared he found that all the preparations and practices were of no use, and he was so nervous that he could not speak, like a secret child found.
After that day, they left a way of communicating, the girl unexpectedly, she likes the feeling of control, and Zhulong mistakenly thought it was love.
His change was a mental disfigurement, the girl likes to torture Zhong, she always remind Zhong-you're nothing.
Their self-esteem wasted a little, and Zhulong became a girl's doll, even more terrifying Zhulong was not aware of it.
He's awkward little guy, and he's not any better than the expert on anatomy and criminal psychology.
He was like a lamb, whose hair was cut, and whose red stripes were placed on a woman's table, to be slaughtered.
Eventually this damage extends from the mental level to the physical level, until death arrives, Zhulong realizes, unfortunately, everything is late.
Blood flowed from one of the wounds, Zhulong held the pink cell phone, eyes stared at the newspaper of the Chen singer.
His memories of the locks were, after repeated stimulation, finally pushed out.
Do you know which piece of meat is pink?
It was like a needle, sewed the skin, Zhulong walked step by step toward Chan: "The meat is most delicate when the wound is about to be healed, she likes pink."
Zhong's body began to sink, his body had many traces of needle sewing, it was difficult to imagine what he had encountered after his death.
"Another half-dress."
Chen's eyes were so calm that when Zhulong was only two steps away, he lifted his hands and embraced Zhulong gently: I want to ask you to understand one thing, no matter when, no matter what reason, no matter what hurt you should be allowed, even under the name of love.
Looking at the boy nearby, Chen had a little pain in his heart, and he clapped on Zhu's shoulder. "I don't know what you're thinking now, but I can assure you that if we can leave this school, I'll let you see that girl again.
The line through Zhuang's flesh stopped abruptly, Zhuang looked straight at Chen, and then slowly lowered his head.
Grabbing the pink cell phone, Zhulong quietly back to Chen's behind.
Even if they weren't red, they were the top half-dresses, counting for the city of Wang, and Chen didn't have to be afraid of ordinary red dresses.
"Let's go to the lab. " Chen didn't ask about Zhou, he had the answer from the other's eyes.
When the child saw the look of Zhulong, the nails dug into the flesh, he should have had a wish, but now he has forgotten even that wish.
After passing through the bushes, Chen led the members of the group to the experimental building, which was his second appearance tonight.
"That red coat should be in the classroom. If you meet him, just give it back to him."
Chen's voice was enough, and he took the students to the outside of the building.
"This building is the nest of the bodies of the monsters. The art house we are going to is on the fourth floor.
Chen took the first step to the window of a room on the first floor: Now, go up with me.
Several students looked at each other, and then saw Chen climb to the second floor very easily.
I say he must be a sports teacher.
