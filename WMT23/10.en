Chapter 1064
Even on the frozen north, there was a riot on their own territory which the Finnish authorities could not have known, but which the Finnish authorities remained quite silent about.
The trouble was brought by the arrows, and it was on their "private" territory, and since the dead were not Finns, and the arrowsss had not made any pleas for help, what was the matter with them?
This is no longer a problem they can deal with from the equipment in the hands of these rebels.
At once, the commander of Partak decided to mobilize the local militia to deploy the defenses in the town and to do everything possible to ensure the safety of the town.
The facts prove that was his choice.
Less than half an hour later, a document was issued urging local police to do their utmost to protect the small town of Partak, and sending a special force to assist.
As for the refugee camps, they will be taken over by the Finnish Defence Forces, hundreds of kilometres away.
Name.
Through information from the Russian Security Agency, Jiang had the news.
The Finnish officials remained silent to his surprise. He had no idea how the Finnish had to send a rapid counter-force to stabilize, but he did not expect their reaction to be so calm.
Looks like this Camen ten eight nine again in this military base, has done something unspeakable.
Or do you think there's enough to get rid of the ugly?
No matter what Camen's reaction, the plans on this side of Jiangshan are being carried out on a department-by- department basis.
Most of these refugees are from the Middle East, and many of them have been involved in militia organizations or have been recruited as reserves and received basic military training.
It is certainly impossible to expect these people to open tanks, but there is plenty to do with compulsory artillery, at least not to throw artillery on their own heads.
As the second set of equipment entered the Partak area, Sami, with the rapid accumulation of prestige, drew a 10,000-strong guerrilla from the camp, and mobilized the entire camp and the arrow company to a decisive battle "only with the complete annihilation of the atheist army can the oppressive rule be ended".
A box of ammunition was loaded onto the broken bread trucks and trucks, and the workers took electrical welds from the factory, welded the heavy machine guns onto the skin trucks.
Undoubtedly, the U's had no fighting power at all, and under the same conditions had little to do with the regular-trained mercenaries, but Jiang's confidence in the end of the war was full.
The reason is simple.
It's not enough to fire!
At 2 a.m., six hours had passed since the outbreak of the riot, only 2,000 men remained in the defence, and the armed Samurai once again marched in the direction of the arrow company, preparing to "rescue" the misguided compatriots.
The large army marched to the mosque two kilometers outside the arrow company, dispersed and surrounded the military base.
Under the command of some old men who had been on the battlefield, the armed men with their shovels and their hoes dug out a simple armored pit, hundreds of mortars, set up dozens of armored fields, and with the raising of a signal, hundreds of mortars swung through the whole mosque, and a cluster of exploded lights covered the whole armored field, turning the distressed armored mercenaries.
Of course, the mercenaries staying in the military base were not hungry, and the first time they encountered the artillery, all the mercenaries rushed to the cover.
At the same time, grenades inside the military base, according to coordinates of the reconnaissance troops, began counter-attack against the mob.
However, these shell positions were too dispersed, and the bullets thrown from all sides made the artillery in the military base exhausted.
Although they were all experts on guns, they nevertheless faced more than ten times his number.
A mortar dropped on the headquarters and blew up a corner of the concrete defense.
Their face washed away by the dust of the ceiling, and Colonel Ano stood by the table, watching out the window screaming.
"Set! Why are these bugs getting so many guns?"
Suddenly, the guns hit all, and they thought that they were going to fight with rifles and their machine guns, but they didn't think that they were going to fight with their support.
"There is no doubt that is the circle trade that sent them," said Sardes, leaning against the table before returning to the tactical map, looking round at all those present, "Men, we can't keep up, and no one knows exactly how many cannons they have, for the man who supplied them with weapons was an unrelenting mixer.
Arnold, take your men out to deal with them, and tell them that modern war cannot be solved only by numbers.
"Yes!"
Arnold was marching, took the counter from the arrow, and began to order the units at all levels.
Upon command, the military gates were opened, and dozens of Humboldt cars rushed out, followed by four "American Lion" armored cars, toward the rebels' positions.
At the command of Jiangshan, Samurai ordered his men to carry a guerrilla force of two thousand men, and to carry a box of anti-armored weapons, and the front line of the battle was on the edge of the pine forest, where the two pine trees were.
After encountering the rioters, the arrows company Hummer and armored cars immediately dropped their speed, holding up the heavy machine gun welded to the top of the car, and fired a bowl-sized bullet at the crowd of the riots.
The mercenaries who sat in the car jumped to find a cover for the riot and the people started to fire.
However, they clearly underestimated the anti-armed capabilities of the mob.
Just as the mercenaries were sweeping with their machine guns, all kinds of high-explosive, armored RPGs were flying in a frenzy among the forests.
Of course, these are still not enough to compensate for the riots. In the war, although the armed units of the arrow company were not able to cope with the sudden attack of the RPG, even without armed cars, these rebels were not regular armed opponents.
In less than ten minutes of fighting between the two sides, the Samis have killed more than two hundred, and the arrow company over there, has killed no more than fifty.
Seeing that was enough, Sam began to panic, and hurried to give the phone to Jiangshan, to seek help.
"We're starting to lose our front lines, and their guns are really too sharp! Many of us are the first to touch guns, and we can't beat them at all..."
Don't worry about it.
Eang's words made Sam shake.
All right? What's up?
Just as hesit, the ground shaking away from the earthquake, followed by an explosion from far away.
The shock wave from the pine trees, swept through the moss, even brushed over Liu Hai before his face.
Until Sam had a reaction to what was going on, he saw the smoke rising from the military base, and opened his mouth with astonishment.
Standing on a small hill on the other side of the battlefield, Jiangshan through the telescope to the bottom of the gorgeous smoke, the corner of the mouth did not attract any smile.
Looks like the Alpha's out of hand.

Chapter 1065 End of Arrow Company
Under pressure from the mortars, the chaos of the base was extraordinary, and no one had noticed that such a special force had entered the camp.
Without much effort, Kutpov placed a message on the pre-determined target, then took the small team out of the base, securely reached the departure point, and called for an air strike.
Shortly afterwards, Russian hidden bombers wandered over the clouds, dropping four torpedoes that accurately shot down two ammunition and two fuel tanks inside the base.
The blast swept through the camp and directly knocked down a circle of concrete.
The explosives and burning fires flew through the camp, causing a series of chain reactions, all around flames, all around blood and bodies.
The Guards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Medical personnel carrying loads were marching through the base, searching for casualties who lost their ability to act.
Workers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the soldiers who were still moving were moving, looking for their own troops.
Sardes looked at the lights outside the window, and in his stubborn eyes was a gradual sign of despair.
The thick smoke covered the whole base, the light of the whole night sky dyed red, just like the end of the world.
"Shet..."
murmuring, he moved, like two legs, slowly out of the window.
He turned and the commander's staff were in sight.
What should we do, sir?
The remains of the explosion were quiet, there were no more explosives in the base, but the mood of all was not calm, and the mercenaries who escaped from the explosion were clear that the next was the beginning of their nightmare.
The previous explosion seemed to light up some signal, to sound the signal of the Sami attack.
With the blessing of the morning, Sam took the opportunity to pass a little, stood before all, shouted, with the rest of the violence.
More than six thousand people ran to the pine trees shining with fire.
Looking far, the scene was spectacular.
At the same time, looking at the smoke floating behind the base, all the mercenaries fighting on the front line fell into panic, the original high spirit fell to the bottom of the valley in a moment.
When faced with a flood of people, even if they had the strength to hold the line, they did not want to fight anymore.
There was no doubt, the line of the arrow company was broken, the resistance of the mercenaries in front of the Sami people's sea tactics.
Some fled back to the burning base, but most fled as soldiers, fled to the depth of the forest.
There's no need for the morning reminder, even the head pig should know what should be done at this time.
Looking at Sammy with the rebels begin to attack the military base, E morning took up the telescope in his hand, summoned from the storage space the pre-prepared越野摩托, gently hit Aisha's back.
Almost, let's go too.
"Well!"
Aisha pointed at him, and as soon as the river sat on the motor, a moving cross sat behind him.
The engine whispered and the tires scratched a piece of snow.
Jiang ran down the hills on his overseas motor, took Aisha to the side of the base, parked the motor on the side of the road, shivered the laser sword out of the storage space, took in his hand more than two strokes, without abrasion, cut off the wire-woven protective wall.
The whole base washed away by fire and confusion, and from time to time there were bursts of mortar, and all the mercenaries who could carry the guns were on the front line, fighting with the mob for control of the base gate.
Aside from one guard in front of the command, the whole rear has seen no one.
There's nothing like this to Jiangshan and to Aisha.
A total of ten guards stood on the guard tower, and the remaining eight guards stood at the entrance to the first and second floors, respectively.
Aysa took out the ghost sniper rifle, quietly settled the two guards standing on the guard tower, then used the dead angle of vision, to kill each of the eight downstairs.
As soon as Aisha had settled the guards outside the command, Eangshan took out his rifle and marched toward the main door, just as he passed through the door of the Hummer, but just as he crashed into Sardes, who had escaped from the command, and the command's officers.
To the upper view, both sides obviously froze.
The Chief of Staff first reacted, immediately extending his hand into his chest, but his hand had not touched his chest, and soon Aisha had blown his head.
Sardes was trying to resist, but was easily controlled by River morning, with his hands pressed on one side of the Hummer.
"Saldes, man, 43 years."
As General Manager and as Chief of Staff, am I right?
Though it was the first time they met, they stored his photographs and personal information in a full breath helmet linked to the Enterprise's database.
Just a face, about his information is projected on a full-screen.
His face was pressed on the top of the car, and the sadness of it was that he refused to surrender, he said, tearing his teeth.
"I won't say anything. you kill me..."
Did I kill you? I didn't ask anything.
Jiang, grinning, had no regard for his uncooperative attitude, took out a needle from his right hand, and unkindly stuck it to his shoulder.
"Well-"
His throat whispered, and Sardes stared with bloody eyes, but soon the glory of his eyes faded.
Jiang's hands were loose, and ordinary people who injected tobacco could resist, and there was no such precedent.
He turned his face, and asked the morning.
"Where is Carmen?
"In the laboratory of underground cover."
"Where is the underground?
"The entrance is in the center of the base and can only be entered through the stairs.
There are two stops next to the entrance.
As soon as Jiang had the information he wanted.
"Well, you can do it now.
Jiangshan took out a gun to his head, then dropped his body aside.
It's a rather painful death, but for the famous arrow company managing director, Mr. Sardes, to die in this silent form, may be more painful than death itself...
If the dead were to suffer.
"The underground."
Looking toward the center of the base, Jiang's mouth corner raised a cold laugh.
No matter what Carmen is trying to do, his good fortune should have come to the end.
The fate of the Rothschild family will be as they began, because of a war fame, because of a war death silently...
At this moment, however, a terrible thunder came from far away.
(Unfinished)
Chapter 1066.
The trembling swept through the battlefield, and even covered the explosion of the bullet.
In the midst of a fierce battle between the mercenaries and the mob, a dark shadow suddenly entered the battlefield.
With the light of the light bulb, all see the look of the monster.
Their legs, their arms, were painted black swords, and their long mouths were decorated with a pointed tooth the size of a grain of rice, and behind them were two pairs of short wings, like a mantis.
A brief stop for two seconds.
Everybody wasted by this scene.
However, at the moment of ceasefire, the mantis moved.
The bow's legs burst out, and the seven-foot-high body exploded like a gun.
Unable to respond to the most recent of the rebels, the wrong sword was cut off the head, and the artery sped back with blood.
Throwing the hunt down, the monster's shuttle-like mouth burst out of its neck, accompanied by a squeaking crunch, drinking almost to the hunt's bone marrow and blood.
The look of the boiled hair drinking blood is as cruel as the beast.
Even the blinded believers, at this time also the uncontrollable swelling of the stomach, the thighs began shaking backward.
"Ibris..."
It's the name of the devil, like Satan in the Bible.
"It's Iblis!"
I don't know who cried like this.
The crowded up their G36 rifles and shot dead with their triggers at the monster.
However, the mantis only raised the two blades of his hand, and let the bullet bite locally on the corneal armor, without the slightest sight of the 5.56mm bullet hit.
Most of all, the mantis monster, is not only one! There have been dozens of shadows on the ground, jumping from the entrance of the underground cover, waving their blades to the storm.
Once you're close, you're waiting for the fate of those who are violent.
Besides mantis, there is also a maggot-shaped, fat creature, which sprays highly corrosive saliva, even solid things like steel and cement are defeated by its strong corrosiveness, not to mention human flesh.
Faced with the myth of the devil, the believers finally began to fear.
As they came, Ben was the rebellion of the uals, and the people fell uncontrollably.
On the other side of the unbelieving mercenaries, they cheered.
It's you!
Even though it's a little creepy.
However, their cheering did not last long, and soon a similar nightmare came upon them.
Dense spores floated out of the underground cover and slowly spread throughout the camp, almost invisible in the darkness.
People who first touched these spores began to breathe difficulty, and then tearful pain began to spread from the chest cavity, and they cried and scratched their skins, letting the blood flow.
Soon, they lost their sense of the whole body, becoming close to the existence of a dead body.
Aside from those whose bodies were wrapped in mechanical outer bones, those who were on the battlefield, be they my enemies, were all swallowed up by the spores.
In order to survive, the mercenaries and the mob turned their guns towards each other and began to face the common enemy.
Nevertheless, from the beginning, they did not win.
Hold the grass, what is that thing?
As long as the claws of several categories of monsters, the cold sweat of the river springs a foot on his chest,
He threw away the shot, took out the laser sword, danced two swords, and cut off one arm.
Green blood washed out and burned swords vaporized into mist.
While the monster cried back, the morning did not follow, shaking with the right hand of the sword, a rotating blade separated from the sword, when the head split into the face of the monster, cut off its half face.
Fortunately, he didn't have a hand, otherwise he would have been beaten.
On the other side, Aisha raised a ghost sniper rifle, calmly exploded the shells of two mutants.
There are too many of them to stay here any longer.
Jiang picked up PK 2000 on the ground, replacing the jacket, "prepared to withdraw."
Aisha glanced, but did not move.
"When I come to interrupt-"
You go ahead, hurry!
Jiangshan grabbed Aisha's shoulder, pushed her behind, lifted a rifle and swept through several dead bodies who had stumbled toward him.
Yes, it's dead.
But it looks a little different from the ones he met in Cagayan, where they don't seem to be infected with viruses, but rather look a bit like the ones over there.
Warning: Unknown pathogens have been detected in the air and the filter has been opened automatically.
If necessary, please.
Looking at the two lines projected on the helmet screen, Jiangshan suddenly realized what these things are.
It's just too much.
The same thing he had in the sight of the sea.
In spite of all this, Jiang did not hesitate to use his supreme command in the Star circle trade, to circumvent all decision-making layers, to directly link the C-1 deployed in the synchronous orbit, to line up the base's underground covering entrances to strike targets, and to call for an air strike on the base.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, let's go before human issues!
"Here's a C-1, and the target has been confirmed.
Tungsten core is separate from synchronous orbit.
The air strike is expected to arrive ten minutes later.
Turn off the communications on the ears, Jiang ran out of the firing jacket of the rifle, immediately to the direction of the defense net.
Aisha, who had run out of the protective net, put on a sniper, and began to retreat back to cover the river.
I don't know how, these monsters seem to consciously follow them, as if they were being manipulated by some consciousness.
Before encircling a large army composed of the dead and the mutants, Jiangshan successfully drilled out the protective net, at the same time throwing a nuclear hand grenade, dragging Aisha head and running back.
After confirming that the dead and the aliens were not tracked out, Eangshan took the overseas motor out of the storage space, and drove with Aisha to the nearby mountain.
It's not in the direction of the camp, it's in the direction of the Russian border.
The motor raced up the hill, Jiang stopped the car, looked at the time on the watch, turned to the direction of the military base.
Using the light of zero, he could hardly recognize with the naked eye, that there were no more people in the entire military base.
It was at this time that white light of the stars appeared in the night sky.
With a narrow tail, dozens of tungsten balls gradually bombarded the center of the military base, the dust of the explosion burst ten meters high.
"It's supposed to be dead.
Jiang murmured, and touched the telescope from his pocket.
As the dust dissipated, the base left only a depth of tens of meters, like the depths of hell.
Moving creatures are crawling out of deep holes.

Chapter 1067
It was already six in the morning.
The orange civilian helicopter circled in the high air with the yle on the side.
At the moment when the black smoke of the ammunition storage rose, the Finnish broadcaster sent their helicopter to the scene the first time.
They thought there was a forest fire, but when they arrived, they found that it was not a forest fire, but that it was at the much-acclaimed arrow company military base in Finland, where a war seemed to have erupted, and even at the center of the event, there was a deep, unseen pit.
"Here is the Finnish broadcaster, which is now broadcasting to you about the forest fires in the suburb of Partak..."
Although it proved later that was not a big fire, but a man-made explosion?
Wait, what's that!
The camera adjusted focal length and amplified the camera in the direction of the military base.
Only in the burning base, a corpse wandered meat freely, and from time to time strange creatures climbed out of the pit.
We seem to have found something impossible.
Previously unseen experiments by the arrow company on military bases seemed to be true. What is this? Amorphous? Dead?
Just as helicopters were sending first-hand information to the people of Finland and the world, Jiangshan standing on the mountain was also worried about the situation inside the base.
It's clear that's where Carmen spent her time building the underground cover.
The Tungsten bullet from the sky was not able to completely destroy the underground cover, only to blow up the elevator into the underground cover.
Spores continue to spray out of the underground laboratory and have now spread out of the base.
Jiang noted that dreadful bacterium could not only cause the animal to mutate, but also infect the plants that are rooted there.
"Isa."
"Well?
Aisha turned her head toward the morning, her beautiful chest long hair waving in the wind.
"I think... we might have gotten into it," said Jiang, laughing, and dropped his telescope.
Aisha grinned doubtfully, and he did not understand the meaning of Jiang's words.
Jiang shook his head and did not explain to her.
Just then, a warning came to my mind, and Jiang and Aisha turned almost simultaneously, and pulled out their guns toward the junction.
Come out, I count to three.
Jiang said softly, his fingers brushed off the insurance.
With his hands above his head, a man dressed in a very glamorous fur stood up and spoke in a rather unstandardized Chinese.
Don't worry about yourself.
Looking at the scar and the wrinkles of the face, Jiang-shan took the pistol, relaxed his mouth, indicated that Aisha would also take the pistol, looked at him grinning.
"I fired at a little less.
"Thank you," said Kutpov, putting down his raised hands, and walking up to the bank of the river, he lifted his bar in the direction of the military base below the mountain.
"The special situation will not be explained for an hour and a half," he said.
Jiangshan.
All right, then, said Cutoff, pointing at the direction of the mountain, If you are not going to return to the camp, you can go with us to the point where there are helicopters waiting for us.
It is certainly impossible to return to the refugee camp.
Not only did he direct a riot in the homeland, but he also made a hole in the homeland's map and left a pile of rubbish.
I can't sit here if the Finnish government isn't nc.
With little hesitation, Eang returned to Russia with Aisha on the Alphate's "plane".
It seemed to confirm Yeung's guess that as he had just crossed the Finnish border, the Finnish Defence Force had already departed for Partak.
At a time when national security was faced with serious challenges, the Finnish authorities did not take any notice of the humanitarian crisis. tanks and armored cars entered the refugee camps, full-armed soldiers controlled the ammunition factories and warehouses without any hesitation, and handed over the weapons to the defeated generals.
There was no resistance from the Finnish Defence.
Or to say, without hesitation, Sam took off his weapon, stepped into the carriage, squatted in the corner, whispering in his heart the abominations of the old Ibris, and begged for the possession of the true God.
And those who had the chance to recover a life of the people, at this time most of the expressions are like him.
When asked what had happened last night, the most repeated words in the broken language were: "Ebrahim", "devil", "monster", "murder".
What made the commander cry was that the surrendering rebels seemed to be really frightened, and that it was almost impossible to get out of the dead place early in the carriage, with more than a thousand claiming to have been involved in the execution of the prisoners.
In fact, there were only ten commissioners executed that night.
"I've seen the devil!
It's amusing!
Throwing the brief on the table, Duvier looked at the map with a frowning, "How is the situation there at the military base?
"Our helicopters have been flying past, but nothing has been seen.
The entire military base was surrounded by a shit-yellow gas, and our pilots did not dare fly too close to fear that there might be toxic substances.
Let the scouts pass and let them remember to put on their protective clothing.
As soon as he had his word, an officer entered the tent of the Temporary Command and, after a military ceremony, handed over a letter to him.
"Command from the Department, sir."
After picking the eyebrows, Duvier opened the sealed letter.
As his eyebrows began to crease, he rubbed his bitter eyebrows and threw them aside.
"The mission has been canceled and the scouts have not been sent."
The deputy looked at the commander with astonishment and did not know what had changed his mind.
Responsibility, he reminded his boss, "If we don't confirm the situation inside the base, we can't make a war plan to begin the rescue.
"We don't need to plan, nor do we need help.
Thanks to the bureaucrats, the reporters are a step ahead of us, they have confirmed, there are no more people.
Duvier shook his head and pointed his fingers at the envelope, "This is an order from the Ministry of Defence not to approach the site within one kilometer.
Our only task now is to stay here, to cooperate with the police to evacuate the villagers of Partak, and to bring the refugees here back to the two camps on the Norwegian border.
Tied Tied, Duvy looked out of the tent, and cried low.
Let those bureaucrats go to Russia if they think they can solve all the problems.
Just as he complained, a special aircraft had taken off from Helsinki International Airport, carrying the Finnish Minister of Defence and the Vice-President, and flown to the largest city on the northern ice of Russia, Mormansk.
At the same time, the Russian Minister of Defence and the Secretary for Security rushed to the site, ready to seek a solution with Finland...

Only the circle trade can save you
The trouble of harmonious civilization is that their understanding of biology has exceeded the imagination of the human civilization that is in its infancy.
While the world is busy exporting morphology, they are already spreading more dangerous things-their evil genes.
Their DNA codes for living things, just like computer viruses.
Camen is dead, now that's not really worrying.
Even if he's still alive, there's only half a life left.
A harmonious civilization promised him the greatest benefit, which was nothing more than a few square kilometers, like what the Americans had promised to the Indians, that he would carry with him ten indigenous peoples to survive as a "model" of human civilization.
The only blessing of Jiang is that the forces of the Communist Party are now beginning to move down the slope.
If Cameroon were to be linked to harmonious civilization at the height of its power, half of Europe would now be a stranger.
But once again, if it hadn't been pushed to the bottom by the group of futures, if it hadn't been the gold apples that had been madly chased, how could Camen have been mad enough to go down this path?
Jiang did not believe that he did not see the danger of harmonious civilization, which almost wrote the gene of aggression in the cell nucleus.
Mormansk, the largest strategic town along Russia's Arctic, is less than 90 km from the Russian border.
Acknowledging the gravity of the problem, the Finnish Minister of Defence, while dispatching the defence force to the site of the blockade, immediately went to Russia with the Vice President.
The President of Finland had the intention to go personally, but the diplomatic procedure could not come up and he had to stabilize the situation in the country.
Since the event was very close to the Russian border, a bad even could cause the evacuation of the whole city of Mormansk, Russia also maintained the importance of the accident, Minister of Defence Sergey Shoigu and Secretary of Security Bart flying on a special plane from Moscow to Mormansk, where they met with high-ranking Finnish officials.
Besides high-level officials from the two countries, there were also special foreigners who participated in the meeting... or the war meeting.
Faced with the high officials of the two countries, Mr. Jiang gave a brief overview of the secret experiments conducted by the Rothschild family, collected by the Starring Trade, and repeatedly emphasized that this was an unauthorized military operation against the north of Finland, for the safety of Finland and the world.
Their rhetoric easily won the applause of Russian officials, after all, who were well-connected with Bart before the meeting began.
However, officials on the other side of Finland are not fools, the vice president and the ministers of defence are ridiculed.
Seeing that didn't work as expected, Jiang had stopped talking and started talking about the first focus of the meeting.
That's the danger of this X2 bacterium.
"In the center of the military base, the source of infection, which we call the mother's nest, is capable of producing a particular bacterium with spore characteristics.
"X2 bacteria," is how our scientists named it.
These bacteria are highly aggressive, and can easily infect organisms without antibodies, turning them into their own breeding greenhouses.
The infected organisms will show more aggressive and aggressive than before, and will modify their original DNA.
For example, with Spiderman, the Green Giant is probably a principle.
"That is, in a short time the citizens of the whole country will become Spider-Man," said the Finnish vice president, laughing coldly.
"The amount...
There's nothing to worry about for the time being, said Jiang, drawing a circle on the satellite map, pointing with a marker at the pine forest that was surrounded.
"Have you seen the dead pine trees? "The altered organisms...called altered species are impossible to leave the spore coverage.
Of course it doesn't exclude them from hunting or from spreading the activity of the spores.
There's one thing Jiang did not say, and that's what he's most worried about is the X2 mutation, or at least the X3 bacteria he doesn't smell.
After all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The only thing that can save you is star trading, which is something that needs to be done professionally," said the Russian security secretary, Mr Bart.
It's not yours to do this!
On hearing this, the Minister of Defence was suddenly angry, knocking on the table and drinking, "Now you say to us that only you can solve, and what do you give us to believe in you?
The Russian security secretary grinned, pinched his brow, and embarrassedly shifted his eyes.
Jiang, too, felt the nose a little embarrassingly, and coughed, "Well, it's definitely not me, it's Carmen who's causing the situation today.
What would happen today if you didn't bring in the arrow company and lease the northern wilderness to build the camps? Do you not even know that they are doing research on your land?
What are you going to do if I give it to you?
"Let's go to orbit," said Jiang without hesitation.
"Isn't your only two orbital flights in Ukraine?" the Finnish Minister of Defence questioned.
"In fact, we have a secret force, which has been training for a long time.
Jiang coughed softly.I didn't mean to be so early.I was out, but the situation is urgent, and now I can't take that much into consideration.
When he said this, Jiang also showed as if he had made a big concession.
The Finnish Vice President exchanged views with the Minister of Defence, then looked to the side of Yeangshan and Russian officials, and finally stopped at the face of the Russian Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoigu.
"I'm sorry, but your integrity is questionable.
We think NATO is better at solving the current problem, at least they will not say hello and shoot bombers into our airspace without a word.
If you're breaking the rules of the game, then don't blame us for making this difficult choice.
Finland’s NATO membership has been under discussion since the Cold War, but has remained unresolved.
Parliamentary elections have largely fixed the agenda for joining NATO, but the biggest obstacle is the final referendum, in which Finnish citizens are reluctant to give up their neutral status.
But if NATO solves Finland’s problems, then the most difficult referendums will not be overtaken by too much resistance.
Once Finland joins NATO will mean that Russia has more than a thousand kilometers of armed defense, not to mention that behind this line is Petersburg, a city of great strategic significance.
This is what Russia is most worried about, and in any case it is unwilling to see.
"Russia can't accept NATO troops into Finland, and you have a better choice."
Sergei Shaoui got up immediately and stressed, "If you stick to the wrong decision, things will get worse.
"This is a threat?" said the Finnish vice president, laughing coldly.
"It's a suggestion," said Bart in a soft tone.
"The people of Finland are facing life threats and what can be worse than now.
On behalf of the President, I thank you for your advice. In fact, our President had a meeting with the Secretary-General of NATO in Helsinki two hours ago.
Goodbye!
As high-ranking officials from this side of Finland stood up, and Sergei Shoigu tried to save them, but his face finally froze.
Remember to use burning bombs. To deal with those bugs, burning bombs may be more effective than adding bombs and pesticides.
"And if you're going to ask NATO to help you with this problem, remember that they mustn't use 5.6mm ammunition, that the cornea is naturally resistant to small-caliber ammunition, and that more soldiers have been sent to meat in the past," he said.
And if you can't solve it, remember to call me.
The Finnish Vice President, not knowing whether he had heard or not, left with the Minister of Defence and an official without turning his head.

CHAPTER 1069 The Beast
The conference room was quiet.
Only half of the scheduled, officials on the other side of Finland left the field in advance.
There was no sitting at the rise of Sergei Shoikov, who gave the secretary a look behind him, who would immediately go ahead and help his boss with the things on the table.
There was a sound of moving chairs and arranging documents, and the ministers began to prepare for withdrawal, and the officials on the Russian side left the long table.
Even half of the expected results have not been achieved and the meeting is over.
Jiangshan, standing in front of the satellite map, dropped the pen, and went to the door.
When he came, he took a man, and he had nothing to do.
When he left, he gave Aisha a phone call to help her prepare a dinner at the front.
He just wanted to have a hot dinner. The last time he had a hot dinner was twenty-four hours ago.
Yesterday waste all night outside, after Kutpov arrived in Mormansk by helicopter, the first thing he did was to call the Hilton to arrange a room, to go back to the hotel by express car, without even taking off his clothes, to fall asleep, until the afternoon the Russian Security Secretary Bart called him for a meeting.
It was now seven o'clock, and before the meeting began, he had taken only a tube of fruit-like nutritional supplements, at which point his belly had begun to protest.
Just as he was leaving the government building, Barter called for him, but he did not wait for the morning to go this way, and he went quickly to his right hand, and kissed his shoulder with a grin.
Have a meal? There's a nice restaurant nearby.
"I've already arranged dinner at the Hilton, or I'll be the guest.
Then Jiang gave Aisha another phone call to say to the front desk that the dinner had not been sent to the room, but had been eaten directly in the dining room, by the way, one more.
"Well," he said.
Seeing Jiang began to locate, Bart did not deny, took out the car key from the pocket, "seat my car?
"Please," said Jiang, laughing.
Unlike Defence Minister Sergei, perhaps because of his work, Bart didn't hire a driver, and traveled by himself.
This car is not called by Jiangshan, it is supposed to be a Russian car.
Take the seat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As soon as the car started, Bart's face fell.
"Dude, you've got us into a big trouble.
Jiangshan glanced at him, complaining.
"You're just like the Finns," he said, "and if something happens, you throw the trouble on my head.
If your Alpha team killed Carmen, there's not much trouble behind it!
I heard it was only 500 meters away, and you had every chance of killing him, but you're thinking about exploding what ammunition store?
Bart frowned.
"A man can play such a big role?"
"You can try to give him a decade of development, but he's never going to make the whole of Russia like that," said Jiang.
"What now?" asked Bart.
"Wait.
"Wait?
"They will naturally think of us when NATO is planted there."
Jiang laughed.
"You don't think NATO can solve this problem? It's just a few bugs.
Bart frowned.
In his opinion, without NATO's help, even with the Russian border troops, it would be easy to crush the bugs.
Eang laughed when he heard such a true speech.
It's just a bug?
Bart, holding the steer, paused for a while.
Just as he was about to go to sleep, he asked.
Why are you so sure? Don't get me wrong, I don't mean anything else.
I'm just surprised that you seem to know about this?T was the same time, and now it's the same X2 bacteria.
Perceptions from years of intelligence work told Bart that the two seem to have nothing to do with each other, but that there was a hidden link between them.
Jiang's squinted left eye opened a gap, unexpectedly looked more than Bart.
Just as he was preparing to make an excuse for laughing, he suddenly thought of the golden apples flowing from the factories controlled by Rothschild.
It was those golden apples that forced him to change his mind temporarily.
Maybe it's time now?
After thinking for a moment, Jiang suddenly laughed, and said.
"Yes, I really know about this stuff, and I know how Camen got this stuff, and you want to know why?"
"If it is convenient."
Even though the expression is not very careful, but Jiangshan can clearly feel, his tone is obviously quite careful look.
"Wait for a while we can talk about it.
Jiang did not answer, but rejoined eyes, returned to the state of keeping eyes on God.
It's half an hour from Hilton, and before he's gone, he has to think about what he's going to say.
There's a revolution going on in Germany, and there's no way to send soldiers to support allies.
American carriers are too far apart from the Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea seems too unrealistic, and will stimulate old hair's fragile nerves.
Finally, the United Kingdom, which has left the European Union, has not left NATO.
However, the British clearly underestimated the danger of the "mother's nest", and dispatched only a mechanized brigade, rapidly deployed through heavy transports to northern Finland.
Not knowing whether or not the Finnish government sent workers to cut down trees along the "infected area" and cut out a 50 meter wide boundary.
Immediately afterwards, the British Army fired twenty white phosphorus shots at the mother's nest, preparing for a physical sterilization before entering the infected area.
However, the resulted in surprise, after the explosion of the white phosphorus did blossom the brilliant flames, but soon the flames seemed to be "frozen" in the air, almost extinguished.
The spores, which were burned to charcoal, floated out of the ground shortly afterwards, filling up the lost portion.
Knowing that was not working, they extracted from the infected area a part of the spore suspension, and found that the single cell quickly consumes itself in the high temperature environment, secreting a special high temperature liquid, and extinguished the fire by wrapping the burner!
Self-contained cells!
This astonishing discovery has shocked many biologists who have been invited to test the spores of the infected area.
Even with their decades of experience, they don't know what this is all about.
This is not what was expected by Jiang.
Insects evolve.
Even a starship can do what a bandit thinks.

Chapter 1070 Let the professional come!
White phosphorus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides burning and burning bombs, the British also tried other things.
For example,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately, the insects don't use their chemical weapons, they don't throw in any reactions.
In addition to this, the UK has considered placing more large-scale burning bombs, which would theoretically burn the air in the affected areas once and for all, but the Finnish government is not happy.
Bigger bursts, the more than fifty meters of isolation must be used, if it caused a forest fire, the losses would be terrible!
Here's the Arctic, the primitive pine trees! Every tree is a living fossil!
The trees that were cut down to put out the bombs were enough to make Finland feel sick.
Moreover, the British could not guarantee that the larger burning bomb would not be "frozen" by the strange spore.
It's awful, but even misted gasoline can cover a layer!
Let's not let's not let's just show our future brothers some muscle and make them feel more comfortable joining the big family of NATO.
The British Defence made a decision, and the dispatched commander did not matter, dispatched two mechanized regiments, a total of forty "Ajax" infantry vehicles, and more than three hundred infantry in defence uniforms followed.
Their plan was to remove all species from the infected area within 10 minutes, to seal the entrance within 20 minutes, and to send special troops down to the underground bunkers to clear out the sources of infection.
Soldiers dressed in protective clothing did not realize the danger of the mission, but in the face of interviewed media reporters, said that if the mother nest appeared in London, there was no use for them to go, the firefighters could not solve them.
Their appearance has attracted worldwide attention, and this interview is of course also broadcast worldwide.
Similarly, in the conference room yesterday, the satellite map on the large screen has been converted into a Russian television reporter's live interview with the British soldiers who are about to undertake a mission in the Partakh region.
Jiang did not want to go with the old boys to see the news, because he had roughly guessed what would be the end.
But Secretary of Defense Sergei Shoigu himself invited, and it was not good not to give him a face, so came a visit.
To tell the truth, a bunch of big guys sitting there staring at the news, it feels really strange.
Are you sure they can't deal with it?
"I don't mean good luck, but it's important for Russia's defence strategy," said Sergei, looking at the morning.
If the British succeed, we will have more than a thousand kilometers of defense.
"Wait."
leaning on a chair, Jiang looked at the self-confident British soldier on the screen, and left his mouth.
London Fireman?
It's not worth it's not worth it's not worth it's not worth it's not worth it
As the army set off, the television screen moved, the reporter came to the 40 armored cars on the way, a side special, and then quickly the screen from the ground to the air.
The helicopter followed the mechanical force far away, sending them into the infected area covered by a cloud of spores.
With confidence in theft, the British commander, with the permission of the Ministry of Defence, opened up to reporters some of the insensitive combat communications to show the NATO group's fighting power.
As for combat video, due to the involvement of military secrets, will not be made public.
"There are 12 that have reached the target area, for the time being, no abnormalities have been found."
"The Species".
Turn on the insurance and fire free.
The intense gunfire and the strange roar last for two minutes.
The faces of all Russian officials sitting in front of the screen, especially the Russian Minister of Defense.
They were all seniors in the army, and it was only when they heard the voice that they knew that the situation in the British army was not, I am afraid, very optimistic.
We're fighting aliens! There are too many of them, but our firepower is better than one-"
Shet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The communications were severed, and it was clear that the British commander was aware that the following was no longer suitable for the media.
The only thing that could depict the war in the sitting room was the flickering lights on the screen in the muddy fog.
There was noise in the conference room, the Russian military face to face.
No one expected such a result No one thought that a mechanical force would defeat a group of mutants...
Only one.
That's Jiang.
If they were a bunch of insects and ignored their anti-armored capabilities, he would not be surprised that the British would lose their hands.
His only curiosity now was how many of these armored cars could be pulled out intact.
As for the infantry, I'm afraid even the bones have been eaten.
"There's been a little accident in the cleaning of the mother nest.
Here's a briefing for you.
On the screen, the reporter expressed a little embarrasment.
I don't even have a screen.
At this moment, Jiang's watch vibrated down.
"I'll go out and make a phone call.
Jiang rose early and walked out of the meeting.
The phone is from the Finnish Presidency.
Don't ask him why. It's not like guessing.
Arrived outside the meeting, Eang Morning walked to the window of the corridor, opened the full screen, and pressed the connect key.
There was no immediate opening of the telephone.
The silence lasted for two seconds, and the atmosphere was a little bit embarrassing, but at the end of it it was a shame to open the mouth.
Well, the British don't.
As expected, the regular army is not a mercenary, every life of the peace period is very expensive.
There was an unknown breach of a camp in the infected area, not even the entrance of the underground covering, for fear of a riot within the United Kingdom.
"Oh.
"The Americans said they would observe for a while, but the coverage of the spores is expanding, and they are now covering the 50m width of the barrier," he said.
Hearing the President of Finland, Jiang's face appeared.
The British soldiers killed were equivalent to providing the mother's nest with easy to absorb organics, including the bodies of animals including humans, and were more likely than wood and insects to serve as the breeding ground for spores.
This swallowed up about a battalion of soldiers, and the mother nest began to expand the coverage of spores without waiting.
From this point of view, the nest really has a carmen style.
Their guesses were tested, how much of Jiang's confidence in solving the problem.
But at this time he did not hurry to open, obviously in the face with the kiss of the job, it would be so quick to loosen the mouth, it would be too cheap for them!
I'm going to help you out of this trouble, you're not happy, now ask? What did you do earlier?
"Well.
Adjust the tone, said Jiang softly. "Whatever you say, say it straight.
"That... wouldn't you?" asked the Finnish President in a soft tone.
After a moment of hesitation, Jiang began to speak slowly.
"Now the area of the infected area has been expanded a lot, not even the mechanical travel of the UK, I'm afraid, some difficult to do.
Would you rather try carpet bombing? Although the spores can prevent burning, there's no reason to carry even a high bomb.
"We tried earlier, but it didn't work.
The spores that is removed are not at the speed of their secretion, but instead blow the spores farther away.
The President of Finland laughed bitterly, "Well, we're not going around. You're a businessman.
With a smile in the corner of his mouth, Jiang opened with a smile.
The President of Finland jumped when he heard the figure.
Can I get something cheaper?
The new dollar is not low, and the euro has recently depreciated, unless he throws in the Finnish Defense Forces’ annual procurement budget, which is clearly impossible.
"If you can't pay, we can also consider another way of paying.
For example, to sell to us the arrow company's assets in Finland.
Of course, when this happens, we're only likely to make a $300 million valuation of their assets.
Believe me, this is already a very conscientious price, absolutely much higher than the bank's valuation.
Saying this, Jiang smiled evilly in his heart.
The Company, though it was his old rival, had no enmity with the mercenaries who worked for the money.
After this incident, the arrow company is likely to go bankrupt due to the high fines issued by the Finnish government.
If an arrow company registered in Finland, more than 20,000 experienced veterans, would be a tiny fortune for the star circle trade.
As long as they are brought into the training camp and they are given proper benefits, they will soon sell their lives to his new boss.
Management is not relieved to dissolve all, to screen all of the basic soldiers and to pack all the weapons and equipment to sell to Africa.
As for the remaining two camps, this can be reserved for a while, as long as the means are appropriate, and can be used as a bargaining chip with the EU.
As for the two military bases that support the refugee camps, he also has great use.
The President of Finland.
"The deal."
Jiang smiled.
It's nice to work together.
"When will your people be there? If it's ten days and a half months, I'm afraid we won't be able to wait..."
It won't take long, Jiang looked at the time on the full screen, give me five hours.
By the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chapter 1071
Tens of meters in diameter is like a crater, sitting in the center of the military base.
Below this crater, about 500 meters deep, is the underground cover designed by the Rothschild Group for experimental purposes.
At this moment, this underground cover, has no breath of life, completely covered by a suspicious red meat bubble, spreading a fascinating odor.
If you look closer and closer, you will see that the surface of the bubble is filled with bubbles of the size of grass.
Each time the abscess breaks, a spore gas is released from it.
With the efforts of thousands of meat bubbles, innumerable spores are born at every moment, and along the entrance float to the surface, expanding the area of the mother's nest with brick tiles.
The center of the underground laboratory, like a meat mountain, stirs fat meat bubbles.
Being the core of the nest, it is both the heart of the nest and the "central processor" of the nest.
And that way of spreading from the top of its foot is like connecting the master and the submachine data line.
In its abdomen, a carved coffin of resin material, or "cultivation chamber".
Unlike the meat red nest, this painted black cage looks very hard.
It was rare to see a man lying in that half-transparent layer of palms.
He opened his eyes and his eyes stayed on the line of half-circle.
[ ]
Of these, 4,000 were new refugees who had been taken underground, and more than 3,000 were researchers from the Guards Brigade and the Underground Institute, and more than 7,000 were mainly mercenaries and mobs fighting in the base.
Each person can contribute two units of organic material, he has consumed half of the organic material used to strengthen the mother nest and hatch the alien species.
It's not enough.
Camen, who was lying in the groove, shook his head and began to reflect on whether he had gone too far.
If it weren't so crude as to destroy them once, it was impossible to get those Britons to create the illusion that they would win if they didn't, and to send more people into the pit, to give him more organics, to enlarge his power.
Now, however, the British seem to be more cautious.
In addition to continuing bombardment of the area, no more people were sent in.
Upgrading to a secondary nest requires 500,000 units of organic material.
There are two sources of organic matter, one of the most primitive for photo-cooperation, which can grow slowly only after waiting.
Another is the quickest, and the simplest, crude way, which is to eat constantly.
To digest their flesh and bodies, to enlarge themselves.
Carmen, of course, prefers the latter.
If light cooperates to obtain organic matter from the soil and the air, the area of the mother nest extends to the whole world, it will only be a few centuries later.
But if he depends on continuous swallowing, he can accomplish in just a few days the transformation that can be accomplished in centuries.
With this in mind, there was no resentment on Camen's face.
He chose this place as his home because the camp near the military base has a population of close to half a million.
If he swallowed up the refugee camp and ate up the nearby town of Partak, he would have already completed the first stage of evolution!
Their second-class nests will have more terrifying energy, not only will their range expand to a hundred kilometers, but they will also unlock new "military" species.
For example, a monster called Meat Mountain, which is said to carry only the fat of the tank can be fired.
However, due to the early morning of the half way killed, all of his plans failed.
Thinking about this, his teeth were tight together, and he cried.
Spores are his eyes and ears, he can clearly sense what is happening in the area covered by spores.
He was sure that night. He saw Jiang-in the military base, but it was a pity that he could not leave.
It is suggested that the host is still far from the organic reserves, and that it should be upgraded before the transition.
A thought came to his mind, a suggestion from his mother's nest.
There are no obstacles to the ability to speak and to communicate directly with consciousness, which makes Carmen feel more comfortable than ever.
This is one of the reasons for his greatness in biological civilization through the golden apple.
[Are you upgrading the army?] [You are right, too.] [Carman] replied, closing his eyes, and connecting consciousness with the control center of the mother nest.
A row of simplified upgrades now appear before him, and after careful screening, he distributes 5,000 points of organics to the reinforced Wings of the Swordsman.
The Swordsman is a name taken from the man who looks like a man.
Reinforced Swordsman, the back wings will be longer and stronger, not only as ancillary to reinforced jumping power, but as the true wings that can fly short distances.
As Carmen distributed the organs, a mass of unknown magma flowed down the pipe to the pile of eggs in front of the mother nest, under the input of the organs, the eggs began to mutate, together with the new "sword fighters" who were about to break cocoon out of the eggs.
Their eggs were thermal beds for hatching aliens, which for him were as common as the "camps," and at this time the ceiling was shivering.
He lifted his eyes slightly, and Camen's mouth caught a cold laugh.
The soil above the shelter has been reinforced, and the roots of the fiber material have been woven into the soil into a layer of up to 500 meters thick "anti-ballistic clothing", capable of exploding and of resisting earthquakes as much as reinforced concrete.
The British commander said he had thrown hundreds of shots on his head, and he had blown up a layer of cement.
Heaven's weapons can blow out the entrance just because the mother nest has just been formed, he has not yet come to reinforce the entrance...
Suddenly, his face changed sharply, and at the same time, the consciousness of the mother's nest was also present in his mind.
[Warning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Damn! It's the star circle trade!
Camen scolded, and seemed to have underestimated the power of the star circle trade.
Initially he thought a few tungsten balls were the most likely to rub off a layer of protective skin outside the mother's nest, now it seems to be no longer a layer of skin.
Damage to the protective layer already needs to be repaired with organic material, not much for him, it is enough to get to the bones!
The quantity of the organic wasted at the speed of the visible, and as Camen hastily adjusted the organic to fill the gap, a string of decayed cracks came from above him.
Aware of what had occurred, Camen's face suddenly turned, and his facial muscles became very twisted.
"Fak!"
(Unfinished)
Chapter 1072
More than forty armored cars rushed into the infected area, when everyone thought it would be a one-sided British army show, but the course of events changed dramatically in just a minute.
No one knows how intense the fires in the infected areas, but almost the whole world saw the result of the fires.
Only five of the forty armored cars returned, and all the infantry were there.
The shotgun wasted on a group of insects, and the commander of the battle, Colonel Moston, could not accept such a conclusion.
Not only is he unable to accept such a reality, with his cell phone surrounded by the cucumber masses.
From Kagan to Tokyo, the word bio-crisis once again hits the nerves of the world's people.
Originally thought to only appear in literature and film, now has been brought into reality, very light and easy to attract enough attention globally.
and panic.
Discussions about X2 bacteria have been raging on social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and around the neck.
"The last one was a T virus, this one was an X2 bacterium?
Is it good for them to study? State should legislate to prohibit these dangerous studies!
"It's hard to believe that was actually the British. Are the British armoured cars all paper?
They're just a bunch of strangers! Can't their teeth bite their armor?
"Last Day Survival Manual," "Last Day Burns" ""How to Survive in the Last Day," ""Limited in Quantity," ""Want to Buy Fast."
Send out the peace force, it's not a national problem, it's a world problem...
"I am very surprised now that every arrow company military base has such an institute?
"No," he said.
What's happening on the social platform, Colonel Moston, is temporarily invisible.
He is now worried about how to explain the disastrous defeat with the Ministry of Defence and Parliament.
A whole mechanized camp is so unwilling to fall into it!
God, the Prime Minister also hopes that he will smooth the matter and bring Finland into the big family of NATO.
And now, his face was pale, and he had not even the courage to draw up a plan of action, nor to say anything, nor to send any more troops.
Don't say a brigade mechanized force, a division filled in is not enough!
The Finnish government is in a hurry, half threatening, that if they can't deal with the mother's nest, they should contact the Star Trade to find a solution.
According to the Finnish government, Moston sniffed, because it was not a question of combat.
Even armoured cars can melt into holes. Isn't the mechanical outer skeleton of the Star circle harder than armoured cars?
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
As soon as he could find a way to kill those spores, the aliens themselves would be extinct.
"I admit that we underestimated the power of the mother nest and that it was the wrong choice to send troops into the infected areas,"
"Scientists from London have been studying the DNA structure of these spores and believe that in a short time they will be able to design a way to exterminate the X2 bacteria," Mr. Moston told the media.
"Does this mean that Britain will give up its military aid to Finland," the reporter asked.
NATO will never give up any friendly partner, but this is no longer a matter for the UK.
"God.
Come on! What's that!
Just as Colonel Moston was busy explaining to the media, a scream came from the crowd around him.
There was only one female reporter, who looked at the sky, with her fingers pointing to the infected area.
A "fire" came down from the sky.
Even a few kilometers away, you can still hear the sound of the blast through the sound barrier.
Originally shot at Colonel Moston, turned to the empty area.
Almost at the same time, the earth shaking from the bottom of everyone, shaking everyone's eyeballs, while shaking everyone's heart.
It's not surprising that's the first time the star circle trade's base weapon appeared in front of a media reporter.
Muston was glad the media moved the camera, he was clear, his face at this moment must be wonderful.
()
Farther than a hundred kilometers from Mormansk, in the Hilton presidential suite, Earl Morning was sitting on the sofa, overlooking through a full-screen, remotely commanding the star circle trade against the aliens.
Thermal Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb
"What?
Didn't fall?
Looking at the full-screen, Jiang Zhong sounded strangely.
Logically, even if the underground cover is more than 500 meters, it is not possible to stop the tungsten core bomb.
This is a tungsten ball falling from a synchronous orbit. Even if the 500 meters are made of reinforced concrete, it's going to turn into cement dust.
It's ancient nest.
Jiang's eyes moved slightly and gave orders to Ivan.
"Let me go!
No No No No No No No No No No No!
B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B
Their ability to recover is strong, and normal wounds can only be healed with a few breaths of spore air, visible to the naked eye.
Although the British did several rounds of bombing on military bases, they did not actually kill any of the different species.
Arms and legs may be fatal for humans, but for this group of organisms, it is something that can be recovered by lying in the mother's nest for a while.
Even if they were blown up on the spot, if they were dragged back, they would soon recover into organics and re-incubate into a new species.
Moreover, most aliens hide underground.
Jiang's warning plan is simple, too rough, it's tired tactics, with the heavenly weapons to the death!
As long as you can defence, one punch will not die another punch, until the mother's exposed body!
The tungsten core was not initially aimed at the aliens, but at destroying the underground cover.
All of the attacks are concentrated in a circle of ten meters in diameter, and although the recovery of the mother nest is as strong as the aliens, the star circle trade's basic weapons are not enough. As for the vertical penetration of weapons, no country on this planet can catch up with them!
Jiang didn't know that simple and brutal plan made Camen hide from the ground.
Round 1 Round 2
A round of tungsten balls fell from the synchronous orbit, Jin burned money, Camen burned organics.
Both were emotionally drained, but apparently the limited Carmen was more heartache.
Soon,the mother's nest couldn't stand.
To ask how to know, from the satellite image can be seen.
As the dust washed away, the soil was completely decayed and exposed to the roots of the mixed disc underground.
Undoubtedly, these strong roots are the reason for the strong underground cover, under which the soil acts as a concrete defense.
Their nest wastelessly releasing spore gases, trying to cover up its weakness, but Jiangshan did not miss the opportunity, ordering Iwan to win the chase.
The strike from the synchronous orbit continued to fall, and when the electron C-1 was deployed in the synchronous orbit, it dropped the last tungsten core bullet, covering the claws above the underground cover.
Defending a completely collapsed mother nest, burning. exposed meat bubbles hidden in underground cover.
Seeing this scene, Jiang-knowing the opportunity came, immediately order to Ivan.
"Mother's nest is full. " "Low body, stop the orbit weapon attack. "
Send me a command, 3 th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th
"Yes!"
Ivan answered with force.
It's like a waterfall. It's been fifteen minutes since it started.
The journalists, the soldiers, the townmen, who stood by the town of Partak, were still standing there, looking up at the clear sky at 45 degrees.
Colonel Moston opened his mouth and couldn't say a word.
Standing next to him, the Finnish Minister of Defence was gray faced, regretting that he knew he had to ask for the rings to be settled at the outset.
As for those reporters, at this moment in their minds, they have begun to calculate what kind of rhetoric should be used to accompany the "air strike" on the destroyed land.
Not everyone wasted their time in surprise.
Just when everyone thought everything was over, a line of fire fell from the sky to the ground...
(Unfinished)
Chapter 1073
For those who were standing in front of the town of Partak, it was only a glance that the sound of steel colliding with the earth came from a few kilometers away.
The Leader of Finnish Broadcasting gave a glance to the reporters, and shortly after broadcast the helicopter took off again, heading towards the military base.
Not only were media journalists interested in orbital flights, but the British and Finnish military also sent two helicopters.
It's supposed to help the circle trade when it's needed, but it's not really what it's for.
Through satellite imagery, the little movements of Finland and the UK were seen in the eyes, but not in the mind.
Since he took out the power armor, he had no intention of continuing to keep it secret.
This unit of only two hundred "micro" brigades, he started two years ago.
The reason he's been covering up to now, on the one hand, is because there is no fighting power around the night, really not worth it to bring out the power armor to show muscles, rather than hiding to make the bottom card.
On the other hand, there is concern that the regional arms race will affect his economic development.
The only reason for this is that the two concerns mentioned above have disappeared.
As for why, wait until the end of the war.
As the fifty aircraft dropped, the dust of the explosion had not gone away, and two hundred full-armed T3s with tactical rifles rushed out of the open aircraft, stepped into this sporadic battlefield, and surrounded by the cut-offs of the sky-based weapons.
Feeling the intrusion of the fast, the terrible whirl from the deep pit.
A single Swordsman, shaking behind his wings, jumped out of the deep.
When the artillery came, these aliens were hiding underground, and now they felt the breath of life, and they could not resist the lust for blood.
Their intentions, however, were destined to fail, and this time they met their opponents, and the previous group of weak chickens were no more than a level.
"Shout!"
With a sharp roar, a swordsman moved.
The bow's legs burst, the long wings that were reinforced behind burst for a moment, and the two saw-beared blades became scissors, and sharply cut to the nearest power armor.
If it were cut to the ground, the iron would have to be torn out with a mouth!
Late, soon, a transparent shield was extended from the left arm of the power armored.
The Swordsman hit the whole man on the shield, not to shake the power armor half, but to lay down the two edges of the horn material.
The long mouths of the shut up and cried sharply.
The Swordsman retreated with his arms to his head, but hadn't retreated two paces before the power armor struck his defense with a shield and then held his right hand to the battle.
The Magic Dagger stabbed into his chest, and then, by force, to the next tear, even his intestine was cut in half.
The confrontation occurred in a moment.
Camen, lying in his bedroom, stared at me.
He'd never seen such a twist, which reminded him of the long-held tale of the Ironman of Colo.
In fact, as early as the Los Angeles attacks, there was a rumor that a "steel warrior" had been created about the Star circle trade.
More unreliable rumors say that in fact Jiangshan himself appeared in Colo city "Steelman", his own image and the successor of a Stack industry really is too.
Thinking about this, cold sweat came spontaneously out of Carmen's face.
Though he did not laugh at the rumors, he did not think that Jiang had not only got himself such a "steel wardrobe" but also armed an army with that priceless thing at a glance!
Shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock
This team is not very large, it is thought to be the king of the circle trade, and the king of the circle is sure to be limited in number! As long as he survives the early development, the whole forest will be incorporated into his mother's nest consciousness.
In order to deal with stars, it is to fill with insects, and he has to leave this card here!
Even at a cost.
Around the heart, Carman bite teeth, consciousness to the mother nest consciousness.
Nearly at the same time, red blood vessels in the mother's nest seemed to surge, the meat bubbles sleeping under the shadows burst, a bubble the size of a sesame bubble burst to the size of a green bean, then exploded, releasing spores containing rabid factors.
All the ink green eyes were in one instant printed red.
"Shout!"
The roaring washed away, and one of the sword fighters fell into a frenzy, and threw himself overhead against the two hundred armed men.
But they didn't get close, and they hit the fire net that was coming.
In the hands of Jiangshan, this batch was shipped to the modern T3 type of power armor to adapt to the modern battlefield, the most obvious distinction is that the right arm is no longer a clear turning machine gun, but according to the battlefield needs to design such as grenade launcher, extended protective shield, plasma cut dagger and so on mountable accessories.
Standing on one knee in front of the tall shield, the right arm secretly emits a dark blue arc.
In front of the rear armored step, up the right arm triangular gun tube, pouring out the fierce fire.
Behind them were 72 mm anti-load guns, two-legged ground-anchored power armor, and a variety of high-explosion tear-offs.
In terms of firepower alone, this two-hundred-strong armored brigade has more than doubled the mechanized force of the near-thousand British.
Taking into account combined combat capabilities such as mobility and defence, Mr. Jiang said without exaggerating that there was no problem with the two hundred hanging onto about one infantry division without either side using air strikes or other field support.
Fighters in the front line were torn to pieces by the fireworks, and those nearby were cut into two pieces by the iron-cut dagger struck from behind the shield.
Cork protects against bullets, but is vulnerable to thermal ion radiation like tofu.
Green blood splashed on the battlefield, including the acid of the sprayer.
Carmen's heart to the end of the circle trade dead bar, will never here shrink half, now has the mother's incubation and digestive capacity to the limit!
At the end of his life, he wasted no money, and all the organics were taken out, transformed into sword fighters and blowers, and pushed to the front.
The only advantage of the insects is that they are not afraid of death, and that, under the interference of the will of the mother nest, even if they fight to the last alien, they will be unwilling to shoot at their guns.
With thermalization of the battle, soon the distance between the two sides was reduced to the extreme, from the one-sided fire suppression to the close proximity of the short soldiers.
Dynamic armor strong but not enemy, and the mixture gradually began to appear injured, see, Camen's face appeared a gleam, according to this trend, the first unsupportable must be the star circle trade!
Thinking about this, he pressed all the organics.
At this moment, however, Camen's mood dropped from the top to the bottom of the valley, and his enthusiastic face gradually faded into despair.
Through the eyes of a swordsman, he saw a string of lights flickering in the air.
The second round of star circle trading has begun.
This is not a man, but a drone.
Before the launch, the dynamic armored vehicles engaged with the aliens maintained the position of firing, and retreated in order, leaving enough field space for the aliens climbing from the deep pit.
As they approached the corner of the military base, a drone beehive crashed into the back of a strange army.
Thousands of drones flocked out, and a swarm of drones flocked to the wounds of their mothers' nests, which had been bombarded with sky-based weapons.
When Carmen came back, everything was too late.
Underground aliens were essentially sent to the ground, where only the aliens who had just climbed from the eggs remained under the cover.
Although the number is still impressive, it is not enough to stop the drones from floating like water.
Without fighting aliens, these drones didn't even fire a single shot, attacking aliens inadvertently to the ever-breaking insect egg.
Camen's face turned green.
"Fak!"
A hundred kilometers away in the morning of the river, he sat up from the sofa, his fist beat on the tea.
Come on!
(Unfinished)
CHAPTER 1074.
The drone that was aiming at the eggs suddenly exploded, a row of floating eggs caged in a light, instantly blown to pieces.
Red and ink-green plasma melted together, splashed out of the broken meat bubble, and burned together with the meat at high temperature.
Some of this blood belongs to the mother and some to the unformed foreign embryos.
Camen was lying in the cabin, cool from the top to the heart of the foot...
If he could still feel cold.
There was a sense of defeat in his mind.
It feels like the right high of the bomber, but it's the opposite A bomber of the barracks.
[Warning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their consciousness washed away in his mind, and Camen was busy looking at the organic store.
Nevertheless, when he saw the hundreds of stabs, his face suddenly faded from the last trace of blood.
Just now, he had all the resources allocated to the insect eggs to hatch the swordsman.
However, as the drones flew into the suicide attack, his organs were damaged to the most.
It is not impossible to digest the residues on the ground, but to convert them into organics takes time, which depends on the existence of carbon and the efficiency of photosynthesis of spores.
Cannon doesn't know exactly how long it will take, but a few hours is sure.
But will Star Trade give him this time?
The speed of the bombers stopped, and the strange attacks did not have any effect.
Standing at the corner of the base, the dynamic armored brigade, under the command of the commanding department, began to counter the declining aliens!
On this side, theraptor was torn to pieces by the fireworks, and on this side, the swordsman was cut open by an ion cutting dagger, splashed with corrosive ink and green blood, and even washed off the coatings on the power armor.
Thousands of different species look at many, but in the absence of supplements, destroyed is only a matter of time.
The collision between blood and steel, the first confrontation between harmonious civilization and pure civilization, with the dust of nitrous dispersion settled.
Dust washed away and no more aliens climbed out of the pit.
The front row, a single knee-powered armor picked up the expanded shield, one hand held up to the ground, and slowly stood up from the ground.
"It's over," said Shet.
"It's all done. "
Another warrior threw away his clay arm, and answered in a loud voice.
When the battle was over, no one lifted the mask.
High-density spores still float outside, and are dangerous even for those who have been given gene drugs.
There were those who stood on the ground waiting for orders, and there were those who simply sat on the ground and did not care whether the bodies of the aliens were malicious.
There was no cheer, only the rest of the loot.
A total of 40 T3s were scrapped on the battlefield, and more than thirty people were killed on the scene. For the new dynamic armored brigade, this loss was undoubtedly heavy, but for the result of the battle, it was undoubtedly historical.
Nearly 10,000 species have died under their fire.
Undoubtedly, even if one of NATO's divisions were thrown in, they would probably not have achieved such a large victory, nor would they have fought more and more enemies.
When he got to the front of the team, the chief of the armored brigade looked around at his brothers.
"Okay, gentlemen, the task is not finished, let's go down and finish the bug thoroughly.
Let me see.
He pointed down the touch pad on his arm, and controlled a reconnaissance drone to fly down the deep pit.
Before the drone was attacked by aliens, he saw clearly the following, then said, "Around thirty.
Who else has the courage to go with me?
A soldier with a rifle stood up from the ground and raised his hand.
Come on, I can still move.
count me one.
The Brigadier picked up ten men from the team, took the small team to the depths, opened the back of the turbine and jumped down.
The twelve power armor landed, and the swordsman who was sleeping in the darkness immediately jumped up, ready to fight to the death.
The traveller, as usual, lifted his arms, lightly depicted the strange neck, and with another hand took out the pistol and pressed down the trigger at the door of his head, and threw the paralyzed body aside.
The remaining dozens of aliens were separated from each other, and the soldiers behind were shot into the screen.
Passing the strange body forward, the soldier in the power armor came to the core of the mother nest.
Here they saw a disgraceful insect egg that had been blown up, and a mixture of ink green and red.
It's awful, Shet.
finish finish finish finish finish finish.
The workers took off the explosives from behind and distributed several aluminum heaters to the soldiers.
Spores can extinguish fire, but the mother does not have this function, as long as a part of the burning is inserted into the mother's core, it can effectively defuse the burning from the spore gas.
Looking at all the soldiers who traded the stars, there was a panic on Camen's face.
When an aluminum heater was nailed to his mother's nest, he cried red with his eyes.
"No-"
The soldier who was closer looked at Camen, grinned at the mask, and with his hand the aluminum heater shook Camen, then slammed into the core of the mother nest.
Bright light leaks from the gap, but much more is sprayed on the inside, and under super-hot burning, the core of the mother nest is dissolved at visible speed.
Looking openly at this scene, Carman's heart was dripping.
For this mother, he sacrificed the whole research institute, loyal to his guard, even his heart.
But now, the circle trademen in his face, will destroy all.
Resentment,,,,,,
His face was indescribable.
Just then, the brigadier came to his side, and, with his fingers, knocked on the resin cage, indicating that Camen was looking this way.
Then he took out his future cell phone from his waist and flattened it onto a film in the cabin.
We met again.
Sitting in his presidential suite at Hilton, Eang-looking at Camen lying in the training room, smiled, "I didn't think of it this way, it's really ironic.
Im staring deadly at the screen of the cell phone, Carmen's eyes are full of blood, are you looking at my jokes?
"Yes, I don't."
Jiang shaking his head, looking at the grim of Camen in the cabin, from his body has not seen any old aristocracy of grace and kindness, the tone has not brought a bit of pity, "I'm just curious, what is it that made my opponent look like this.
Carmen did not answer, and at this moment his brain was dominated by hatred.
Just then, Jiang noticed the black circle on his head.
"A gold apple?"
With his eyes slightly wrinkled, he rarely recalled what had happened in the history of the Rothschild family, whose people seemed to have been predisposed to the effects of the Crane particle wave,
Without the help of the external contact can be fuzzy sense, which is afraid the field does not have the ability.
The universe is filled with a multitude of uncluttered crayon waves, like electromagnetic waves.
And this guy, not only belongs to the kind of people who are prone to crayons, but also has a kind of prejudice to the golden apple, and even sleep puts the crayon wave amplifier on the bedside.
It's like you put a magnet on a TV, and it's not long before the TV starts to fade color.
Quite frankly,he's crazy.
After analyzing this, Jiang had a sudden apprehension, and was not interested in what he had said to Carmen at this moment.
With a sigh, Jiang shut down the communication window with Camen and ordered the chief of the brigade.
Give him a break.
"Yes."
The Black Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca
Bang!
His consciousness fell into the abys when the gun sounded and there was not a chance to speak.

CHAPTER 1075 The Concern of the Pentagon
It was not only the British and the Finns who were watching the battle, but also the Americans who were closely watching what was happening in Finland.
Everybody washed their faces when the Star Trade Festival released this weapon.
Then came the later Dynamic Armoured Brigade, U.S. drone flying tactics, and the atmosphere of the Fifth Corner Conference Room even cooled down.
Although the British were not clear, they still felt the kind of fear that flooded like tides, and how strong the power armor that surrounded the kind of attack was.
If you compare the K1 outer skeleton to a bicycle, the power armor is undoubtedly the existence of a motorcycle.
Not only does it provide the soldiers with high mobility armor, but it also serves as a source of fire power, raising the soldier's individual combat power to the limit.
Despite his position as a man, the most unlikely thing to be seen by the U.S. Department of Defense at this moment is that the circle trade has finally conquered the species.
It would be better if, as in the Hollywood script, the British and the New States were defeated in the face of aliens, and finally the U.S. Naval Corps, in the spirit of saving the Lord, waged a war to save all mankind.
The Minister kept on praying that group could flood the two hundred "human armored cars," but the reality could not be as he wished, when the drone group slammed into a strange nest, already determined the fate of the strange.
As the last swordsman washed off his head with an ion cut, the conference room ravens were silent.
"These hypocrites, they're out of here! They've said there are only two orbital flights, how can there be more than one?"
A U. Department official broke his silence and couldn't help screaming.
Minister Ashton Carter looked at the officer and shook his head.
When others say there are only two orbital air strikes you are sure there are only two?The U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research (D.A.) hasn't gotten a lot of equipment out of it, and it can only be blamed for the lack of intelligence.
But that's also not possible. ghost agent's native counterintelligence capability is really too strong.
Long ago, the CIA wanted to steal technology from space elevators by entering into the circle of trade, but none of these sent to the new country were returning, and some were burned or even vaporized.
Just then, Comrade Hilary, sitting at the table, spoke suddenly.
"I'm more worried about their underground weapons than about the orbital landings and the power armor.
If they could carry dozens of tons of tungsten balls to our heads at any time, it would pose a serious threat to American national security.
All the people who are sitting are nodding.
Although the 1966 Outer Space Treaty refers to the prohibition of arms development in outer space and the "militarization" of space activities, in fact, the vigorous development of military space technology and space forces, the seizure of absolute control over space, and the acquisition of strategic heights to safeguard national security interests have long been common strategic objectives of the various countries.
True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True
Looking around at all those who were sitting, the CIA director gave a soft cough.
"As for their basic weapons, we're trying to get some tungsten bullets from Ukraine.
According to CIA technicians, this base weapon does not have a high level of technology. It is just an alloy tungsten ball, about the size of a cigar, with a conductive component similar to a gyroscope installed at the center.
"It's easy to simulate their weapons," he said, with a little helplessness in his face. "The key is to get these tungsten balls into synchronous orbit.
Unless these tungsten balls are transported to synchronous orbits at the appropriate cost, the development of a base weapon is completely meaningless.
"Yes," he said.
The White House military adviser laughed, "It would be more than just sending these things into a synchronous orbit and throwing them out again.
And the danger of the circle trade is that there is no sufficiently binding international convention to limit the size of private armed forces.
If they continue to expand their size, we have no way of intervening.
Hearing this, Hilary, with his fingers against the arm of the sofa, he pondered, "What if we now bring about the relevant international convention?
"I'm afraid we'll be the biggest victim.
"You know, we spend a lot of our defense budget every year on military contractors," said Defence Minister Carter.
Needless to say, they have become part of the U.S. Army.
Both the Department and White House officials in the conference room, including Hillary, remained silent.
If the White House were to private military contractors, Wall Street would be the first to jump out.
Moving the military industry is moving the whole of the U.S.
Those,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Next year will be 20 years of elections, can sit in this position, on the one hand, to please the people, on the other hand, can not blame the U.S. financial group too harshly.
With the collapse of Goldman Sachs and the WSPs of Morgan Stanley and First Boston dominating the entire North American financial circle, no one would want to touch the peasants of capital at this time.
What should we do?
Hillary's eyes were locked.
The War ended with the destruction of the power armored brigade after the mother's nest, controlling the military base under the command of Jiangshan.
Victory was won, and the British mechanized brigade arrived at the gate of the military base and presented an application to enter the military base on the side of the Star circle trade.
His reasons were well-prepared, such as "recovering the remains of the fallen soldiers", "and removing the remains of the abandoned armored car", but were still rejected by the Star circle trade.
The reason for rejection is simple.
There is no body at all, and alien captured organisms are eaten by blood at the earliest, and sent to their mothers' nests as high-quality supplements and warming for breeding spores.
Star Ring Trade only promises to send to the British if they find a soldier's card engraved in English.
This is clearly not enough to satisfy the British.
Recovering the remains is the second, and everybody knows that the dead are only afraid of the bones being eaten.
Rather, they wanted to look closely at the Dynamic Arms trade, to gather as much information as possible about this new type of equipment.
Of course, in addition to this layer, they are most worried that X2 bacteria will be traded for themselves.
It has to be said that brutality is too impressive, and the consequences are unimaginable if it is used for military purposes.
The best way to overcome fear is to get one yourself, like a nuclear weapon.
Brig. Gen. Moston made up his mind, that they had entered the military base and had no intention of withdrawing, after all the Star Trade estimates that neither the bottom nor the British directly.
By the time the London research team came, they were saying that they had to study the mechanism of the formation of the mother nest, even if it was not used for military purposes, and that they had to keep it in their own country's stockpiles, in case of need.
However, the circle trade reluctantly denied them, designating the entire military base for private territory.
Finnish officials came up to mediate, and their president, when asked to go to Starring, handed over to Starring the assets of the returned arrow company at a discount of $300 million.
Legally speaking, the Treaty signed between Arrow and the Finnish Government, of course, has passed there.
For example, this military base now belongs to the private asset of the circle trade and is protected by Finnish law.
The Brigadier of the Power Armored Brigade had no intention of talking to Moston, and two soldiers guarding the gate turned him away.
Even if Moston's ten thousand were unwilling, he could restrain himself from returning to the barracks near the town of Partak, giving the news to his superiors before he could make a decision after the Defense Department's study.

CHAPTER 1076
The war passed overnight, and the next morning there was snow in the sky.
By the end of May, the northern hemisphere is approaching summer, but this has nothing to do with the frozen north of Finland.
Within the Arctic, if they were to pass through the Arctic Ocean, they would be able to see the trail of snow until mid-June.
At this moment, the flag of the Star Trade has been raised above the military base near Partak.
Due to multiple bombings, the entire military base could not be seen even a finished building, and after consulting with Finland, Starring Trade borrowed supplies from Russia to be shipped to the base.
The crew who arrived in Mormansk along with the scientific team built camps outside the military base.
Contrary to what Jiang had seen at the end of the world, these improved X2 bacteria are very tenacious, and even if they lose their mother nest, they can survive separately for quite a long time.
And that is why the risk of self-destruction is so great.
Without the injection of the gene, after the inhalation of a certain amount of spore gas, any organism will have a "death" reaction.
In particular, the more brain-the more likely these toxic bacteria are to be affected.
After arriving with a thousand-the first command was to kill the spores floating in the air and eradicate all sources of infection.
Although no drugs have been studied to kill these spores, not everything has to be solved by technology.
These spores are able to extinguish fire, but in turn think that since they extinguish fire by sacrificing themselves, and now there is no mother nest producing spores, the characteristics of fire tend to accelerate their extinction.
You don't need any special antibacterial equipment, a sprayer can produce unexpected effects.
Now the entire military base is still within the scope of the spore cage, and remains in the base in addition to the soldiers armed with the power, only in orange and yellow.
Their bodies were dumped a kilometer outside the military base and poured into gasoline to burn.
The black pillars have been floating from yesterday to the morning of today, and even the small town of Partakh, a few kilometers away, can be seen clearly.
In the commander's room beside the military base, Brigadier-General Clayman had taken off the power armor, and was now wearing a heavy cold suit, standing before the command desk, listening to the reports of his subordinates.
".
Columbia hopes to enter the military base to film underground cover and the remains of the mother nest.
"Let's get them to the circle trade for permission, we are soldiers, we don't have the power to go," said Clement.
This is the fifth time that the media has found the gates to the camp, and now the eyes of the world are focused on the military base, and almost everyone is focusing on the same question, which is how the Star Trade intends to deal with the after.
"In addition, Finnish officials contacted us this morning and the President wished to open a dialogue with us on the treatment of alien bodies.
They hope we can come up with a more environmentally-friendly treatment than through concentrated combustion.
Hearing the report,Cleman picked up his eyebrows.
"Then you tell him to either accept our program or you yourself want to deal with these sources of infection.
If they need, we can send them free to the nearby town warehouse.
"Yes."
The officer stood and turned away from the command.
C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C
But the chair hasn't been blown.
Therm washed, and a soldier ran into the commanding camp, and pulled him out of his sleep.
Their report is only six words, and lets the disturbed dream clerman no temper at all.
Only the officer stands on the way.
Report! The boss is coming.
()
At noon, a helicopter came from the side of the mountain and landed safely on the platform inside the military base.
Intotototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototo
Though he didn't have to wear this thing, now the spores outside are not low, but it's better not to be too horrifying.
Behind him was the Russian security secretary, Bart, who was also wearing thermal suits tightly and firmly, and counting around a noisy base.
Alice was supposed to follow, but given that she was not going to stay in Finland for two days, she had to return to the island early in the morning.
In front of the power armor, the commander of the Clayman brigade to the morning standing.
Jiang noted to him with approval.
It's hard.
"Where, not hard!"
Cleman grinned.
"What's going on underground?"
"It has been confirmed that the nest has died, without any remains of the alien species.
On the side of the logistics force, the X2 bacterium cleaning is still going on, and a team of scientists from the island of Colo are investigating and taking samples of the remains of the mother nest.
Take us down to see.
"Yes!"
C C C C C C C C C C C C
Following Cleman, Earn and Bart arrived by the giant pit in the center of the base.
This used to be the entrance to the underground shelter, which was bombed a few days ago by a tungsten core from the star circle trade.
After the three arrived at the entrance to the underground bunker located 500 meters below.
This is the inside of the mother nest? The meat bubble on the wall is really bad.
Bart looked at the remains of the wall, and there was a disgusting look on his face.
"You can understand that before the core was destroyed, the mother nest had built up the entire underground covering into its own nest," explained Jiang.
Not far away, researchers are taking samples of the remains of insect eggs.
Unheard DNA codes and the existence of known organisms have completely subverted these scholars' understanding of biology.
Everybody puts a hundred percent of their energy into these precious samples.
These are valuable information for the whole of human civilization.
For harmonious civilization, Jiangshan just a glance far away, say nothing is not enough.
He did not expect to learn anything about the weaknesses of harmonious civilization from the remains of the mother nest, but for the time being it is the only means of understanding them by Earth civilization.
As nobody recognized Jiang's identity on the way, the soldiers who stood there saluted Cleman and opened the way.
Thus, accompanied by Clem, the two came low to the remains of the core of the nest, and set foot.
Looking at the wretched remains, Bart looked at the resin-shaped "coffin" and saw a familiar face through the broken membrane.
"Carman Rothschild?"
"Yes," he said.
You killed him.
"For me," said Bart, "the International Tribunal is his best home."
"It's a problem to keep him," said Jiang softly.
He didn't know what harmonious civilization had revealed to him, and it would have been a problem if the insects had told him their ability to cross.
Now the Rothschild family has produced at least tens of thousands of golden apples, which are a danger to him, to human civilization.
And now he's here to get rid of the danger!
Jiang made a gesture to the next clerman, then pointed to the place of the head of the resin coffin, only to see clerman will pull out the tactical dagger.
Before the head, cut off the resin surface, stretch the steel hand inside, pull out a black ball from inside.
When he saw the black ball, Bart's face was a little subtle.
"Golden Apple," the black ball was taken from Cleman's hand, "and we've always thought it was a tool for communicating the future, but that's not the case.
Communication is their basic ability, their real ability is to wash their brains, to infect their holders in the latent silence, to turn them into their own walking dogs.
Both in the former field and now in Cameroon, they are essentially one kind of people.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Separated from his mask, he could not see Bart's expression, but years of carelessness told him that his purpose was almost accomplished.
Germany is about to win, and Russia is sure to get these golden apples from the rebels, and if they re-experience them with some information, they are unlikely to find anything to study.
Jiang must give them a precaution before they know how to use the golden apple.
Let them be afraid of this thing.
"The most important biological civilization that the golden apple communicates is not from the future. "
It's enough. It's a long, long, long, long look at Bart.
It's right next to us.

Even before the Munich incident, Camen, through a series of means, had the entire power of the Rothschild family in his hands.
After his eldest brother James washed away by the Star Trade in the Pearson Church disaster, the whole family was largely left to him alone.
That's why, with his death, the Rothschild family is almost done.
Jiang could have predicted that the first thing that would have happened in Germany, once the party had won, would have been to liquidate the "crimes" that the Communist Party had committed during its reign.
Not surprisingly, several families, such as Roschild, in Germany assets will be auctioned by banks to offset the courts' fine against them.
It can be predicted that in the coming period, even if Jiangshan does nothing, the Rothschild family will be on the brink of collapse in the frenzy of asset division.
They're just too rich.
It's too weak.
Jiang did not worry about their death, the only thing that worried him was the gold apples that were originally held by Rothschild.
It would have been better if it had been in Carmen's hands, and now that Carmen's dead, these golden apples would have flown out.
Not only in Russia, but also the United States, Britain, France, and even the far-flung countries of China, are sure to be interested in these games.
Harmonious civilization has mastered the communications of the golden apple, and it is difficult to say where the next mother nest will be born if the top of the countries fails to realize the dangers of this.
While sitting on the flight back to Moscow, Bart was thinking about the conversation that morning in the underground bunker, and about the hearing inside the mother's nest...
Are you saying this is the product of your extraterrestrial civilization?
Barta still couldn't believe what Jiang had told him, his eyebrows locked between his eyes, looking at Camen lying in a resin coffin, "and the golden apple is just a brainwashing tool?"
"Yes," said Jiang.
It's unbelievable.
"I know it sounds like a stupid joke, but it is.
On June 15, we will hold the Summit on Outer Space Security in Colo, at which time we will announce all the evidence we have collected on outer space civilization.
I've told you've got the right to take it back.
As a result of the information, Bart was on the ground.
Outside Civilization?
What a joke!
Bart remained unbelievable, even though he had spoken to him in obscurity the last morning in the Mormansk.
He couldn't believe that would happen in front of him, just on a Hollywood screen.
However, when he remembered the serious look on Jiang's face, his heart did not have to whisper again.
If the golden apple really is a brainwashing tool that can unwittingly turn its holder into an extraterrestrial walking dog, then it is really a dangerous thing.
After all, no one can tell who has been brainwashed, and no one who has been brainwashed can stand up and admit.
If a brainwashed man unknowingly made a mother's nest in Russia...
A drop of cold sweated from his forehead.
If you think about it, you don't know how many steps it takes to get from the rebels to the Russian Security Agency.
Aware of the gravity of the problem, Bart set the idea in his mind.
At least wait until June 15 to see what evidence the circle trade can produce.
Before this, the golden apples were temporarily stored and prevented anyone from approaching them again.
If, as he said, the golden apple is a dangerous thing, then it is not too late to destroy it.
Through footage on Finnish Broadcasting, the orbital weapons of the Star circle trade and the cool power armor, spread to every corner of the world.
People who were pessimists because of the British defeat, also because of the victory of the two hundred against the ten thousand, reawakened hope.
Those as ugly as demons, fell one by one in front of the steel armor, the blood of the ink-greens was stripped under a cluster of orange-yellow bullets, especially the last of the short-men, who looked as if they were boiling with blood.
"It's too big. Is it two hundred?
Two Hundred Iron Man?
I just want to ask if you join the star circle trade to have the opportunity to wear that toy?
If so, I'll go to the website to register for foreign troops.
"What do you think, little Robert Donny?"
"The kind of right arm with a laser knife is just too much for me!
Unfortunately, the screen is too blurry, if the camera of the Finnish TV would be a bit higher.
In addition to the unhealthy messages on social platforms, in some military forums, a discussion about the utility of such weapons has been initiated.
The Warrior was divided into two groups, one which believed that game called the power armor could change the pattern of modern warfare, and the other which believed that there was no need for such a surprise.
"It reminds me of a wartime bulletproof armor, with a machine gun inserted on the arm. "I don't think it's a big surprise, but it's a layer of steel on the outside of the mechanical skeleton.
It's better to produce a few tanks or armored cars than to develop a lump of iron that wraps the whole person.
"It's too simple to think upstairs, how did the British mechanized brigade get in? Practice is the only standard for testing the truth!
Infantry with defense, maneuverability, support ability, even anti-armored ability, on the battlefield will be the impossible Lambo! And also the kind that can be produced!
As for welding steel plates out of mechanical outer skeletons, you're talking about Krupp's "Blitz" series? Don't put the products of future man soldiers together, the two are not exactly a class!
Of course, not all public opinion is moving in favour of star circle trade. With the threat of a second “bio-crisis” unleashed, people are relaxing their mouths and starting to reflect on another problem.
What's the point of a boundary if the Star circle trade can deploy in any corner of the world a force as powerful as a division's armored brigade within hours?
At heartened provocation, many peacemakers spontaneously held rallies in major cities such as New York and Los Angeles to protest the use of outer space for military purposes.
However, these protests did not form a climate, even though the mainstream media in Western countries represented the interests of the elite, largely in line with the positions of these protesters, but public opinion on the Internet clearly favoured the star circle trade.
As these days are busy with the Finnish government "reward" has not been focused on the network.
It wasn't until he turned at the Moscow airport that the Star circle's powered armored brigade accidentally fired one.
Such a resulted in the early morning.
He didn't expect the power armor to cause widespread concern among governments, but he didn't expect it to cause such a topic among the people.
It's not clear what the effect will be, but one thing is certain: The high-definition footage on Finnish Broadcasting is almost like a free ad for the Starring Trade, and it's also the kind of thing that has the effect of...

CHAPTER 10
A few days have passed since the military operation to clear the mother's nest, and the White House and the Pentagon have held dozens of small meetings around the business.
No matter what you do, within three days I'll see Darpa separate from the mechanical exoskeleton project, and I'll talk to Congress about the budget.
According to the Minister of Defence, this power armor is provisionally positioned as a fire support for the infantry battalion, and in addition to the three protection functions of loading at least 50 kg of ammunition and nuclear biodegradation, it must also have absolute protection against ammunition with a diameter of less than 12.7 mm..."
At this moment, in a small conference room in the White House, Hillary began a separate meeting with the director of Darpa.
Darpa is an abbreviation for the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects.
In many defence and space programs, images of darpa can be seen, including the parade spray of the anti-emp weapon, which is a product designed jointly by darpa and Lockheed Martin.
Star Trade is already ahead of the U.S. in defense technology, Hillary has to put hope in darpa.
Carefully recorded Hillary's request, director darpa turned two circles of pen, the nose pointed slightly on the notebook.
"We're going to do it as soon as possible. Lockheed Martin has made good progress in the study of mechanical outer skeletons and we have the available technical resources to use.
In addition, I suggest that we engage with the German side, to see if we can get information from the Krupp Group on improved outer skeletons, which obviously already have the prototype of the power armor, but have a few design shortcomings.
"I'll let Kerry talk about it," said Hilary.
After exchanging some details with Mrs. President, Mr. Darpa joined his notebook and gave his farewell.
There were several meetings waiting for him, and he had to prepare the plan within two days to catch up with the hearing of the Congressional Budget Committee on the third day.
This is a multi-billion-dollar R&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; involves a multi-billion-dollar R&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp
Going to the door ready to open, the meeting room door was pushed, the White House assistant with a document went in.
"Mr. President."
Hilary, looking at her assistant, asked seriously.
"What is it?"
"The president of the new country has sent us an invitation.
On his way to Hilary, the assistant put the papers on the table, "It's about inviting us to the Extraterrestrial Security Summit on June 15."
"External Space Security Summit" """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Star circle trade is a good idea to open the space security summit? Who is to use space resources to develop weapons?
"I write a kind letter of rejection saying that the U.S. regrets the violation of the Outer Space Treaty and will not initiate high-level bilateral talks with the new countries before explaining it to the new countries.
"Yes."
The assistant pointed and turned away.
Sitting on a chair, Hilary rubbed the tired corner of the eye.
Ten minutes later there was a meeting, and as she was preparing to take a nap in her busyness, she suddenly noticed the invitation.
After a moment of hesitation, she took the invitation out of the paper bag, according to the principle of diplomatic ceremony.
When the eye swept through the two lines, captured a key word Hillary, suddenly was there.
"External Civilization?"
Their colours were constantly changing according to the letters of invitation.
When she read the last line, she threw the invitation on the table, immediately got up, and hurried out the door.
In the early hours of June 1, a Gulf liner landed at the airport of Colo.
Amid a crowd of bodyguards, Jiang ran through the special passage, came to his lorry, waited for the bodyguard to pull the door, and sat in the steering seat.
Aisha, sitting in the driving seat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today, the main traffic corridor in the center of the city has been completed with a magnetic suspension, and almost half of the private cars are flying in half the air.
The rivers and the neon on both sides of the street, the whole city is like a shining pearl, dreamy and beautiful, under the illumination of the high buildings and lighthouses.
It's hard to imagine what it was like four years ago.
On the car, Jian accidentally received a phone call from the Warner brothers.
Christopher Nolan, who had a relationship with him, offered to contact him, saying that the Warner brothers were very interested in moving the scene to a "larger" screen, and would like him to come down to the mouths of the early mornings to see if the Starring could help with the shooting.
Taking into account the positive propaganda of the Star Trade, Jiang accepted the proposal of the Warner Brothers, saying that as long as the Star Trade played a positive role in the play, the Star Trade could provide free help to the filming.
Hang up the phone, Eang morning take the full screen, stretch a laziness.
After two flights, he hasn't fully fallen by the time, and now the whole people are sick.
Aisha looked at the morning, a little worried.
What about over there in Finland?
All right, let's get busy.
Have you seen Natasha?
"I saw one before I got on the plane and she asked me for a dinner.
Jiang looked over her face, and she smiled, and her hand dropped from the top of her head, and she rolled around her thin and healthy waist.
Don't always ask me, what about you, I don't think about me these days?
His cheeks were a little red, said Aisha.
"I think every day.
Feeling the unfaithful move of the hand, the Aisha bureau hastily twisted the body, but no resistance.
Do not worry about traffic Jiangshan, magnetic suspension can be said to be more than ten times safer than driving on the road, the track at a particular height is limited by the intelligent program can only keep a particular speed, and after entering the highest cruise track can even completely leave the steering wheel, give the driving power to the intelligent program to execute.
Initially Jiang was still wrapping her waist, but soon had to step into the scale.
However, the little sheep are too gentle, so that the hand is constantly upward...
With a slight bite of the lower lip, no more can suppress the feelings of the heart, full of the tide. Red Aisha put the car on the cruise track, gave the driving completely to the intelligent driving system, hands completely away from the steering wheel, like clay cleverly turned to sit on the morning's legs.
His arms held up his neck, and Aisha blinked with a clear, blue stone eyes.
Being so stared, in contrast to the previous unreliable Jiangshan was a bit embarrassed.
"Well, drive well-"
Before the words were finished, Jiang's lips were blocked by hot and delicate lips.
The young snake pierced through the teeth, and a cold and gentle hand walked down to his firm arms.
Separated from the ink glass, beside the two flies the overflowing street.
Under these conditions, everything is as natural as water to canal.
Jiang sensed that tiredness accumulated over the days gradually dissipated with the warmth of the skin.
Just in the brightness of the night, a speed and passion is being shown.

Chapter 1079
The third lifted his head and looked at the clock hanging from the wall, and the rain of summer sighed deeply, and whispered in a small voice, "Why have you not come back so late?
About half an hour ago,Isa drove to the airport to take her home in the morning, and she went to the bathroom to take a shower.
It's summer. It's hot. After bathing, it's not too hot to change clothes.
Instead, he wrapped his wet hair with a white towel, and sat on the sofa in the living room surrounded by a bath towel.
A glance at himself, breathing rapidly, a summer poem rain's mouth corner not bend a shallow smile.
Suddenly, realizing that I was thinking very shameful thing, the rain face suddenly red, holding the fist slightly coughed, quickly breathed a few breaths, adjusted his state, again changed to the non-spoken smile, freshly despoiled look.
Only the look out of the window, and the love and expectation in the eyes, have had her deer-scrambled mentality.
It's been a little more than a minute.
Looking again at the clock hanging on the wall, the face of summer poet rain gradually not hanging, began to be a little worried.
Will it be a traffic jam?
It's not possible. how is the car stuck?
Did anything happen on the way?
Thinking about this, Xi could not sit down, hastened to pick up the phone on the tea, to give to Jiang Morning.
The phone rang for a long time, and no one listened.
Then she called Aisha, and the phone was turned off.
It's a little hurrying.
Just as she was about to change her clothes and go out to see, there was a sound outside the villa to open the door.
The light flashed slightly, and the familiar Renault entered the garage, and soon the two pushed the door into the hall.
Seeing the two gently returned, the summer poetry loosened the mouth, went forward, looked at Jiang morning some questioning.
Why did you come back so late?
Jiang laughed embarrasment, "I've been on the way for a while, why haven't I slept?
The rain fox looked at the morning.
No, if he were to see himself wrapped in a bath cloth, there would have been an unnatural reaction. Isn't that what he looks like now?
Where did she know, just finished four-haired morning, now in the wise mode, not to say wrapped in a bath cloth, put together a bath will not have a strange reaction!
Not aware of what was strange, seen by the suspicious eye some hair,
Jiang shut up and touched his face, he said.
"Is there anything on my face?"
Therm shook his head and looked again at Aisha.
Aisha washed her face,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
See, Jiang's reaction came at once, a quiet.
It's bad!
Indeed, the summer rain at once understood what, laughing squinted to the side of the River Morning, two hands "softly" held his arm.
There's something I'll help you with.
The fragrance of the flower penetrated the nose of the morning, and the moist hair was covered with water, and looked down to the beautiful face, which was a way to the deep white.
Being so closely attached, Jiang morning pain and happy reacted.
There's a lot of stuff, said Jiang, carefully looking at his side, and no hesitation in pointing at his head.
Come on, let's go upstairs, and I'll help you clean up.
When he had finished, he dragged his bath towel in front of his chest, and dragged his hand up to the stairs.
Jiang's expressions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was hot in the summers, and now it's sticky, and she can't wait to take a shower, and then to go back to her bedroom and sleep.
Until midday, Jiang began to sit down from the bed with his sleepy eyes.
The beautiful who fell asleep with him last night.
It is often said that there are only dead cows, and no cultivated fields.
Last night he worked out, with the empty body deceived the Xiu Xiu and asked for forgiveness, didn't think that the honorable woman president, the next day can climb up to work on time.
Thinking about this, Jiang shook his head and laughed, and lifted his air-conditioner, and fell onto the bed.
Hearing the sound of the bedroom, the handsome Aisha came in with her clothes, gently changed her clothes, and asked in his ears, What is the arrangement for today?
"Yes," said Jiang, rubbing Aisha's hair, "all day with you two.
Enjoying the warm hand, Aisha smiled gently and said softly, "Come with my sister, she is always at home alone, I have occasion to go out with you.
Though she rarely speaks, I can feel that she is not inferior to me in her love for you.
Looking at the clear eyes, Jiang suddenly felt a little sorry for her, opened his mouth just to say something, but was gently pointed to the lips.
Don't say anything.
Aise stood up and kissed him gently.
She looked at him with love, she stretched out her hand, and shed her tie for him.
Get ready for lunch.
Looking at the beauty that was close to her, Jiangshan's heart was a little fluctuating, unwillingly stretched out his hand to hold her waist, and he spoke softly to her ears.
Can I eat you first?
"No, you have to go to the company in the afternoon."
She put her head down and touched her chest gently with her forehead, she said softly, "Don't delay the right thing, lest my sister-in-law become jealous again.
Even though Jiangshan was sure that if he insisted, Aisha would surely not resist, but given the harmony of the vinegar bowl with the summer poem rain, he still listened to the little girl's advice.
After the two had lunch, Jiang sat on the sofa for a while, then drove to the company.
By the elevator came to the top of the building, and on the way to the door of the summer poem rain, Jiang Shun the way and greeted her.
Even though there was no expression in his mouth, Jiang had a very clear feeling when he saw himself appear here in the afternoon, the summer poem rain was very pleasant.
What she cared about was not whether she cared about her own work, she was used to doing the heavy work for her, but whether she was willing to spend more time with herself.
She didn't ask Jiang to pour in her feelings, can more than with him born to die Aisha, she only hoped in her feelings at least not to be thrown away too far...
Going into his own office, Jiang had the beauty secretary help him with a cup of coffee, by the way, to call the CEO of Futures Bank David Smith from the floor.
Soon Mr. Smith appeared before his desk.
Since it was working time, Jiang morning did not have a cold, open the door to see the mountains, said.
"Within three days, I'll see a new $15 billion in futures bank accounts that can be controlled freely.
Additionally, I uploaded the reports from Daimler BMW Volkswagen Group to my mailbox.
Yes, there are some companies in Germany that are at the top of the electrical industry.
At the end of the morning, the two words of surprise were written on Smith's face.
As a senior financial practitioner, nothing about capital internationally escapes his eyes.
Needless to say, Futures Bank is preparing for a downturn in the European economy, where liquidity is already available, and where his team is now studying is just where the profits are high, and where the success rates are high.
Daimler BMW Volkswagen are, of course, the best choices for investment.
It's just that's not what you want to buy. Even if you get a double premium, it's going to depend on whether the German government is willing to sell it to you.
But Smith did not expect his boss to be so generous that even the branches of the German automobile industry, such as Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen, could have taken over.
"No problem.
Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise
Then go.
"Yes."
After Smith left, Eang Morning took Mocca's coffee from the beauty secretary's hand, and sat on the chair and smelled her mouth.
The war is over, the money is gone, the blood is almost gone.
On the eve of victory, the stubborn Camen died in Finland, and the Communists, led by the Rothschild family, were unable to return.
It's going to be the big story of the whole war.
It's time to share!

Chapter 1080
A German man washed his luggage at a fast hotel in the northwestern city of Bremen.
Perhaps because he was too panic, he accidentally touched the phone on the table on the ground.
At his sight, he bent and picked up his cell phone, and put it in his pocket.
"That's not enough," said the old man, "that's not enough!
Oh! Oh!
While cursing, he joined the packed baggage, and walked to the door.
Karl Krupp, was a good name in the German upper class.
Now, however, he lives like a street rat, dressed in a hundred-euro-one clothing, lives in a cheap fast-food hotel, and has to go out ink and baseball caps, afraid of being recognized.
I don't know why he suddenly remembered his brother, Glenn Krupp, the man who was strongly opposed to joining the Rothschild family, who was the heart of the Krupp family.
If he hadn't been blinded by the power to remind him of Camen that night, maybe today's Krupp family would be another end.
Standing on the elevator, he shook his head hard, away from the unrealistic thoughts.
Thinking about this problem has no half what it does to itself.
Adjusting his emotions, looking at the decreasing number of floors at the elevator door, Calvert's heart was burning with a little hope.
As long as he successfully escaped to South America, where he hid for a while, waited for the winds to pass completely, and then operated through offshore companies, quietly diverted the money from his existence in the Cayman Islands, he could still continue to be rich in South America.
One billion dollars is enough for the rest of his life.
As for the Krupp family, he has two brothers and one sister, who cares who cares!
When the elevator reached the first floor, Calfter loosened his breath and walked out the door with his hand luggage.
At this moment, however, four men in black suits noticed him, and rose from their chairs and surrounded him from the four directions of the hotel hall.
Noticing himself being watched, Calvert's face flashed like a bird of the bow.
He just wanted to turn to escape, but found his way back had been sealed, and he had no way to escape.
After a few seconds, he was surrounded by four black men.
The man standing opposite him, took out from his chest a certificate, said facelessly.
Hello, are you Mr. Calvert?
Are you mistaken?
Calvert said,I'm Francis Ode, the head of a food processing company in South America, and this is just for a visit to Germany.
But the man didn't even understand his words, he continued.
"We are agents of the Federal Constitutional Guard.
You are now facing at least twenty charges of treason, Mr. Calvert, please come with us.
Calvert panicked, and crashed into the man next to him, trying to escape.
However, where he had his little board hit by a long-time sand-the man next to him did not move at all, and he controlled his hands lightly.
"No! I'm not going anywhere! I've got to get on the plane!
As he struggled for the last time, Calvert screamed, and his noses were everywhere, and the more miserable the more miserable it was.
When the agent of the Federal Constitutional Guard saw that Calvert had no intention of cooperating with him, he ceased to speak to him, gestured to the assistant next to him, and said.
Take it away.
"Yes!"
On 3 June, the German People's Liberation Front soldiers entered Berlin with no bloodshed, and the people of Berlin were greeted.
This long struggle of months came to a successful end in a month of armed struggle.
On 5 June, Ewing returned from Russia to the Prime Minister's residence in Berlin, where he ended his years of exile and, as the leader of the Communist Party of Germany, took the oath of office before the whole of the German people.
On the same afternoon, a total of 27 members of the newly elected party were prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against the federal constitution, and the maximum sentence was life imprisonment without parole.
Meanwhile, several European firms, including Rothschild Bank and Krupp Group, suspected of providing massive political donations to the new party, were prosecuted by the German government. The Supreme Court immediately frozen their assets in Germany and initiated proceedings as quickly as possible.
If convicted, Rothschild Bank fears being sentenced to a €1 trillion fine.
There's no doubt that's not enough money for the present Rothschild family.
Following the judgment, several company shares held by Rothschild Bank will be returned to Germany for auction by several banks.
The proceeds from the auction will be returned to the state treasury for the recovery of Germany's stagnant economy.
According to the agreement, Jiangshan acquired shares in the three top auto groups from within the German government at a 20% premium, replacing European conglomerates such as Rothschild as the first shareholders in the three European auto companies.
EU integration is expected to fail, and the euro continues to fall.
The euro dropped to the lowest exchange rate for the new currency, even to 1:3, to the tune of EUR 15 billion, and finally to the foreign exchange markets at a price of EUR 4 trillion.
Two trillion euros are loans from Futures Bank to the German Central Bank, One trillion euros are for the acquisition of 37% of Volkswagen, 41% of Daimler, 39% of BMW, and One trillion euros are for an interim initiative by Jiangshan, adding to investments in five electrical companies, including Siemens and Bosch.
The Future Group, led by Mr Jiang, has become the biggest winner in the ceremony of splitting up the European funds.
Both of Germany's two-pillar industries are labeled Futures.
Jiang had plans to buy the Krupp group, but this time Evelin has not spoken so well.
Needless to say, Krupp is the heart of German industry, and even if they were on the wrong side of the newly elected party, the German Supreme Court did not punish them excessively.
Moreover, the Krupps were traditional Prussian nobility, not Jewish in themselves, and did not enter the communist core.
Following the rise of the new owners, the Krubers were firmly on the side of the victors, as if they had abandoned their relations with the Rothschild family and the Communists.
Even if Evelyn did not want to go overboard, the page was revealed.
The EU integration process can not even pass a hundred days, the drama of the death of Carmen,

CHAPTER 1081
As the heart of the European Union, the victory of the Germans has encouraged the people of Europe in the heat of water.
The Fall of the Rothschild Empire hastened the “right-leaning” of European countries, and people began to reflect on whether the choices made two years ago were the right ones, and whether the far-right parties had really taken their country in a better direction.
Contrary to the turbulent European situation, the Asian economy on the other side of the globe is steadily rising.
Especially in the western Pacific, which is a vast country, GDP is like sitting in a space elevator.
On 10 June, a delegation from the Government of Japan, led by Chubu Electric and Tokyo Electric, reached an agreement on expanding electricity imports, increasing the total amount of electricity imported by 31 per cent in the second half of the year, to replace the two nuclear power stations that were suspended in the country.
Helium 3 is currently being extracted at a rate far greater than the consumption rate, and the new second nuclear fusion power plant is about to be completed, with considerable capacity left.
For such an agreement, of course, open hands welcome.
Not only in Japan, the most cherished in China market also relaxed on the policy, sent a number of power companies delegation to visit the new country.
As the world's first power utility, China's power market is larger than the second United States and the third India combined.
Even if China eliminated half of the electricity, it could make the circle trade crazy.
By early June, the global grid plan has completed the most critical first step.
With multilateral efforts, thermal cables have successfully covered 80 per cent of the countries and regions across Australia and Asia, with output accounting for 88 per cent of the total domestic output.
Benefit from cheap electricity, according to the share of imported electricity in the total national electricity consumption, the industry cost of the global grid plan member countries has fallen to 1.7%, and the lowest to 0.3%.
Don't take a look at the two drops reflected in billions of units of GDP, the energy generated is unimaginable!
This does not mention the ecological environment, the investment environment, the competitiveness of export products, the promotion of the electrification process, the weakening of domestic industry's dependence on the energy market, etc.
In short, governments who have tasted the sweets have sent out positive signals, sending entrepreneurs on their side to negotiate with new countries to see if they can expand their imports.
The New York Times even claimed that the new state was like a country on a wire.
The Washington Post had a highly satirical cartoon, with a dog chain extending from the West Pacific to the surrounding large, small countries.
No matter what the media reports, the countries that buy tickets are already on high-speed electrified trains, and to taste the sweets they have no reason to jump outside the train.
Through a submarine cable, Jiang's gains are not only a source of continuous cash flow, but also real diplomatic capital.
Why has the dollar dominated global markets for most of the century?
If your own crude production doesn't meet domestic demand, you can only reserve more foreign exchange to avoid risk.
As it is now, countries in Asia are adding new ones.
Even if Colo is not the world’s financial center, the new Fed has the potential to unleash the dollar’s dominance, as the dollar’s rise and fall are affecting industrial and household electricity costs in many countries.
It has nothing to do with finance, it is hard power.
Five Days away from the Summit on Outer Space Security, Jiangshan has sent invitations to ten major countries around the world, and implicitly mentions the topic of the meeting will be related to outer civilization.
To date, all ten countries that received the invitation indicated that they would send high-level foreign ministers to visit.
There is no longer any doubt about the holding of the meeting, and for the Jiangshan side, it is the question of what kind of evidence should be presented at the meeting.
Currently, the space telescopes he carried from the end of the world have been installed in the space elevator, sent to the synchronous orbit.
It wasn't clear what the exact coordinates of the colony were, but it was enough to know where they were coming from and where they were going.
Gliese 581 is about 2 degrees north of the planet Libra, about 20.5 light years from Earth.
As early as the week before the letter was sent, the astronomical observation team of the Department of Trade and Space carried out several days of observation of the galaxy, and finally came to an astonishing...
It's already the news for Jiang.
The probability of life on Gliese 581g is 90%.
"It is unbelievable..."
With a handful of astronomical data in his hand, he entered the office of Jiangshan, and said with an uncanny face, "Your guess is correct, there is indeed the possibility of birth.
But I can be sure that, even if there is life, there is no way that civilization beyond the Stone Age will be born.
Jiang picked up his eyebrows and smiled and asked, Oh, why?
"First of all, the tidal lock, the entire planet's habitable zone is only one of the morning lines, which determines their living space."
Then, and most importantly, the elements of this planet contain a great deal of hydrogen, nitrogen, but a great lack of mineral elements such as iron and aluminum.
Again, according to the gravity data analysis we observed, the largest of the planets is probably the existence of a group of arthropods, even mammals, along the lines of dawn and dusk!
Hearing this, Jiang nodded approvingly.
It is quite remarkable to be able to analyze so much valuable information from such limited information, despite the observations of the 22nd century.
Have you considered another possibility?
"Another possibility," said Claren.
"We have always believed that the development of civilization is linear, from the Stone Age to the Iron Age, from the feudal age to the Industrial Age.
"What's wrong?
"It is impossible to draw conclusions from only one reference system, and we cannot deny the possibility of other forms of existence because the development of human civilization is linear," said Mr. Jiang.
You're saying a bunch of insects might be breeding civilization
Calvin shook his head, and when he thought they had no hands, he suddenly froze.
He suddenly remembered the previous period of the Star circle trade's military operation against northern Finland's moss.
There, the star circle trade attracted a powerful armored journey, encountered seems to be a group of aliens climbing from insect eggs.
Why would Jian let the Department of Star Trade observe the Gliese Galaxy, why would Ji Jianan suddenly go to Finland before the X2 bacteria outbreak, why would Jiananan be so sure of the dangers of the mother nest from the start...
All of the clues were put together in Kelvin's mind.
He stared at the morning, and unbelievably pulled out a few words from his throat.
"You're saying..."
"Yes," said Jiang, nodding earnestly, "the beginning and end of the X2 bacteria is not just a research accident, as advertised by the outside world, it is from the beginning a conspiracy to alien civilization."

Chapter 1082
Leaving his office in the morning, he repeated in his mind what his boss had just said to him.
Five Days After the Space Security Summit, Star Trade will publicize to the Heads of State the existence of alien civilization, and prove its intention of aggression...
In fact the latter does not need proof.
Both values are completely different civilizations, from the beginning there is no trading option.
Since both are insects in each other's eyes, there seems to be only one way to prove who can continue to be at the top of the food chain.
That's war.
Looking complicatedly at the document in his hand, recalling the boss' assignment to him a minute ago, for the first time in his life, Kelvin felt the burden of the job on his shoulder.
After work, Jiang did not immediately go home, but alone by boat to Coconut Island.
The island had been transformed by him into a junction between the present and the future. Every month, a ship would come and unload delayed supplies, such as food and supplies, and occasionally would carry a load of solid goods sealed with containers.
These boxes contain advanced industrial machinery, the T3 motor armor, and some other high-tech products.
Although the entire island is not manned by soldiers, there is an entire U.S. drone attack battalion.
It's not that idea of the "Mysterious Little Island" has been worked out by outsiders, but by no one.
Arriving on the small island, Eang-shan tied the ship at the dock, confirmed the identity information through the reconnaissance drone, and went to the warehouse in the center of the island.
The corner of the warehouse, where the machine was taken to be called the "King of the Warehouse 1" is located.
Last time Lin passed through this machine a fat autumn rat from the present world to the last world and then passed back from the last world and viewed life from the dimension of 0.
Breakthrough 1 to 1.
Even though there is still a long way to go, this is certainly a good start.
It's just that's not what Jiang had in mind.
Going to sit by the machine, Jiang took out from his pocket several test tubes filled with ink-green liquid, put them in the center of the two disks, then put on a belt with various tubes, and opened the power supply.
Looking at the arc of the jump, he pressed the switch hard on his head.
After a long struggle, transmitting the test tube to the end of the world, Jiang morning three to five to two untie the bound hand, turn off the machine's power, and follow the past.
()
One of these tubes contains material extracted from the remains of the female nest, and several other tube tubes contain spores and insect eggs respectively.
None of the cells in vitro have been exterminated, and even the creeping of unknown substances can be seen through the ink-green culture.
After receiving these test tubes from Jiang's hands, Lin immediately entered the laboratory.
After a long wait, the door of the laboratory opened again, the re-emerging Linling called to the morning of Jiang, then brought him to a special microscope.
In addition to the tubes he had brought, he saw two similar tubes on the test bench.
From the labeled above, he quickly understood where the two test tubes came from.
"The sample you brought is not exactly the same as the one we encountered in the center, but the DNA code is very similar.
What you've encountered is obviously an upgrade, but due to poor development, many of the functions have not been differentiated.
After hearing Lin's introduction, Jiang's eyebrows suddenly twitched.
"Deformation?"
Hundreds of tungsten balls and a whole armored brigade greeted at once, and then bit the hard bone. Did you tell me it was not well-developed?
Lin nodded.
"Yes, if you give it enough organics and give it enough time to work with light, digest those organics and absorb them into its own components, the mother nest will gradually develop into a complete body.
Based on its entire DNA code, it will be an inexhaustible terror existence.
Saying this, Lin paused, and went on with a glee: "I don't think there's any way to clean it up, at least with the available technology.
Each spore cell has the ability to grow into a** nest, and the number of splits is no longer limited, unless we can kill each spore, then one day it will not know from which corner it emerges.
After listening to Lin's narration, the evolution of the mother nest made Jiangshan feel a little cold and cheerful.
For those who have completely abandoned their traditions, the Earth is a completely strange planet.
Whether it is gravity or air or magnetic field, knowing does not necessarily mean being fully adapted.
In the war with them, man first occupy the home advantage.
On this strange soil, however, their abilities have evolved at an incredible rate each time they interact with humans.
It would be difficult to say in what form the harmonious civilization would carry out its plans of aggression when the day of the colony's landing came.
After realizing the deeper seriousness of the problem, Jiang Zhen pondered for a moment, and immediately ordered.
"We organized the information of this maternity, and we focused on analyzing the genetic components of the X2 bacteria and the T-series viruses.
In addition, give me a piece of paper and an electronic file, the electronic file is best to make a common understandable full-spectrum image.
"Hey, are you when I'm your secretary?
"Ten boxes of mango."
"Well...
"It tastes like fifteen boxes of strawberries," said Lin, closing his little mouth for a moment, as if he had made a big concession.
Hearing Lin's words, Jiang laughed and shook his head.
Does this matter to him?
"I'll take you next time.
But again, don't you like mango flavor?
Lin grinned and looked at the side:
There's too much mango, and you haven't finished everything you've given me.
It is not a small task to organize all the information of the mother nest, but it is not difficult for Lin, who is an electronic.
After receiving a promise from Burton, Linling kissed her small chest and promised her that she would be well within three days.
Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go
Before coming to the end of the world, he had already greeted Aisha, and it would not have been a surprise if he had stayed to the end of the world for three days, until the information about the mother's nest had been completely arranged for Linling.
This information will be of great use at the forthcoming Summit on Outer Space Security.
If the international community can get enough attention, it is all on it.

Chapter 1083
An informal Fed shareholders meeting is taking place in the Morgan Building on Wall Street, New York.
The man sitting next to the door is the current owner of the Morgan family Daniel Morgan.
Together with him sat at the table, and the Rockefeller family, representing the Rockefeller family of the Boston Consortium.
Even the Gianni family, the owners of the California conglomerate far west, sent their own representatives.
It is not exaggerated to say that which is qualified to sit at the table, to the Americans, is nothing less than that which is printed on a hundred-dollar bill, and that which is breathable.
The people here can cause three earthquakes in the financial world.
To put it bluntly, at least one-third of the world's capital is embedded in hundreds of square feet of rooms in the region.
"First, let's win together."
Daniel Morgan picked up champagne from the conference table, lifted away, looked around, " Victory belongs to the bee, Wall Street belongs to the bee!"
The English word wasp is appropriate to the contraction of the WASP, usually the members of the WASP will also call themselves by this name.
Old Rockefeller smiled and raised a glass.
There was no more row, and under the leadership of the two big guys, twelve glasses of wine were raised to celebrate the joint victory of the WASP consortium, which was finished with Daniel's lead.
In front of the twelve, with respect, handed over the towels, and after all the big lads had used them, with the drink, took off from the meeting room.
Early, throwing the towels in the hands of the waiter, Daniel hesitated to look at the guests before the meeting table.
Of all the capitalists, he is certainly the youngest, and the most successful.
After all the waited, Daniel gave a gentle applause, indicating that everyone looked to him.
"Yesterday, Morgan Bank completed the acquisition of assets by Roschild Bank, such as shares in Citibank.
So far, I am very honored to announce to you that we have completely kicked out of this street under our feet those disgusting Jews.
There was a ceremonial applause on the desk, and even old Rockefeller gave a gentle applause, but the dull eyes gleamed with a taste.
Daniel nodded, and humbly received the praise of the WSP core members who were sitting behind him, and the name behind him.
When it comes to the Rothschild family's control over the United States, it has to do with the Fed.
As is well known, the Federal Reserve is the equivalent of the U.S. Central Bank, with a great deal of control over the “world money.”
Just throwing out a big stick for raising interest rates could leave some weak economies with their plants dry for a month or two, and their fiscal debts high, like a nuclear weapon in the financial field.
Most importantly, this nuclear weapon is in private hands.
Although members of the Federal Reserve Committee are nominated by the President and appointed by the Senate, they are strictly a federal agency.
Under the Owens Act, however, the Federal Reserve would divide the country into 12 reserve areas, each of which would establish a regional reserve bank with independent legal status.
The shares of the regions are purchased by the member banks of the regions according to their asset proportion.
Take the New York Reserve, where, according to the latest public figures, some of the biggest shareholders are Citi 15 percent, Citi 14 percent, Morgan 9 percent, Hanover 8 percent, and Hanover 7 percent, and behind these banks are often the shadows of financial families such as Rockefeller, Morgan, and Rothschild.
Goldman Sachs washed out as early as last year, and now the Rothschild family is being directly kicked out, with its shares in Cities and Hanovers being split between Rockefeller and Morgan.
If 18 Wall Street was a Jewish and Anglo-Saxon court martial, and the buttons of nuclear weapons were in the hands of two, then 19 Wall Street Street could be called the world of the WASP conglomerate.
Old Rockefeller coughed softly and pulled Daniel out of the drunkness of victory.
Celebrating the victory can be kept to the evening party, all of you, now we have more important things to discuss.
"You said.
Daniel smiled, with no expression of discontent on his face.
Without saying anything, old Rockefeller lifted his hand over his shoulder and moved his finger gently.
The Secretary, standing behind him, took the first two steps, and placed a document respectfully on the table.
Sitting a little, old Rockefeller, wearing gold glasses, reached out to open the file.
"On June 11th, Japan Electric Company and Tokyo Electric Company reached an expanded electricity import agreement with Starring Trade.
According to the year's electricity consumption in Japan last year, the Star circle trade has successfully monopolized 20 percent of the electricity in our children's country.
When this came out, the people who were sitting were looking at each other, even Daniel's eyes were shining with surprise.
"These two reports have not yet entered the disclosure process, and you may have not yet received them, and my report is due to a cabinet official.
Saying this, old Rockefeller looked at the people who were sitting, Believe me, I don't need to say more, you may have felt it too.
"We are losing control of the situation in Asia.
As soon as the word came out, the whole room was filled with laughter.
There are representatives of the major corporations, and the financial giants of Wall Street, with their intelligence and sense of smell, clearly do not see this.
It was just before everyone's energy was drawn to Europe, everyone wasting their brains trying to bite more meat from Rothschild, so that no one would ever turn their attention to the opposite of the Earth.
"The dollar's dominance is being shaken, and it may be wrong to let the Communists fall so quickly."
What can we do? Can we pull them out of the tomb?
"Maybe we can help the Krupps, as long as there are new rivals to hold the group of the future-"
It's more unreal.
Cutting off everybody's discussion, Daniel shakes his head, crossing his fingers in front of his lower jaw, already immersed in the joy of victory, now aware of the lurking crisis before the WASP, "We must balance the circle trade by continuing to expand their influence.
Bad things are happening, and we will be more and more passive if they let their global grid plan go.
"Yes," he said.
Rockefeller nodded, looking around at the people who are here, "I know that there is cooperation between the people who are here and the people who are here in many areas, but if they shake the foundations of the dollar, I think the people who are here are well aware of what that means.
Wall Street's financial empire was built on the dollar.
Wall Street giants have looted the world for nearly a century through both exchange rate and market leverage.
Once the dollar loses its “world currency” ring, central banks shut down and reduce the holding of the dollar, every note issued by the Fed will become a waste paper, and the Wall Street financial empire, piled up on pieces of paper, will become worthless overnight.
The two hours after the meeting, including Daniel, all of them came to their senses from the joy of victory.
The Jewish family had fallen, but their wolf had not yet eaten, and now the tiger was looking at the Pacific shore.
When everyone's interests were threatened, the WASP consortium, unprecedentedly united in two hours, devised a plan to circumvent and block the "Global Grid Plan" for the trading of stars.
After the meeting, the representatives of the major conglomerates rose from their seats and hurried to the outside door.
Daniel Morgan, who presided over the meeting, did not stand up, but leaned on a chair and closed his eyes.
At this moment, he suddenly remembered the guy calling him a month ago, when the old financial tycoon's Roschild family lowered their voices to ask him for help, but he refused without hesitation.
On the contrary, I am so sure that one day in the future, I will be glad to make the choice today.
His fingers touched the desk, and Daniel repeated the words he had spoken, but with a little hesitation, he was no longer as decisive as he had been.
