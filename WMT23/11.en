CHAPTER 130
"What are you doing? "The old man knocked on his hand with a voice of anger.
"Our grandfather will be here soon. please don't hesitate to do what you want.
The man who led returned.
Grandpa of the East naturally knows who the 'grandfather' means in his mouth.
He's a little confused and doesn't know why he's here.
It's not a good thing to have a party withDK, although everyone in R wants to get out ofDK, but can't at all.
It's just a thought.
After a few minutes, Pei's car arrived.
He came down from the car, and the sight shifted to the nearest car.
And little Lemon saw him, didn't pick up his mask and his hair, and came down from the car.
Wu Liang followed.
"You're here," said Ann.
Pei looked up at her, laughed hard, came to her before, approached her by a few, and said, Oh, the people look at you, too hard to guess, are you
Of course,I don't want them to know who I am, so I'm going to let you in, now's not the time.
Pei took a conscious glance at Wu, "Why are you with him?
There's something.
He straightened himself, turned himself, and said to the house, with a smile on his face, I don't know where my sister has gotten the men of your house house to want to kill her.
As soon as the family heard, the face changed instantly, Pee's sister? Where Pee's sister?
"Mr. Pee's sister... we really don't know anything."
I don't know what to say, now I tell you.
Pei said in a cold voice, Can you hear?
"Now that Mr. Pei has said that is your sister, please take your sister with you," said Mr. Pei. "As for Mr. Lin, whose name is not mentioned in my family register, but is still my family, how shall we deal with him as our family?"
Pei didn't answer, and little Liu said to him, "Brother, he's my boyfriend, and now I have his bones in my belly, and you can't throw him away.
Pei had only wanted to take her, didn't think now it's a bit difficult.
But he's kind of a bully, and it doesn't matter what he wants to do.
Grandma, you heard, this is my brother, both of whom have children, and give them to you, is it not that the children will have no father?
It was too clear to the East Palace, to take away the people, then they would not be able to deal with their grandchildren in the light, so, although some fear the power of theDK, the attitude could not weaken.
"I'm afraid that's not possible," said Mr. Pei. "We have our own family law, and no outsider is allowed to interfere in the handling of our own people."
He's the father of my sister's belly. You're old, don't you have bad ears?
"This morning, when my mother gave me a poisoned meal, I had already decided on the spot with her, before, when the family of the East were trying to design me and Miss Ann and his subordinates into an accidental death, I had already been very clear, now that the name of the East is still on the family register and the family of the East, but now I have no name of the East, now I have a name of Wu, Wu is the name I have now, I am no longer the family of the East!"
Words are generous, Words are cold.
His determination was proved when he spoke to so many people.
This is not what you say! said the old man of the East; Come into my Eastern Houses, for we are the ones who are born, and we are the ones who die!
Madame of the East, I would like to ask you, that your plan to kill Miss Ann has been known to her, and that you are here in the mood to punish me, and that you are not afraid to make a serious intervention on the side of the State of S?
She is a kind of vengeance, you want her life, can she please? Well, I don't have much to say, my time is more precious, and I've taken both of them.
Those who saw the family again, he added, If you don't want to see blood here.
Thus, the family looked at the duck had already cooked completely to fly away.
It's awful for the Grandpa and the Grandpa of the East Palace.
Finally, the old man said directly, count, count, count, count, count, count, count, count.
"We have to go back to S."
Pei glanced at her;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"I'm in a hurry to return, but I promise you a request is also true, tell me, what request?
"Well, my request may be a little difficult..."
Then don't say one makes me feel good.
Pei came over, stared at her,,You really haven't changed a bit, come with me half a month.
What kind of jury?
Same as before.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
"You've cut too much," said Pei, smiling slightly. "For five days, no less, it's about asking for, asking for, you can't say no, it's sure to give you freedom."
"Can I go back to the country first?"
No No No No No
Wu Lin stopped listening to the two talk, and really felt,the two are not one leg?
Are these two people inconsistent relationship?
Sounds like it.
But if it were, the two would have been too shy to face him.
Then let him go back to S. I'll be with you, okay?
"I'm not going to do anything to you.
His words are beyond doubt.
Don't say anything anymore.
Since it is not far from Qing, so soon arrived.
It's a really nice place to be.
Qin, when she saw her moment, was very unhappy, when they entered, she stood and turned white eyes.
Thinking about how her grandfather brought the plague back.
CHAPTER 13
After bringing in the heart and the tea, Qin asked a word, "Grandfather, this is..."
"What's your name?" asked Pei. "I remember saying it."
"I don't care," said Pei. "I'll arrange a room for him."
All right, but do you want to arrange for Miss Ann?
No.
Wu Liang confirmed his own guess, he seems to be living with An Xiao Liang.
Liu finds himself and Pei's eyes wrong, instantly realizes he must have been wrong.
I don't know why she doesn't want anyone to misunderstand her relationship with other men.
Thinking about her own man, she really wasn't.

"All right.
Out of the door, she asked in a low voice, Did you misunderstand my relationship with Pee
"Are you not?
Of course not.I usually sleep on the sofa I just sat on.I used to be locked by him and sleep on the sofa every day.
Does he like you?
"Don't talk," said An, clapping his shoulder. "We'll be here for five days.
"Good."
For a few days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Despite every day thinking of her nutrition, still a few kilos thin.
"I'm afraid I won't be with you for the next few days," said Xiao, looking at the briefing sent by An Xiao Li, to the side of Fan Blue.
What are you going to do?
Xiao didn't tell her about her double personality, and he didn't want to hide it from her, but he did know that the fewer people who knew about it, the better, "there is something important, and I will come back as soon as possible.
"I'm with you.
"Are you not going to make a show?
Come back and keep going.
Xiao reached out and touched her head, and the more she strained him, the more he relied on him, the happier he was.I also wanted you to go with me, because it was the safest time for you to follow me, but this time not.
'What are you going to do?' asked the blue. 'You didn't tell me, I didn't let you go.
Shao looked at her worried eyes, Then you have to keep it secret, absolutely not to tell anyone.
Of course I'm not going to say.
Say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run
"He's got a double," "He's got a second double," "He doesn't know where he's going," "He can't find his way home," "He's probably out of the country," "He doesn't know which country he's going to," "So I've got to call up somebody," "And," "Now," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And
"Who is the Wu family?"
Xiao explained, "The witch family of our country, they once cursed An Xiao Li and lying, then didn't know why suddenly disappeared, now found, just that the latter didn't inherit their family's witchcraft, but found a man like me, this man must know the witch, can catch better, can't catch at least can't let him live.
It felt like hearing a strange thing, Little Lemon will be okay?
"Well, it's fine, I'll come back a few days later."
Then go, I'm not with you don't have time to do anything and take care of me, I'll let my sister-in-law get more bodyguards.
Shao extended his hand to her hair, "I don't know when it will be good to speak?
"Isn't he your teacher? Why don't you call him your teacher?"
"I like it.I used to call him my uncle," he said. "I like it.I used to call him my uncle," he said. "I like it.I used to call him my uncle," he said.
I can't tell you.
Xiao took a bite of her, "I'll wait for the guard to come and go, so now you dial the number of your sister, and I'll tell her.
"All right.
Four Blue took out his cell phone and made a phone call.
"Sister," said Zhong, "I have something to say to you."
"Well," said Yo.
Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four
As soon as he heard,,I don't need so much,I just need four.
Not enough.He didn't listen.Come over now.
All right, I'll send people over now.
"Well.
Xiao hung up the phone and arranged for her, "I'm not at home these days, eat well, rest, and when I get to work, I'll get to sleep fast, don't play the phone at night, it's not good for my eyes.
"I know."
Knowing that Zhao has come to R, An Xiao Li's heart a little relaxed, hoping to find Jin's voice quickly.
Come to Qing Ping for two days, she didn't sit there with the paper crane, but sat on the wool carpet on the ground to practice yoga.
Pei Ying, when he saw her yoga moves in various forms, occasionally looked up at her glance, even if there was no communication, and felt that there was a person in the room, the whole person's spirit would be much better.
"You don't have a D now. Who's in charge?"
"BecauseDK was created by him, he is not, but no one who can be compared to him can sit in that position."
He looked at the computer and said, Will you talk to Jin about getting married again?
Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben
She would have answered him with certainty, and would have married again, but she did not know what to say when she thought of the curse.
"How can it be the same?" he disagreed. "Marriage is the best proof of a relationship between two people, two couples, and more Mrs. Chen than Miss Ann when someone calls you."
We'll be together anyway.
"Do you know why I leave you here?" asked Pee.
"Your life is too boring, and you need my spice."
Can't you be so clever?
"I can't," he said.
"That's not all the reason," he chuckled.
"Is there any other reason?"
"If you don't have a heart, I want you to be my woman."
Don't you have a clean habit?
"A really attractive woman, when she attracts the attention of a man, the other see not the things, but her nature, it is better than when I see you, automatically ignore the ones, only see yourself.
CHAPTER 13
Pei looked at her,,I appreciate you very much,I want to be a friend with you can meet often,will you?
Xiao Zheng stood up from the carpet, dressed in socks, and sat on the opposite chair of his desk, with his hands loosely resting on his shoulder, "You are the head of the D.K. department, and my other is the daughter of Mrs. S., so that two people become friends, and in the eyes of others become a group of interests," he said.
So you don't want to?
Liu looked at him, Pei, I appreciate you too, and you are very charming, I mean, not because you have said what I love to hear, you are very talented, but I have a principle, you know?
What is the principle?
"It's not a prejudice not to be friends with any terrorist organization, even if they saved me, because many so-called superficial right-for example, the East Palace family, Pei, my wish is world peace, even though I know this day may never come, even though I know it may come for a long time, but I don't want the world to have wars at the expense of the civilian population, and, I can't bear the rumors that are linked to the D.K., my parents are presidents and presidents, and I can't put pressure on them, because my identity, if it's written by some bad people, will be difficult to finish.
Pei nodded,I know what you said.
"If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If,
Thought he would say never leaveDK, didn't think he replied, "Who knows later.
After lunch, Pei had something to go, and she and Wu Lian were left in the house, where there was surveillance everywhere, although it was Pei's office, but neither of them could easily move his things.
Qin, when he saw the two were playing cards, and he himself had to bring the tea to the water service, was in the heart of indignation.
"What are you doing? Go get me some cake. I want some.
Qin said, Excuse me, Miss Ann, have you taken this place as your own?
Don't you?
Qin turned out and remembered a word in his mouth, "Eat cake eat fat dead you.
With her cake, she couldn't help saying,I don't know what our grandfather brought you back,I know what to eat and drink.
"I'm going to ask your grandfather, how do I know?" "If Miss Qin is restless, come and play with us."
Qin did not speak.
"Why don't you?
"If our grandfather had known..."
"It's okay, I'll tell him," he said.
"Well, since Miss Ann has invited me, I will be with you for a few rounds," said Qin, as he heard her say.
Anne wants to give her a word, love not play, and give you a face...
But think it's somebody else's plate.
Qin asked, Miss Ann, do you like our grandfather?
Do you want me or do you want me to not like?
I'm asking you like him
"What do I have to tell you my truth.
"If you don't like our grandfather, don't catch him. He looks cold, and he's really serious.
"Are you fishing? "Are you fishing for him? " "Are you fishing for him?"
When Qin heard this, he immediately asked again, Is It Real? Is It Real?
Do you like him?
Qin denied, "No, we are not qualified to think of our grandfather.
"Yeah, he doesn't look like you."
Qin-"
He should like two kinds of women.
Which two types?
"The first type is a simple girl without a city mind, the second type is a strong woman with a mind of her own, a woman who can look at him from the other side, are you one of them?"
Qin shook his head.
"No," he said.
"Why are you joiningDK, Miss Qin?"
"Why not? My whole family joined. Why should I leave?
Isn't it true that's what all the family is joining in? Didn't your mother leave her brain in her stomach when she gave birth to you?
"Look, isn't it what I said?"
Miss Ann, your mouth is poison.
During the five days here, An Xiao Li very quiet and very leisure.
Thought a bit tight, but okay, your feelings are the most important.
Five days don't seem to be short, but in fact a blink of an eye passes. Five days is too short for Pei.
It's too short, but he'll stick to his promise, and let him go.
An is trying to go back, but receives the depression, tells her to find Henry's trace in R.
So, the two go and Xiao will meet.
Xiao Zhong opened the door and when Wu Liang stopped, his eyes looked surprised, "It is really you.
Do We Know?
P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P
Wu stopped and looked at Li, "What happened to him?
"I've never seen him like this," he said.
Wu Lin stopped and went into the room, and when Xiao had laughed enough to shut the door, he twisted a bottle of mineral water to drink a few cups of water, "I had already guessed it was him, and it is a real life to see a real man today.
"It looks like you know who he is," I said.
Don't you have any real impression on him?
"No."
Xiao fell down on the sofa, long legs naturally spread on the tea, laughing and squinting, "The Wu family is such a talent, I naturally have some memories.
"Don't sell," he said.
"I hear it's a good friend with you."
"I've already known," said Anne. "You've been laughing for so long?I don't know where it is.
"Oh.
I laughed because I thought of the dragon and the look of the dragon thinking of death.
"What's wrong with Guang-"
"It looks like you remembered all about you and your men, and you didn't take any notice of others.
CHAPTER 13
"It looks like that's what you're saying.
"He's a lover with the old one of the Dragons.
An open eyes,You didn't lie to me?
We've had a few times with him, and we've had occasion to say that's not what he likes, it's what's around him.
Wu Lin said,Who is Yu?
"I was the girl around me. "
"What about now?"
"She's married now, and her husband's name is Long Tenze, and we're the boss of an advertising and entertainment company.
Wu stopped and said,Mr Xiao, is that girl with me before?
It's all a lover, but you're definitely not going to make it, because I know that you're dead, and that's what your Wu family did.
That's true, but that's been the past, little lemon, is she good now?
Well, her husband loved her, and had a couple, and lived happily.
"Oh, that's fine.
Wu Lian stopped looking very open,,The dust of the past, we have not met before in this life, indicates that our relationship will end in this life, she can be happy enough in this life, but, do you have a picture?
"Yes," he said.
Ann Liu opened her phone book and found a picture of her eyebrows. This is her eyebrows.
When Wu stopped looking, he smiled, "It's long and pretty.
"Yes, her daughter is super like her, is a little bag face.
"Little Lemon."
"Well?
"Don't tell her about what happened to us. Don't tell her husband. It's okay. I don't want to disturb their peace.
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
That's the right thing to say.
Didn't you find someone else?
"I've sent men to catch him and bring him back to life soon."
Xiao returned to normal, but is he special here to look for you?
Shouldn't it be?I'm not sure, but did you go to the East Palace?
I had a deal with the so-called elder, and I thought how bad it was, I fell down without a few tricks, and the people had brought me back to the country of S.
Ann Liu raised her thumb, "It's great," she said.
Win Win Win.
While Shaw was telling her about Le Blue, she said, "Your studio is supposed to train new people, and Le Blue will not be filming the play.
"It's ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready
But now I've changed my mind and I'm going to let everyone in the world know that she's my woman.
"Wowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowow
Do you know how much I have?
Five billion?
Xiao reached out to open the bottle on the table, and dropped three cups in a row, "Look at me, I'll do the cup, you will.
He lifted his hand slowly to the entrance.
Xiao Liang picked up a cup and handed it to Wu Liang. Then he picked up a cup and drank. Where did you get so much money?
"I stole it."
"Who are you kidding?
Then where do I get my money from?
Lemon stared at him for a few seconds, then Lis took out his phone, and said, Believe me, I have to inform her, I don't know what she's doing.
Xiao took hold of her arm, "I am wrong.
"A little more than a little more than a little more than a little more than a little more than a little more than a little more than a little more," he said.
"In the past, in addition to sleeping, in order to fill the heart, I have been doing business by the way, and many things have been involved, for example, long ago, our Xiao family was a business big house, and to say, I have three sisters, I am the oldest and the only son in the family, and the family has not given me, and many kinds of business have been involved, and then the bigger the bigger, until the last few decades, I have been paying attention to investment in jewellery gold, real estate, earned a lot, and the time has come to take over, and that's when I go back and tell Le Blue, she doesn't really know now.
When did real estate take over?
"The previous year."
"Captain,Captain."
"I'm looking at you are, but it's good that you're picking up on time. Some businessmen will never pick up on time.
"How much do you make? "I've recently started my business in S, and it's a real problem not to have one.
Where are you now?
"Y Country, every few decades, I have to reset my account and log in again. I just have to move my account abroad.
An Xiao Li turned to stop Wu Lian, "What do you plan for your future?
"I don't think about that much for now.
"You can now think, without listening to him," "Have the master of the East Palace, Wu, returned to the State of S?" "I believe that the people over there will soon come and find me at home, and they will certainly believe that I am doing it, and that I will bring your matters by the way, so you can now make plans for your future."
I want to find a woman like me and I like to have a safe day together.
There will be.
The three men were waiting for the news of Xiao's hand, and after two hours, finally returned the specific traces, saying that they were supposed to capture him back, but because they couldn't uniform him, let him run, at this time, they could only get away from the hotel.
Henry pulled off his mask when he saw him in the shadow.
Henry of the distance suddenly, the whole person turned to see her.
And little Lemon ran towards him, and he stood there without moving.
Don't you don't break? Why not listen?
"I just feel so bored at home," he said.
You can't take anyone you want to go to.
Anne tried to reach out to hold his arm, but was pulled out without any trace, "all around me, like a suspect.
CHAPTER 13
And little Lemon, holding his arm, so as not to be anxious to run, but to be afraid of you, to find you quickly.
Why is he here?
It's not for you.
Henry didn't say anything else, and went with her to the depression.
When Henry finds out, Fan Xiang finally gets his breath out.
He rubbed ther of the sun, From when he ran away, till now, his nerves really hadn't stopped for a moment.
After resting for a moment, Huang called to come.
Captain, you're looking for me.
"I'll take you to the office and I'll go right there.
"Yes," he said.
Fan took a shower and changed clothes before going out.
He hasn't seen the sun since he entered the basement.
At this time he appeared very confused, completely unlocked state and appearance.
"No one can count our grandmother, because you were a high school student with our grandmother before, this time our grandmother said, "I'll spare you this time.
The man who was in custody with Xi immediately relaxed his hand.
Zheng himself straight, also know that is not the time to be brave, nothing to say out the door.
"Captain," said Xiao, "how did you release him? Didn't all the cops have to be put to death?
"As grandma told me," he said, "but he's not like those who were sentenced to death."
"He's the most coerced of the first offenders, and he's nothing but a lesson," said Van. "And the other seventy-eight people, who are members of the East Palace family who have arranged for special intelligence to be collected in the State of S, are very serious in our country.
Captain, have you done your hair? Have you taken a bath?
"Well, what?"
This bath has changed clothes again. Xiao Huang touched the bottom of the bath and asked, Captain is going to have an appointment?
"What," he laughed, "I understand that it is a deadly psychological injury for you to see someone go on a date.
Captain, can you not put salt on the wounds?
"Okay, I'm gone. " Van Seong looked at the time and went out.
When I returned to find Henry no more to this day, during several Wuping Yang date him, all he pushed, saying that he was busy, not time to go out with her date.
So now suddenly had a little time, he naturally wanted to fill her.
He is going to find her now.
I didn't call her directly because I wanted to buy a gift for her.
Thermal Hospital is thermal hospital in the city.
Fan's hand had a box of red roses, which he bought for his girlfriend because he thought girls loved flowers.
After going upstairs and seeing the signs of the oral department, he passed by with the gift box.
Take Ping Yang is wearing a toothbrush to a teenage boy, not to see him come in.
When the other doctors saw it, he smiled and greeted, Is it Captain Fan?
"Hello."
Hearing his voice, Wu looked up at him, and at the moment of joy, he said, I'll be right now, you sit first.
"Well," said Van, sitting down, and finding that all the doctors and assistants around him were staring at him, he felt uncomfortable.
It was Fan's first time to see his girlfriend at work. She was wearing a white jacket, wearing a blue mask, and she was working hard.
White adds some charm.
When she was done, looking at the envy of all the female colleagues around her, she felt that she had a particularly refreshing face, and immediately took off her mask and her white coat.
"The last few days have been busy, so now I have time to see you and buy it for you.
Take Ping Yang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well, it should be.
"Well, I had a half-holiday for you, and my family wants to see you.
Take Ping Yang washed over the lid of the gift box, and then a hand handed to him, "We go out and say.
"Well.
They went out together, said Fan, Did your family ask for me?
"Well, let me ask you when you are free to have a meal with you at home," I told them, "you were busy a few days ago."
Then go home this afternoon and eat at home in the evening.
She was most afraid he would refuse, because she had sworn that he would surely go before her foreigner.
All right, I'll call my family now.
"All right.
Wu Ping Yang Lima called his family to announce the news.
After hanging up the phone, she said to Fan, "It's going to my grandfather's house. Do you want to bring some presents?"
"I don't think well yet.
"My foreigner likes the most famous brewery in B. I forgot the name, it's an English name, and it's very fragrant, it's a blue liquid.
"Yes, that's what I've been talking about, and when you go to give him this, he's happy to keep it."
That...................................................................................................
The first time a woman's family came, of course, with presents, which he knew, but with such an expensive present, he felt that it would give the other the illusion that he was a rich and well-paid brother.
In fact, he was not a rich brother, although he had a car and a room for a month and a salary of 20,000, but he was not from the same place as the dragon and the dragon's house and the dragon's house.
His parents were working in the old house, and every day was very hard.
Hearing his words,Wu Ping Yang was a little unhappy at once.What about a bottle of twenty-one thousand?I can drink for a long time.What is wrong with respecting his old man's house?
"There are many ways to respect the old man.
"I'll look after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after
Wu washed, she asked,What do you want to buy?
"I'll see you in the afternoon.
CHAPTER 13
Wu did not dare to provoke him easily, and did not say the thing again, "This time the main members of our family will probably come together, you go not to be obedient.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
"It's mainly my cousin who wants to see you. My mom says she'll arrange for a meeting at her cousin's house.
Take Ping Yang gave him a warning, "If my family is talking about marriage... what are you going to say to them?
As long as we're here, we'll get to know each other, and it won't be too late to talk about getting married.
Take Ping looked at his head, Then where are we going now?
Where do you want to go?
"Let's go to Vine."
"All right.
He took him back to the Vine, and as soon as she got out of the car, she glanced at the master house, "Sheng, can you take me to see? I would like to know what the house of Mr.
Fan was a little hesitant. Generally, we don't allow anybody to go to his house unless he's allowed or his friends, but since you're my girlfriend, you can't go upstairs unless you look at the living room.
In order not to trouble him, she cleverly pointed, "Well.
Fan went by with her hand, just to the door, looking inside the scene, Wuping Yang shouted, "Wow, really cool!
"Come in," he walked in first.
Take Ping Yang followed him, look left look, last time here only went to his place, completely dare to come here look.
It's so luxurious to see her heart beating. If she's lucky enough to live in a house like this, she'll die too!
After looking, she wanted to look upstairs, but couldn't resist, after all, she had promised him.
Out of here, asked Wu in a low voice, Seong, who saw that aunt just now?
"She's Aunt Chen," "she's in charge of the kitchen," "she's really good at cooking."
That's what it is.
Immediately after noon, Fan, asked her, Will I eat here or take you out to the restaurant?
Here, don't worry about going outside.
"What do you want to eat?" he asked again.
"Do you have anything to eat?" Wu looked up, "I want to eat something good."
If you can satisfy you can satisfy.
"I'd like a red wine and a steak.
Fan Xiang nodded,Well, I'll go to the kitchen and tell you to wait for me in the office first.
"All right.
As she listened, she went to the office, and Van was in charge of the kitchen, and by the way, she made a phone call to Ann.
At this time,R is in the middle of the night,And little lemon is not sleeping at this moment.
"Grandma, have you slept?"
"No, what's wrong with Seung?"
Fan thought to say,Today my girlfriend let me go to her house for dinner, what gift will be good when I go?
"How can I prepare two for her parents?
It's not just her parents.
"It's about me going to her home," said Fan, coughing.
Don't see your parents first, go to her foreigner's house, that's the present to be prepared, too simple is not good, after all, her parents, her uncles, her foreigner, and so on, I don't think to talk about marriage and marriage that step, it's better not to see her relatives first.
"Today," she said, "she likes to drink Blue Ocean, so let me buy him a bottle of this," she said.
"How unreal is this girl," said Anne with a smile. "How long have you been friends with men and women, and have not been married, and now it is not necessary," said she. "You go to the cellar and bring to the outsider a bottle of twenty-three thousand wines, and see how many of her uncles there are, and bring some more good cigarettes, and by the way bring her father's too, one, one, one, one, one.
You don't have to buy in our house, it's been quite a lot, normal people, men only buy hundreds of thousands of things, you are tens of thousands, it's almost.
Fan thought she had reason, "Well, thank you, grandma.
Remember to wear the proper dress when you go.
"I know."
Hang up the phone and Fan is ready to go.
Pack it in a special gift bag.
Then I took it to the office.
Take Ping Yang saw him carrying a gift bag and hurried to ask, "What?
"The wine and the smoke prepared for you and for your uncle and for your uncle."
"What about my mother and my uncle?"
"Nobody needs to buy," said Fan. "It's not about getting married, it's about getting it."
"How can a man buy not a woman? What do you want my aunt and mom to think, and it's the first time you've come in, how can you be sober?"
"How do you do it? These are worth 50,000. Is it worth 50,000 gifts for the first time? It's already quite expensive.
asked Fan, "Will I bring ten thousand gifts for the first time?"
Take Ping looked at him with his lips, "You don't care about me at all, I don't want you to give my mother and my uncle tens of thousands of gifts, but at least buy something to say
"Well, I'll go buy some gifts on the way.
According to the ordinary little boy, at this time already gone, but she knows this can not break, otherwise her family can not easily forgive her.
"Well," he said,"I'm hungry."
"I'll take you to dinner.
"Yeah.
For the first time Fan went to the home, somehow, he did not feel good about the people he loved, the foreigners, the parents, the uncles, the uncles, always felt that their eyes were too exposed, and when they looked at him, it seemed that they wanted to say something, what they were expecting in secret, he could see.
His personality wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They didn't even know how to avoid. First, they asked about when they were going to get married, and then they asked about a lot of things that they couldn't touch.
CHAPTER 13
Take Ping Yang looked a little disappointed, felt a moment of light on his face, said Fanxiang, a small voice beside him, "What does the foreigner ask you, you can't follow the heart of his old family? You don't say anything, it's funny.
"They always ask me what I can't say, what I can do, what I can't say, that's my rule.
"It's not going well," said Wu. "I don't feel like the kind of man he imagined.
"What do you mean?" said Fanxiang, who, in that instant, had caught a look of impatience from her face.
"Nothing."
Van Zhen wanted to walk, but thought came all, and endured until the night.
During dinner, the people on the table always respected him.
Even though he drinks a lot, he is inevitably drunk.
He put another hand saying he could not drink anymore, he had come by car, but Wu Ping Yang's uncle said that when he returned to give the others to drive, he couldn't afford their enthusiastic drink, he drank one after another.
Finally, his stomach was so sick that he decided to stop drinking.
As the left hand, he has always observed one of his own norms, in such an environment, absolutely can not leave himself without personnel.
Otherwise, it is easy for you to be inactive.
His concerns were true, and when Wu's mother made him go to sleep directly at his home, he immediately woke up for a few minutes, not even to say no.
No matter what his family said, he refused resolutely.
When they saw him,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Take Ping Yang rode with him, the car returned to Vine.
Van Zheng leaned on the back of the chair and kept his eyes closed.
But he didn't completely lose consciousness.
When it was time for home, Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai together lifted him from the car, he squinted to Wu Ping Yang said, "You go back..."
"You've been drinking a lot. I'll stay with you."
Sister,we are here.we'll take care of you.
Xiao said, he just said exit, Xiao Huang took a shot at him, "What do you say?
Wu, thinking of himself as a pure girl in front of Van Xuan, pointed at the head, re-entered the car, and told the window, "to give him some wake-up soup."
All right, sister.
When he saw the car went, said Xiao Huang, the sister willing to leave what you do to let her go, you fool.
Didn't you see my captain let her go? That means my captain doesn't want her to stay here.
Xiao Huang asked Fan, "Captain, why do you drink so much?"
"I've been drinking..." "I've been sick in my stomach..." "I've been sick in my stomach..."
He,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Little White called to clean up, and little Huang brought him back into the house.
Go get the kitchen to wake up soup, give him to drink the two people go.
Fan Xiao slept for two or three hours, and when he woke up, besides the pain of the head, the drunkenness was much less, and did not want to sleep at all.
He got up and washed and got out of the door with his clean clothes.
It is now ten o'clock.
When it was time for the night, to see him get up, he made a harp, "Captain, how did you get up?
"He's got a headache. "He's got a dull voice.
"You know I'm not going to let my sister go, let her stay with you, you're not going to sleep, and you're going to sleep.
Little White stared at him, Right, Captain?
Don't yell at your sister.we haven't gotten married yet.What's the matter?My grandmother hasn't gotten married to my grandmother, haven't yelled directly at my grandmother.
"Isn't it a day? " "I don't think you're going to sleep," said Fan.
"Yes, captain!" Xiao shivered, his eyes wide open, striving to beat up his spirit.
Fan Xiang extended hand grasped the mouse, scanned the subdition monitoring.
When he looked, he found his house still lit.
That's all. why isn't she asleep?
"How are you doing with Miss Mu these days?"
It's good, but Miss Mo won't let us serve her.
"Well," asked Fan. "Why?"
Miss Mo said it was very difficult for us to give her three meals a day, and we hoped that we would give her one meal, and that she would be able to cook for herself, and that she would be able to send us some time by the way, so today we had gone to fill up the fridge, and it was nearly enough for Miss Mo Mo Mo to eat for two or three days.
Fan Xiang said a no, and turned out of the office.
It rained outside.
He went out of the big door to his own house.
After pressing the password, Fan Xiang entered slowly, even the sound of closing the door seemed slightly.
When he reached the door of the second bedroom, he knocked the door, and there was her voice, Who is it?
Me.
"Come in."
Fan, pushing the door, found she was sitting on the bed embroidery, "Why not rest?
"I can't sleep.
The late man smelled of wine on him, Did you drink?
Have you taken a shower, brushed your teeth, have you smelled?
"It's light, but it smells good, and it looks like a lot of it."
"I went to your house this afternoon, and ate there at night, and don't let your family get drunk."
Mo put his hand embroidery on the table.
"No," said Ping, "I'll go if you want to see me."
Must have spent a lot of money?
"It's Grandma who got me a bottle of 20,000 wines and a few expensive cigarettes from the warehouse.
Take a deep breath, Captain, do you like Ping?
Fan, staring into her eyes, should like.
She didn't want to have more mouth, but she didn't want to hurt anyone who was good to her. She should have been married to you, as all of her parents, except for my mother, had hoped, and, to be precise, my grandfather had hoped very much. She wasn't completely true to you.
When she said this, her hands were always holding their cushions, but the tone was very gentle.
"It's all a matter," said Van. "I'm not going to get married now," he said. "I'll get to know more about each other and then make decisions."
CHAPTER 13
Mo smiled gently, Captain is so good, Ping will see your good.
"Do you really feel good about me?"
Nature is the best man in the world for me.
Fan never thought she had used the word world, with a smile in her mouth, "I'd rather not have the sun, what about you?
Mo looked at him, captain.
Fan, looking at her likeness, suddenly laughed out,Are you frightened?
"It's late," said Mo. "Let the captain go and rest. I'm in trouble."
Fan smiled,,,,,,,,,,Goodnight.
"Goodnight."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The door was also shut.
She reached out and touched her face.
She had his jokes true, and did not feel any shame at all.
How can you not tell jokes?
Isn't that stupid?
He is the boyfriend of Ping, later is his cousin.
With the three words of his cousin, his eyes were dim, and when she was injured, he would still return to his home.
After all, she can't always hide in a room without going out, she'll have to earn money to pay the debt.
Those Who Love will find her soon.
Just thinking about those things will make you feel like you can live here right now without having to worry about eating or about everything.
She always wanted a warm home.
So it doesn't matter if the boyfriend doesn't have money, she just wants to be good to her, she's willing to work with him on their future.
Now, nothing.
Her hopes were wiped out.
Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu
It was dawn when Ann, Henry, Wu Lin, and Xiao Zhong returned.
Returning to the Vine area, foot on the land here, I felt full of security.
She's taken this place as her own, no, this is her home.
After arranging a room for Wu Lian and Henry went upstairs.
As soon as she entered the bedroom, she kicked the slippers on her feet, pushed to the big bed, and lay heavily on the soft bed.
Have you been asleep so long?
"No, I'll take off my makeup, put on my mask, and sit down and think about what to do next.
Henry went to the bath, and as soon as he came out in the bath, she was lying on the bed, with her legs up, and with her mask.
He wiped his hair, came to her make-up, and began to use her protective skin.
"Your skin is better than mine," he said.
"Are you going to have to wait until you're old?"
"You're not going to get old, you're going to live a long, long time, so don't worry about this.
He's just joking.If I wasn't old,you'd be in trouble.I've been so young,you've become a wrinkled old lady by the age of seventy-eight.
Her eyes shimmered as she heard his disapproval. Then you'll be disappointed, because I won't ever die.
It's such a good wish.
"Is it true what I said?"
Oh, really.
It's true!
He walked on his face, pointed at her head, with his mouth full of digression, "It is all true.
When he saw that he wanted to sit down, he stretched his legs and placed them directly on the side of the bed.
He sat directly on her leg.
"Oh," said little Lemon over, kicking his neck with another foot, "The bed is mine, sleep on your sofa."
Have you written your name?
"If you lie here, I will touch you.
Nevertheless, as long as you don't want to be dumped on the wall again, he pushed his lower leg aside and lay down.
"Henry, you're up to it, up to it."
The rabbit jumped to the wall.
He went downstastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastasta
He wanted to shrink his hand, and the next moment of pain was put into her mouth.
Henry stared at her,What are you doing to me?
Drink your blood.
Neuropathy.
And little Lemon took his hand out of his mouth, and the tube went to lie on the bed again.
Henry lifted his hand, looked at the glow of the mouth water, showed a disgusting look, sat down to wash his hands before coming out.
It's awful.
"Why don't you kill yourself?"
That's what's called awkwardness?Ann, laughing in a strange way, approached him.I'll tell you something even more awkward, and you promise to be silent for a minute.
"Don't listen.
Listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen
He didn't feel good, so he decided to refuse, but his refusal didn't make any difference, because the person who wanted to say it would say it anyway.

Henry's face was about to turn into a tomato.I don't believe you are talking.
And little Lemon went down to the bed and went out.
Ten minutes later she came back.
Take your cell phone to bed, don't believe me, I'll give you a look at the monitoring.
Henry was at this time both contradictory and curious.
Just as she put her cell phone in her hands, a man ran to the bathroom.
He looked at him with a smile, and whispered, Don't believe me, bar of evidence.
Henry had no idea that was what his body would do, making him unbelievable and seemingly unable to stand in front of him for a moment.
He knew that body must have had many contacts with An Xiao Li, because children are the best proof.
But I didn't expect him to kiss her. And to allow her to film!
Their heads were blown up at this moment.
He quickly removed the video completely and then stared out.
And little Lemon stretched out his hand, and put it in her hand, and did not want to say a word.
When she saw him erase the video, she did not hesitate to say, "The video was on my computer, and I copied it.
"Are you going to get a computer expert out of you and let the world see?" he looked at her, a little worried.
CHAPTER 13
"Of course not, but this is a video that came from a time when I was in a rush, and it was saved in a secret file on my computer, but it was deleted just when I was copying it, to make you nervous."
When Henry listened to her words, he was relieved to see that his body had an indescribable relationship with her, but he had no impression, or even no idea, of what it was like.
"It'll be fun."
Isn't that's normal?And little Lemon looked at him with a hand up against his head,Do you want to continue sleeping or get up?
What about you?
I'm not sleeping.I'm going to get up soon.
Then get up and I'll go to sleep.
Dreams are full, reality is fragile, Henry wants to come to sleep, but fails.
At the time of dinner, all the people were sitting, Wu Lin stopped because he was in the other's house, so nobody else seemed to be at home, he was a little restrained.
While everyone was eating hi, the dragon came humming a little song.
Hey, my dear friends, I'm here.
Shao saw him,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What are you doing here?" said Henry.
Of course I think of you!
Roll.
"I haven't eaten yet, let me have one, Aunt Chen, let me have two chopsticks."
"Yes," he said.
This is the dragon in front of the friend.
Dragon took the chopsticks from Aunt Chen and sat down with pleasure.
Who is this? he looked up and stopped at Wu.
Hi, I'm Wu.
As soon as his words came out, Wu stopped.
He remembered the name of the dragon and looked at him.
When he saw his eyes falling on his own, he laughed and said, Why do you look at me?
Wu stopped laughing,No, look at you like a good man.
When a man boasts about himself, the dragon's mouth cracks, Of course, I'm the first good man in S, isn't it?
"The cows have been blown away by you," Henry said unkindly, "and the self-lovers are forgetting their own names."
It's a fact, sister, you say, am I not good for us? What do you not listen to her, she said, one I don't say two, she said to the west, I certainly don't say to the east.
"Well," I admit, "the dragon really didn't say anything to him."
"It's not the first good man in S, but at least it's a good man in front of the ocean.
"You hear me, little man."
Henry can't sit down and eat.
At the end of the breakfast, Xiao was brought by Wu's elder, Wu Hai Hong, and afterwards asked An Xiao Li, "He should be more powerful than the witchcraft, but in fact there's no witchcraft, but I think if he's good at it, he should be able to remove the curse of your lying, do you have a good way to make him willing to go out?"
"It's only a life," he said, "but he doesn't want to live, and maybe he has a number in his heart, and he won't even help us get rid of the curse, after all, to get rid of the curse, he doesn't know the birth of the eight words I've been lying to, he knows how we're going to get him to live again," and so that's not going to work, so it's better to exchange it in another way.
Shao listened,What?
"Their family changed their name and moved to the country of R. I'm well aware that for a family it is extremely difficult to change one's original name, so the descendants are more important than anything.
Xiao Zhong agreed with her, "You're right, so do it, whatever his family is, what's the difference with ordinary people if there's nothing you've been good at?"
Little Lemon nodded,I'm going,you wait here.
"Well.
When An Xiao Li went to the opposite, Long Tian Ze and Wu Lian stopped talking in the living room, didn't see the face of Yan.
Little dragon, what about the ocean?
She went to the studio early. Didn't she pick two boys and one girl at school?
She nodded,Well, what are you two big men talking about?
"I'm not talking.I'm talking about men."
"I find this Wu brother is very humorous," said Ron, laughing.
How could she not see that Wu stopped being funny?
"Yeah, sister, he's funny."
When will Yo return?
Come on, she's gone without breakfast, saying she'll come back for dinner.
Look at the time, and sit straight, "Len stop, you know, Tenze and Yang Yang's daughter and my son ordered a doll.
Wu stopped and said to me, but such a small engagement is something of the tradition.
"I really like our little meatpacks," "and they're really cute," "and they're really long," "and they look like they're really cute."
Dragon Danze had a proud face, and his eyes danced. That's it, that's my careful heart, you don't like it, but you can't.
When he says his little cotton coat, look how happy he is.
Wu stopped smiling and said,I see you are very happy.
Of course.
An is a little reluctant, I said, can you both call it?
Are there any problems?
"Of course there is a problem, you call him Wu brother, I don't know if you think you're saying 'no chest', and when Lian stops you call him 'Long brother', I don't know if you'll be mistaken for calling him 'Long chest', you two are so great, it's only the first time you meet, know... because they don't have any chest to go to Long?
When they heard her analysis, they both laughed involuntarily, which they had not really thought of.
Half an hour later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She was wearing jeans and a white sweater, carrying a bag.
"I'm back," he said.
Ann, my wife, is a friend at home.
"Who are you?" "Who are you?" "Who are you?" "Who are you?"
After a glance, she doubted, This is...
"It's my friend," said Wu. "It's your first time to meet people today."
Mei smiled into the room,,He's grown up.
CHAPTER 13 If You
Wu stopped looking at her, though I really can't remember anything about her, but always felt at her separate kindness.
"Hello."
"Hello," said Yang.
When he came back from this house, he looked at Wu Lian's constant calm, and asked, "What do you feel

"I can feel that her husband is really a good man, living with such an optimistic man, it is difficult to have a bad life, I am relieved and happy, as for my future, I want to be relieved for the days to come, to find a girl who will bring me happiness, but to meet a good girl, first of all, to go to more places of girls is the opportunity," said Wu.
"That's the point," agrees Anne.
Not long after returning, Wuhai port was brought forward.
And little Lemon looked at the man in front of him, looking at the age of three and forty, not at all old.
Hello, Mr. Wu, I believe this is someone you are familiar with, who used to be the same as you.
He lifted his eyes cold, He is not worthy to be my Wu family.
Oh.......................................................
"Do you include him?" he said to Wu.
"No, he's changed to Wu, but he's no longer your family, SO, not including him, Mr. Wu, what do I look like now?" "You should be clear about this," said Mr. Wu. "A great nation in R is not worth anything," said Mr. Wu. "A bomb thrown over will probably kill a lot of people," said Mr. Wu. "The nation in R is still in a state of instability, and the situation is in turmoil, so now you're either going to remove our curse, or you're going to protect your people," said Mr. Wu.
"How can I believe you won't go out and talk?" he asked.
"You have no choice now.
"Do you think I have forgotten that your people are planning to put me to death? A man who is a giant who is trying to kill another country, and I am, do you think our country will seek out the State of R? As long as I think I have a lot of ways to make your family do twice as much, and to finish killing, you must want to take a look at it."
Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu
Indeed, if his life were to die, if the whole family were to die, he would be a sinner of the Wu family, and after his death would see how the old ancestor had risen up.
This time, it's really thorough.
"Sister Liu," I said, "I've heard that the play of the well kills, and I'm leaving today."
"What's the difference between killing his play and killing blue? "FallBlue, with his red lips, rubbed them gently on his lips. "Besides running faster in the group than when I first joined it, and when I heard the director say that many of his plays were done for him, and that the man in the fifth play was so often used for him, I don't think it would work in his brother's group.
"It's natural that's what I'm asking for, and it's not possible to allow him to be replaced so often."
"Yes," said Xiao, "When will my brother-in-law come back?"
Come on.
"Oh, I'm hungry. My cousin was thinking about buying you all kinds of delicious things every day.
" Snacks.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
"Oh," said Xiao with his bags behind her, and the many guards outside the door looked at her and followed her.
It's a bit like a queen.
You know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just walk past, a long line.
At the time of the television campaign, the meeting.
Most of the attendees are female fans, her fans, at a glance you know there are few.
After all, although she is a little known, but still with Yan love announcement, in the work, neither TV show, no fan anywhere.
But she didn't know that wasn't just a few, it was actually a dozen.
Hundreds of people come and are really...
The activity was about half an hour, and was about to end, but there was an accident.
When he was going down, it was the closest to the person who came, at this time, there was a fifteen-year-old big tree that jumped straight up, he was not a normal jump, because the bodyguard was by the side, he jumped straight in from under the bodyguard's arm, and with one hand he caught him.
At this moment, the scene is a mess.
Four Blue fell directly onto the body of the bodyguard.
The outside bodyguard almost unconsciously pulled her away, like lightning, and directly dropped her on the ground, all retreated, the fifteen-year-old uncle fell not lightly.
Full Blue was still a little shaky, but she was still calm and left quickly.
He wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!

Xiao, seeing her not speaking, thought she was in a bad mood, hurried to soothe, "Sister Liu, it's okay, didn't you see our bodyguard brother throw the old head out?
Xiao, what do you want to do next?
Little Delighted to see her ask, a little dismayed, "Well, what do you want to do next?
"I want to continue to work with you.
"What if I quit the entertainment?
Xiao looked at her. Then I'd like to follow you.
"If I quit the entertainment world, you can't follow me," "Isn't your home a lot more common?" "You once said that your biggest wish now is to have your own house in City A, right?"
"Well, but now house prices are so high that I can't afford a few thousand dollars a month.
How many deposits do you have now?
"More than 30,000."
How about your sister buying you a room house?
Sister, this is not possible, the cheapest house in one room is one or two million, and I have not been with Sister for so long, is not it, Sister Blue you are so good to me.
CHAPTER 13
Don't you
"No," answered Xiao. "You don't make money," said Xiao. "It's hard to make money," said Xiao. "You'll stay alone," said Xiao. "I'm sure one day I'll make enough money to pay for it."
Without saying anything, when she returned to the hotel, she sat alone on the bed browsing the internet.
It's not too long, but it's been about a year.
It's almost every day with her evening, and it's not going to be like this anymore when she's out of the entertainment.
She wants to do something for little pleasure.
After all, she was always very good to herself, caring for herself, caring for herself.
When the doorbell rang, she had a look at several neighborhoods.
There was a guard at the door, so she didn't look at the cat's eyes, but she opened the door, and saw the man at the door, whose blue eyebrows were full of laughter, "Are you back?
"Yeah. "He entered the door and closed it with his hand.
He hugged her and walked toward her.
"Looking at the house.
"Look at the house," said Xiao, placing her on the bed, and looking at the notebook on the bed table.
"One room," he couldn't understand, "it's better to have a bigger house.
"It's not for us, it's for the little ones."
Xiao took off her shoes. She had money to buy a house.
Of course I want to buy her.
He sat beside her, extending his hand over her shoulder, But which one do you see?
"Look, this, and this," she said to him one by one, holding the mouse.
"I think the three bridges are good, and the wind is good," he said. "Yes," he said. "Isn't An Xiao Li's house there?
When she saw that was right, she decided to do it, and after remembering how the owner had contacted her, she asked, "If we don't want our house to be properly housed, we'll have to wait for a while before it's finished, and after it's finished, we won't be able to stay on our horses, and we'll have to dry it for a few months."
"It doesn't take so much trouble to renovate," he said. "It's easy to buy a house that's been fully renovated," he said. "I've asked Captain Fan," he said.
"The villa," asked the blue, "is it like the house of the sisters?"
Almost.
"Then buy it."
"All right.
"I washed away by an old man while I was at the event today.
When she saw the light of his eyes lit up, she said, Fortunately, our bodyguard was also a bodyguard, and he was thrown out in the next second.
After taking away the computer and the desk, he sat down next to him, and faced him with earnestness, and said, honestly, did you think of me these days
"I don't think about you, think about the little dog.
She pretended,You're the little dog.
He lay down with her.I am a little dog.You are a woman sleeping with a little dog.

"It's all done," said Mr.
Almost, but it's funny.
He turned, Let me tell you.
"Well, I'll wash my ears and listen."
Hospital. Ann and Henry are at the hospital to see Father.
Hearing Fan's father had awakened, and had nothing to do with it, all he had to do was rest in the hospital, Henry didn't think of it, and it was little Lemon who wanted him to come.
As the two entered the hospital, while his father was looking at the papers, when he saw the two of them, he nodded, "It has been so many days, that you, the son, have come to see me, and have spoken in the past?
Henry said,It's hard to see you, but what do you think?
It's hard to say, I'm your dad!
You know that's my dad Henry's coldness doesn't mean he's too much.
His father wasted his breath, and put the newspaper on his bed.
"Uncle, how are you?" asked An, dropping the fruit.
"Well, it's much better.
It's been uncomfortable for a few days, and he didn't come to see you, but he remembered you, and he said, "Uncle, can you not go to the casino? I remember you never went to the casino before, and if you feel bored today, you can go to those who are about the same age as you, and take part in some kind of entertainment, which is more realistic."
"What is good about those you don't know?
It doesn't mean.
"Yes, but it's interesting to lose money.
Henry said,I'm lying in the hospital.I can't bet.
Don't you're not happy with me all day?
Henry didn't say a word, grabbed an little lemon's arm, twisted his head and went.
When he came to the door, he loosened her arm and said, I said before that you should not come to see him.
"Your dad's in the hospital, and you don't want to get in somebody's mouth and say something you can't hear," he said.
He was very reluctant to come to see him, and I would rather go to see the wealth and riches of the house.
"Okay, look, let's go back."
After all, coming to the hospital is to have seen the father.
But there's still a place to go.
When he saw that direction was not to the Viney area, he asked, Where are you going?
"Go to the devil training camp."
He didn't say anything else. He lets the car go to the devil's training camp.
On the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The kids like it.
It's been an hour since we got back here.
Wu had promised to remove the curse for them, only to wait for the day of the birthday, October 16.
It'll be here soon, and it won't be long.
As a result, Wu Hai Port was temporarily detained.
She had a special enquiry about Wu Lian's stay abroad. She was thinking about transferring her account to the country of S, but she didn't think about selling it directly there.
He went to the public security office to apply for his own account.
Since he's been greeted, he's been there.
Come back and find that little lemon is drinking coffee waiting.
"I almost forgot one thing.
"What?"
There's one thing you didn't answer to me, and that's that you first told the people on your side that they wanted my hair.
When it comes to the question, he is somewhat uncomfortable.
CHAPTER 13 If You
"I didn't mean to tell you, but I had a very bold idea when I saw that painting.
What's your idea?
"I'd like to make a diagnosis of your hair to see if I have any blood ties.

"That's why I didn't tell you," he said.
"It's not very uncomfortable.
As her voice dropped, a little green voice came out of the door, "Grandma, the family of the East Palace abroad are here, just outside the big door.
It'll come sooner than I expected.
Let them in.
"Yes," he said.
"Do I want to...?" he asked.
"No, what to avoid, and fear they won't succeed?"
"No," he said.
And little Zi shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake
"Okay, Grandma."
Those who came were some of the sons and some of the grandchildren of the Grand Master.
With no exception, the East Palace family are the most respected, and are all men.
"Please sit."
Sixty-one of them sat down, and the first to speak was the eldest son of the old lord of the East Palace, "Miss Ann, the purpose of our coming here is first to apologize to you, and secondly, to hope that you will let our father go.
"I'm sorry, but I've left your father. What's this about? I don't know your father. Who is he? What's his father? What's his name?"
Wu didn't think she'd denied it directly, seemed to guess why she did so, and didn't say anything, sat there quietly.
It's just that some of the men of the East Palace were just a little confused, and she didn't think she'd denied it.
Miss Ann, we know that is where the elders are.
"Is there any evidence?"
A few looked at each other, but we are sure that is where you are.
"I'm sorry," she said. "I'm sorry," she said. "I'm sorry," she said. "I'm sorry," she said. "I'm sorry," she said.
Miss Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann
Would you like to repeat my words? She was not surprised. I really didn't take away the so-called elders of your East Palace.
But they didn't believe what she said, and they knew she didn't confess.
A few people didn't know what to do next.
Of course they didn't know that's what they were going to do, because she couldn't have let Wu Hai Hong live any longer.
Miss Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann
Wu Lin stopped the whole people stuck.
"Why did your father...
"She didn't finish," she said.
"Our eastern house has lost its witchcraft, and the old man is the only one who knows, and if he is not there is no hope of reviving.
"Rejuvenation" said An, laughing, "Are you going to spread the great witch, so as to continue to harm people?"
"I don't mean that.
"I'm really sorry I didn't take your elder and I don't know who he is. I'm sorry, but if there's nothing else, please come back.
He's sent orders.
The family had no way at once, even the last of the killers, when they saw that she was still not doing anything, they really had no way.
That's it.
Emperor of the East fell down.
"What are you doing? I have never seen the elders of your family.
Finally they left.
There's no way.
There was silence in the room, and Xiao Li looked at Wu Liang, and asked, "Do you think I am also uncompassionate?
"No," Wu said, "I understand what you are thinking, and what you are doing in your position is right. I am now separated from the East Palace family, so it is a matter for other families, and I will not comment on it.
"When the curse is gone, even if the whole thing is gone, to tell the truth, when it is gone, it is you who I thank most. If you hadn't taken the initiative to contact me, I wouldn't have known the existence of this person, or to say, even if I knew the existence of you, it would have taken a long time, and if it wasn't you, I wouldn't have known these things in such a short time.
"I'm glad to be able to help you with this," he said. "It's really strange that fate has brought me together in this way."
Henry, when he came down from the stairs, had a moment to look at him and to laugh at him. He stood at the door of the stairs and cried without hesitation to him, "Come up, I'll tell you something.
"What is it?
"Come up," he said, turning himself up, "and little lemon really thought he had something to do, and after he went up, he knew he had nothing to do with it.
Didn't you say something?
"What's the matter?
Without saying anything, he glanced at him, "Well, you'll be fine, I'll go down."
Hold on.
What's the matter?
When did you let that guy go?
"Sit here for a while," said An, thinking of how to arrange for him after the curse has been lifted and after Wu's address has been approved.
Henry was unhappy.I think there are strangers at home that make me unhappy.
It wouldn't have been nice.
"And little lemon, this is my dish!"
So you admit you're lying? she said to him.
Who says we are? Isn't it?
That's right. She sat down by the bed, her hands slightly supported behind her, "I have a special need now, and I hope you can satisfy me.
Henry twitched, You come again.
"What's the name again? Isn't that normal?Henry, I think it's necessary for us to have a good physical exchange, and I hope you can feel my advice with your heart.
CHAPTER 13
"No need."
He turned straight out, and behind him came his cry, Where to go?
When you die.
When Ann Li came downstairs, Wu Lian had not come downstairs.
She sat on the couch, and switched on the TV, and was playing a archaeological documentary.
There was an interview with Wang, staring at the TV screen, and she was very relaxed, so looked a few minutes, and she made a phone call to Pan Zhonghui.
"It's me," he said.
"Oh, little lemon."
"Are the archaeologists now or are the kings now?"
"Yes, but I was going to contact you about him these two days, and since you last said anything about his connection to the theft, I've been spying on him, and now I've got the results.
It's a little bit of a surprise. "You're doing a pretty good job.
"Look at what you're saying, and what you've said I can't keep in mind," said Pan. "I don't know the three words either, little Lemon.
All right, I'll go now.
"Well," he said.
When she said that, she turned off the television.
Pan had a good look at the information, and when he came, he made tea, "Come, little lemon, I bought a new tea, taste, sit down, we'll talk slowly.
Ann, taking over, sat in front of him, What's the matter?
"According to the investigation, this captain, oh, it's disappointing, it's hard to see it in ordinary life, I don't know, it turns out that the captain hasn't been in contact with him for a long time, but he's been in contact with the sellers of national treasures, and we've found that he's sold himself things that should have been passed on to the nation, and he's been making a lot of money.
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
"Yes, of course."
Besides, this man is the old man who steals the tomb, and you, too, watch as a surveillance object, he is daring to continue to steal the tomb at home, you watch to do.
"Well, I know that."
An asked again, Has the special team not found the officer to replace Yuan?
When he said this,Pan couldn't help sighing,I wanted to find it early, I had told you, where is it so easy, always not to find it, it's not so easy, finding it a few days ago, or a gangster, really making yourself a fairy, little lemon, come back, even if it's just a chance to investigate a case, isn't it good?
There are some of the cases of twenty years ago that have not been broken, and there are no outsiders here, and I can only tell you, that there are some cases that if you don't have a hand, you'll never have a head, and no one can break them, and there's no sufficient evidence, that we are on a small scale, that we can's no hand.
What does that mean?
Don't you still don't understand? Pan put down his voice.
"I'm also the head of the special group, but I can't come to the office every day, because I have more personal things to do, and I can only do it, maybe for a few days a month, or maybe for a few days a month, and not necessarily.
When she agreed, Pan was about to jump, "All right, all right, even one month, one day, little lemon, our country needs a lot of people like you, and I'll just tell you something, I'll just tell you, and you'll see, the big hangovers, they haven't been broken in years, except with sufficient evidence, and more of them have been in the previous years, without monitoring, without fingerprints, so it's not as easy to break, as it is now, and, what you just told me, like the kind of evidence that doesn't make a case, in fact, I'm more angry than anyone.
"So, first, you will arrange for me the information and evidence of this famous case, and you will send it to the Special Team, and I will go there and see it.
"All right.
He put down his cup and went out of the office to the Special Unit. Quietly in the Special Unit, he pushed the door open and looked inside, and found that everyone was sitting there thinking and shut up.
Zhong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
"What are they doing?
She said as she came in. "It's not a big deal yet, but, little lemon, how come you're here?
"Well, I'll talk to the director, but there's a good thing I'll let you know.
She went to sit at the table, guess what?
Some men look at each other, okay?
What's good?
Gues.
"What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "
How do you think that's true? asked Ann. What do you eat every day, old horse?
"Eat anything."
"Yes, our old horses not only eat grass but also shit," said Gong.
"You're awful," cried the king. "Come to me," said the king.
Goo shook his eyes and said,The old horse is going to jump.
The originally quiet atmosphere washed up in a moment, after a moment of excitement, Ma Jiang asked uncertainly, "Commander, are you really coming back?
"What's good to cheat on you" "I just told the chief, but I can't come every day, maybe not for a month, but the chief says it's okay."
"Oh, don't you see? Don't you all see? I said something good is going to happen today, look, something good is going to happen!
When the case is over, let's start a new one, and I'll just say hello to you first, okay, don't bother your minds, go on, I'll go.
"The chair isn't hot yet.
Don't be afraid of disturbing you, work well, see you later.
She got up and walked.
On her way back, she stopped at the door of a supermarket because of thirst and got off to buy water.
But I didn't expect to meet the Stone River and...
Fi Fi Fi.
What she got was that Shimaogawa and the foot fibers had been separated.
Why is the world so strange?
"Oh, you're really good at it.
An took a bottle of mineral water and opened his mouth.
CHAPTER 13
What do you mean? He looked straight at her, What did I do?
"You two aren't divided. How can you be together again?
It's up to both of us, and it's not up to you.
Little Lemon shrugged, Oh, good luck.
When he saw her going away, he held her arm and said, Isn't she annoying?
Isn't she's been very annoyed?She's been very annoyed.She's been very annoyed.
"Well, it's almost."
Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go
"The Stone River."
Shimaogawa wasted his time on her.
"I want to give you a warning. "I don't know what you want to hear."
"Take off your set."
"That's what you said," said Anne, "I won't say that, but don't you feel very sick?"
She went around the car and said no more to pull the door to get into the car, but at this time Shimaogawa shouted at her, "Wait.
She opened the window.
Did you see what came?
One of the other's swiftly interrupted: "And little Lemon, don't behave like a god before us; we're not going to eat you."

Liang leaned lazy on the back of the chair, looking at the two outside the car, "But any woman, I will never have such a conscience to say these things to you, because you yourself are not a good thing, but at least you are the woman I hate most, oh, balancing again, I really don't want to see the woman live so independently, Ishimaogawa, you are back.
Who is behind?
She grinned at him,What do you say?I want to.
No more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shimaogawa stood there, then looked at the fiber, "Is she talking about the ghost you are doing?
"Maogawa, don't believe her ghosts. Of course it's not me.
"I've been with her, haven't you listened to her mouth say you don't want to see me live, this damned little lemon, she's just saying some kind of fairy tale, don't believe her, she's trying to make us both feel better.
Then why did she know I was sick?
"You're so bad you can't see unless you're blind."
Fi continued,Don't believe her.
Shimaogawa had a bit of pain in his head, not to say anything else, he went straight into the car, and he sat down as the assistant driver.
The car headed for the stone house.
On the way the two had nothing to talk about, Ishimaogawa pushed the car home, and when he got home, he fell asleep, sitting on the side of the bed a little bit.
But as soon as it occurred to him that he was a bad man, he would not have liked to beat her to death with a hammer.
However, there seems to be no doubt.
On this side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nevertheless, toddlers do their own business, and to serve badly is to be reversed.
Does she really know the rules?
A stupid woman.
It's like giving your life to the devil and getting the devil to do it for you.
Exchange.
I don't know what she wants to do.
Looks like she's trying to get her way out of the Stone River, but nothing else looks like it.
Anyway, I don't have anything to do with myself.
Everybody has a life.
In the afternoon, with a big stomach, came the moon.
When the pregnancy was near, she had arranged the nursery, but had not yet prepared the clothes for the child, and was going to let her accompany her to pick, just because she had nothing to do with it, she agreed.
Wu Lin also went with, he mostly drive, and bring things, originally wanted to call Henry, but An Xiao Li wanted to go, Henry certainly didn't want to be a person who brings things, he had the temper to see, but did not call him.
Strangely, because she did not cry, he stood alone at the window.
Chen's hair comb a little bit, then spread on both sides of the face, to keep the round face a lot, because of pregnancy, the face grows spots, plus the whole pregnancy for the baby, can not make-up make-up, no make-up, no makeup, no makeup, no makeup, no makeup, no makeup, no makeup, no makeup, no make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up,
Only the beautiful wind still can't stop.
She came down slowly, walking very carefully, lest she fall down, because now her stomach is up and she can't see the way under her feet, and little Lemon followed her, reminding her to be careful, lest any accident occur.
Wu Lin stopped driving,the two of them sitting together in the rear seat.
The car stopped safely in front of百货大 Xiamen.
This House is one of the industries named after the Jinji Group.
An Xiao and Jin-they both come a few times, and when they get off they wear hats and masks, after all, considering that Jin doesn't make-up, if it's taken by someone, and to make a moth in the press, and, Jin Jin to pick up things, is in the manner of paying, not wanting to rely on this is the industry of the Jin family directly on account, so simply pretend to be more time-saving.
Three people walked through the automatic door of the building, saw the sign, and entered the mother and child special cabinet.
Since Wu Lian did not wear a mask, the salesman looked at him a few times.
Bring us all the best boys' supplies and clothes here, and we'll see, he said.
The salesman wasted his eyes, Is it all?
All, and the best, let's choose.
The Salesman shouted at the manager, bringing together a lot of baby clothes and supplies.
"That's all it is," he said.
Let it go.
Wu stopped and turned to the two women around him and said, Choose.
Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm afraid we can't afford all this," he said. "We can't afford all this," he said.
Chen had to choose a few sets, smaller ones and medium ones, "Of course, the child grows fast, can't wear so much, it's enough, let's choose some first.
CHAPTER 13
After a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As soon as the manager heard, his smiling face suddenly cooled down, he hummed, "You people, who have no money to put on anything big, and who are so brave as to take out all of the most expensive, the result is not to buy half.
"A dozen small suits are enough to be replaced, not enough to be bought, so close, what is this, is there still a shortage of these things in market A," he explained.
The salesman, who was also a mother, was busy saying, Manager, the guests don't want to buy, nor can we force, these are indeed the same.
But her words not only didn't work, but even more irritated the manager, "Do I want you to teach me? Am I the manager or are you?
The salesman wasted, even shrinking, You are, of course you are.
"Look, this manager doesn't know much about salesmen, but you two should change jobs. Manager, you can go and be a salesman, or you can resign.
The Manager was more angry when he heard this, but anyway, it was also a guest, so he kept his temper on, "It's an internal matter, we can be managers, we can't be salesmen.
Zhang looked at the manager so loud, a little unhappy, "Well, these are not, in this is not only this special cabinet, sister, go, we go see another special cabinet.
Not one of them, but the manager was not happy, "You have to go, buy these and go.
Wu stopped and said,You're not buying selling?
"If you don't, who let you take so much of it, will you care to play with us?It's all in your bags."
That's what it means.
It's just that's what happened. She was going to take out her cell phone, but she didn't want to.
Just pay, and I'll let you go.
"Who gave you the courage to dece a guest? Put it in a bag and put it out, and bring the phone.
At this time, she still thought about it, after all, is the selling place, stirring something quiet, not good.
But the manager didn't see her intention to not give the phone.
Little Lemon couldn't do it, she had to take off the hat and the mask, to see her target manager and salesman Zi.
She came to the manager, took the phone, and attached a word to him, "You are really brave.
The manager's face was white, completely missing the face and speech, at this moment he feels like a soft egg, three sticks can't kick a shit.
"And...
Miss Ann,I'm sorry,I don't know Taishan,I'm sorry,I apologize to you.
"You don't have to apologize. After all, your apology is not sincere. It's no different than yours.
The manager wasted no time standing there.
"You go," cried the salesman. "Come and call me the head of your company."
"Yes."
A few minutes later, the head of the company was running down the road, followed by several people, including the salesman who was breathing.
Grandma, it's really a rat that broke a pot of porridge, the staff we sell on weekdays are not afraid of the guests, I'm not good at managing, Grandma, rest assured, I'll take care of this in the future, the manager I'll get rid of him.
All right, I don't want to see anything like this happen again, okay?
"Yes," said Granny, "there is no second."
When the chief said this, he hurriedly ordered the salesman, "Come and get the things that grandma saw.
The moon moon moon moon moon moon
"I'm sorry," said the head of the company. "I'm sorry," said the head of the company.
"Well," I said, "it's all right. I'll go and look for something else.
On her way, she had made it clear that she did not need to give her white, nor did she need to pay for her, so she did not stop her from paying.
On the way back, as the car was about to turn to go down the road, a powerful car was racing backwards at speed, and the man in the black ink was going up.
The three stared at the car, and most importantly, the car was very similar to the car that Wen had been talking about, because it was running too fast, and An Xiao Zi didn't see too well.
Wu stopped to see a passing car, shocked, almost shaking hands with the steering wheel, "This man who drives is really crazy, drives so fast, really does not want to die.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And little Li looked forward, to see the number of the car at the end, she said, in truth, without a word, to the one on the side, "It's your brother's race car.
"Oh," said Kim, "why did I go so fast?"
Who knows?
When the car was about to overtake the Mercedes suddenly took off again.
Let's go with him.
"Yes," he said.
Wu's eyes closed, his eyes fixed on the fast car that ran ahead, the oil door under his feet stepped steadily, fast and steady.
So I followed the car to the door of a restaurant.
Looking at Henry and Xiao White from the front of the car, he suddenly realized that he was being followed.
She got out of the car and let Wu Lin stop and take her back to the moon, after all she is pregnant.
He walked toward the restaurant door.
Henry sat at the table by the window, and the two who followed him sat not together, but at the other table.
"What are you doing just now? "And little lemon sits opposite Henry. "What are you doing so fast?
"Why didn't you come with me?"
They're back.
He saw this, of course, and asked her deliberately.
CHAPTER 13
Then why didn't you go back together?
Didn't I see you came in? said Anne directly, Didn't you come to the restaurant to eat the food at home?
"Can't we just go out and eat?"
Of course.but it's only ten and you're hungry?
"Are you hungry?"
Feeling like he wasting on her, said An, what do you want?
"The man I've been with hasn't come yet," he said.
"You have a date?" asked Anne. "Who?"
Does it have to do with you
And little lemon felt deeply his intense flavour of fire, how did she attract him?
Neuropathy.
However, silenced.
Ann's hands crossed against her chin, stared at him.
He wasted by her, turning his eyes out of the window.
About ten minutes later, Li, Jean, came over.
Miss Li came, please sit.
"Thank you," she said with a smile, "It's really a surprise that I've been on holiday today," she said.
That's what happened when you told your brother that he hadn't seen you in a long time, and he thought about getting out to dinner with you, and asking what happened to you, because you're his kindness, and he's always remembering it.
"I'm fine," said Li. "I'm fine," said Li. "I'm fine," said Li Li. "I'm fine," said Li Li. "I'm fine," said Li Li Li. "I'm fine," said Li Li Li.. "I'm fine," said Li Li.. "I'm fine," said Li Li Li.. "I'm fine," said Li Li Li.. "I'm fine," said Li Li Li.. "I'm fine," said Li Li Li.. "I'm fine," said Li Li Li... "I'm fine," said Li Li Li... "I'm fine," said Li Li Li... "I'm fine," said Li Li Li Li... "I'm fine," said Li Li Li
Henry handed her the menu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes," he said.
Le Beau Jean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The atmosphere was a bit awkward, and I couldn't find anything in common.
When he was so stuck, he suddenly said to Henry, "I want to be with you.
The four who heard it fell on her face.
Little White and Xiao Huang laughed, and Li was even more embarrassed.
Henry just doesn't know how to talk.
If there was only one, he would have said to her directly, Born from a child.
But now there are around.
I've got an idea to get this thing back and we're going to have a good discussion.
Inadvertently, three solitary dogs around were forced to feed dogs.
An understands that he doesn't know anything about his past, because he doesn't have any memories of her past, nor of her past, nor of her pregnancy.
Under the table, she gently stretched out her feet, then unintentionally caught his feet.
Henry's eyes were fixed on her, and he didn't even know she was at the bottom of the table, for Lepage was sitting next to him.
When the meal came up, An Xiao Li just a few, did not eat.
When she wiped her mouth with her paper towels fell off the ground, then she bent to pick them up, stretched out her hand and touched Henry's leg.
Henry was in a hurry.
She's sneaking at herself in such a large audience.
And when she picked up the paper towels without any wave of her face, she whispered to him very quickly.
And I sit on the right end, as if nothing is affected.
Don't eat this meal at least don't feel like.
As soon as he had finished, he said to her, "You and little Huang Xiaoping are going to the car, too, and I have something to say to Bao-jean alone.
An is very refreshing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three people went out soon.
He looked at the three getting into the car, then turned his head and said to the one on the side, Good to work at the company, have enough time to go home and see your parents, and when the company meets anything needing help, look for the little lemon or the van captain, you know
Tell me brother, you told me when I went to the company, now you told me again, are you going to go on business again?
"Yes," Henry told him, "I go on business often, not often, in city A."
"Tell me, brother," Li looked at him, "How do I feel like you're not coming back to a place far away?"
"Let's go," he said no more. "They're waiting. I'll send you back to the company."
"All right.
To return to the car again to Vine, however...
To the garage, still quiet in the car.
Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai, they both followed.
The two had to go back to the second floor.
It was Ann who began by saying,Let's go back to the car.What did you say to her?
He said some unspeakable things.
An Xiao Li feels like he's kind, "What's the matter?
"It's okay," he said, "It's okay." He pulled off the blanket, and closed his eyes, as if he didn't want to deal with her.
Come over, throw the shoes, half knee on the bed look at him, "Henry, you are on the table but promise to give me a baby.
Doesn't it look like I don't want you to lose face?
You've changed.
And little Lemon looked at him,You're not the one who hates my Henry,And if you were like before, would you care if I was ashamed?
He squinted at her.I want you to promise me one thing.
Did I promise, and you want to live with me?
Well, what do you say first?
Later, when I wasn't there, he met Joan and hoped to say goodbye to her, and occasionally to see her parents, even once a year.
"What if he doesn't?
"No, he will. He will listen to you."
Ann is going crazy, looking at his fascinating eyes, really want to swallow him.
"I know you don't want to touch me, but I'm curious, and at this time I can want to touch you, and I promise you to kiss me.
"No," he said.
Don't count.
She was about to cross over from him into the bed, but she did not realize that he had said, "Take a kiss.
Then she rode on him, and kissed him with her lower head, and Henry had not yet come to repent, for where was she?
She had a physical reaction to kiss him.
When he finally let go, Henry looked at her as if she could not move anymore.
CHAPTER 13
And little lemon looked at him with satisfaction and said sweetly, "Oba, Sara, hey.
Henry's heart beat without any sign, and he couldn't speak.
An Xiao Li lying next to him, hug his neck, "Today I went with Lu to buy baby goods, and I saw that baby goods especially want to reproduce a child, so there are three children in the house, how good.
His lips were moving, and he wanted to say something, but he didn't.
She didn't hear his voice for half an hour, thinking he was asleep, looked up, and found him open eyes, and didn't know what to think.
How do I feel about you?
"No."
Henry, let's go to sleep.
Okay, go to sleep.
She repeatedly bit the two words,,,,,,,,OK
"OK.
She sat down and looked at him carefully,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm Henry"
"What's the matter," he said, "and if there's anything you're not happy about, just tell me.
"And little lemon."
"Well?
Would you hate me if I never disappeared?
"The question... "I don't want to answer.
He nodded, and seemed to have understood.
What are you doing?
"Henry, are you crazy?
Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand
The sound of the room is so good that all the quiet of the room is not heard outside.
It's noon.
Aunt Chen knocked again, Grandma, Grandpa, get up and eat, it's three.
There was a soft Microsoft, "You know, Aunt Chen, it's going down."
As she said, Aunt Chen went downstairs to prepare.
An little lemon opened his eyes a little and then turned to the man next to him.
She never thought, really never thought he would be so active, and it was a scene of his madness.
Normally he didn't want her to touch a finger, really deserved such an old saying, the more unthinkable, the more unexpected.
And little Lemon pulled up and found a piece of paper lying on the counter.
There was also a pen next to the paper.
When she saw the word, she took it with her hand.
There are a few words above.
Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet
- - -
When he saw these, he shook his hand slightly.
To her, today, he made her feel so surprised.
She doesn't even know when she'll make him love her.
It would have been better if he had disappeared.
But anyway. This silent farewell.. makes her feel a little sad.
Sitting there she paused for a long time before putting her body back there, holding the man beside her.
The man who was embraced her unconsciously, and shouted, Little Lemon.
"Well.
He opened his eyes and looked at her closest, and then at himself.
Soon he reacted.
They are honest.
Chen thought of a scene of cloud over rain.
Immediately, more and more memories gradually made him sit freely.
"Tell me, what is it?"
Chen said, holding her, little lemon.
"Well, what's going on?
How did I suddenly remember Henry?
You know what's happening.
If the original two memories were separated, blocked, now just connected, the price is Henry really disappeared.
"He's adhered to my terms, and he's gone," he said. "In fact, it's just those unhappy, negative things you've got to see," he said. "You're either yourself, or Henry, or Ken, and you're just yourself. You're a man. But, you're also a precursor," he said. "Double personalities are now diagnosed as incurable in medicine.
He Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love
"I also felt suddenly," I thought, "he must have found out today that he wasn't averse to me, but moved," "he's not in the right state today, and he's suddenly depressed and pressed me on the bed, huh?"
Zhang said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No, I'm going to get up, it's three in the afternoon, I'm going to eat, and since all his memories are with you, I'm not going to say anything to you alone, especially about Lepage," Henry said, "I'm going to see her parents at least once a year, and she'll be better, and I'm going to support, after all, the one who saved you, and we'll be better off," he said.
"It must," he said, "but I'll say it again."
What do you say again?
Say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Little Lemon followed him and shouted, "Oba, Sara Hey, brother, I love you.
He couldn't be more cheerful, and hugged her.
October 16 is the birthday of Jin.
For him, the best birthday gift, is the removal of the curse.
They weren't worried that Wu would deceive them, after all he knew that he would die in their hands, and that his descendants would still be alive.
At this time, he had no time to do anything else.
He lifted up their curse on the sixteenth day, but as the curse was lifted up, he was also to die.
Wu's witchcraft was completely discontinued.
For the East Palace family, An thought, they want to kill themselves, to let Wu Hai Port die in their own hands.
Nothing else matters anymore.
After the curse was lifted, Wuhai Port was also secretly executed.
At last, the burden of her mind was lifted, and this was the most relaxing phase of her nervous days.
Wu's application has been approved.
Since you have permanent residence here, then, I have arranged for you a job, a tutor in the university, although the school is forbidden to students love, but I think this is the most place for girls, and if there are two lovers, you can do another job, or you can hide and hide.
CHAPTER 13 If You
It's nice to me, but I'm a little worried.
"What?"
"The East Palace family will continue to seek my revenge. "
Do you think they are still going to do this?And then I'll make another statement to them and tell them that you are my good friend and that if they are going to trouble you again, I'll be in charge of them, okay?
"Little Lemon."
"It's not the right thing to do," laughed Anne. "For your good, the curse is settled, and I'll take care of you myself, so go for the safe life you want, and look for the girl you like."
Well, I'll try.
All day long, the servants of the estate are preparing a birthday party.
Although he has the best birthday gift, it does not mean to celebrate no more.
We'll invite our closest friends to a small party. to celebrate for him.
Just after five o'clock in the afternoon, after he had taken out his bath, he was caught and taken to the bed, and he said, "You have to sing me a birthday song first.
"When the banquet begins, I'll give you a good song.
"I want to hear you sing.
"You're three years old. Well, today's your birthday, you're the oldest, isn't it, I'm starting to sing a song for our oboe.
He shook his hands and looked at An Xiao Li just laughed.
Happy Birthdaytoyou.
It's good.
Just after the whole was put under his, he turned, kissed her and scratched her itch, the two on the bed rolling, at this moment, little lemon laughed not to stop.
She would have laughed for three more minutes if the door had not been knocked.
It's van Schein who's sent the equipment for the birthday party tonight.
Made for her clothes and shoes.
After looking open, she especially liked this dress, white little evening dress, with diamond high heels, these high heels are specially made for An Xiao Zi who doesn't like to wear high heels, high heels are very high, but walk up especially steady, foot style also presents very beautiful.
After they had a good look at each other, when they came downstairs, a wave of people had come.
Liangshan night and Jin lying on the sofa, Long Tian Ze originally sat on the other side of Liangshanshan night, however, he felt uncomfortable sitting, directly lying on Liangshanshan night's legs.
Unless he's a friend, he's been taken to the state of Java by a shoe bottom early in the night.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
"Yes, my sister, you look really good."
Chen also praised, " beautiful. "
"The money is there."
Yan laughed, "Why haven't you come yet?
"Go get the kids, how can the kids not participate in this celebration.
As long as the children come, the people who come are basically all together.
There's nobody here. And it's small.
So it was more than six that the birthday party started.
After the opening speech, Fan was in charge of arranging, and after the opening speech, it was to let Yang say the wish to cut the cake.
Going to the cake, the birthday song, holding his hand and closing his eyes, soon, he gently blow the candle on the cake.
There's a ringing below.
Chen said, "I have just made a wish. Do you want to know what it is?"
She stared at him, looking at him, wondering what his wish was.
My wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish
"Well," said the dragon with his head, and with his excited clapping.
Others cried out.
Only Sion stood there quietly watching Yang speak, face smiling.
When he cut the cake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even more so were some of the children who sneaked together into a room and took a drink.
As a result,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
She still saw him. She didn't want to see him at all.
"Miss Ann..."
"If you're here to let me speak for you, it's not worth saying, it's not worth saying.
Wang didn't think she'd known, Miss Ann, when did you...
Did You Know The Early News Even though it has been reported, it has been known before.
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
And...you've done all these illegal things, and you can say you're still here, and the policemen must have arrested you on the way?
When Wang listened to her speech, a sweat had come out, Miss Ann, please help me one time, I promise never again to commit.
Captain, don't you hear me?And little Lemon stood up and took the consequences of what he had done.
"Grandma," said the captain.
Well, isn't he here?
Van Schein made a request to the guard outside the door.
Several officers entered and brought out the king, and little Lemon breathed and asked, Seong, I really don't know what the king captain thinks.
"I don't know what he's thinking. I guess he doesn't know that's why you're going to want to get lucky.
"It's possible tos a stone on your head, who has a way."
After lunch, An Xiao Zi received a phone call from Pan Zhenghui, who asked her to go to the office.
Anne went, and Pan Zhonghui called her to talk mainly about two things: the first is about the king's present life and the second is about giving her the case.
First of all, speaking of Wang's present life, Pan Zhenghui shook his head, "He's really a pity, you say so many years in the archaeological team, and he's a captain, how can he make such a mistake, this captain, if he's not, if he's lost his job, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison.
CHAPTER 13 21
An asked,Have you got it?
"Can't you catch him? "You've already ordered me to look at him, and I've sent people to look at him, and he's been taken by the overseas police, and he's bigger than the king.
How many years do you expect to be sentenced?
The Conservative estimates that has been for more than a decade.
After all, everyone has a life, and everyone should be responsible for himself.
Tell me about the case.
"Well," said Pan, "there are two famous pending cases, which you will have to investigate first, and which have not been solved for many years, but one of which, although there is ample evidence, I feel is still very difficult, and you will have to go back and study it with some of the members of the special team.
"Well," said Ann, "I know."
When she went out of her office she opened her file.
All the papers are yellow and look like they've been there for a couple of years.
Kicking open the door to the office, Anne went in, and a few people looked at her off the door, and the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door open the door, Anne went on the door open the door open the door, Anne went on the door open the door, Anne, you are here, you, you are here, you are waiting for you, the case is
An Xiao Li sat down and said to them, "I have in my hand two famous hangings, I have taken a rough look, one is twenty-two years ago, one is fourteen years ago, are all famous hangings, all the cases, the people who are doing the cases must not be the people who have thought hard and have a strong anti-detection capability, ten years ago and even twenty years ago, you can think, there was no supervision, there were no fingerprints, it is really not easy to break the cases, these two cases you look roughly first, finish, I'll look again.
She handed her file to each of them to read, and after ten minutes, all looked at the emphasis, and handed the case back to her.
After all, do you think it would be better if we started with one?
"I suggest that we start with the case of the widow's village, which is the longest, and although it is controversial on the Internet, it is far less than the other case in which there is clear evidence, and I think that the case in which there is no evidence is very difficult, so we have to start with the difficult one.
"I also agree with the old horse," said the chief, "I've been looking at the case on the Internet," he said, "but I think it's a good thing that the perpetrator is still alive," he said, "and that's the place where the dead are most unable to meditate," he said, "and that's the place where it's most difficult to investigate," he said, "and I agree to do it first."
"Well, let's do it first," he nodded, "but do you think it's easy to deal with a second case of proven evidence?If it's so easy to deal with, why is there evidence that has been stopped from being investigated and hasn't been closed?"
"It's not the perpetrator's family background," said Ma. "It's not the perpetrator's family background," said Ma. "It's the perpetrator's family background," said Ma. "It's the perpetrator's family background," said Ma. "It's the perpetrator's family background," said Ma. "It's the perpetrator's family background," said Ma. "It's the perpetrator's family background," said Ma. "It's the perpetrator's family background.
"Be honest with your mouths," "We haven't started the second case," "be honest with your mouths," "or the consequences will be self-inflicted."
Oh, little lemon, you put your heart in your belly a hundred times, what are we doing, we're a policeman, okay?
"I'll take the second case back home and discuss it with you as soon as it starts. Now, all my attention is focused on the first case, and I want to use a non-verbal investigative method, to investigate slowly, and this case is estimated to have become a bargain in the village, and I want to make it clear that before this case happens, the proportion of men and women in the village is normal, right?
"Yes, after this incident, the men of the village died two to three, and there were many men who did not dare to stay at home, and there were many who moved, and who now lived in the village, and were old men and middle-aged widows and children, and most of the old men were widows.
"Twenty years ago, it was widely said that we were going to execute the dead to repay the village, so now we are basically linking the dead of the victims to this.
"It seems to me that is what I would have done if I wanted to know about the widow's village.
"Are we going with you have any other plans?"
"It's sure that's why so many people come together and give you assignments.
She said inconsistently, "Jodong, Gong-le and Ding-le, you two young men, go to the villages around the widows, and do not cast any doubt on the villagers around them.
Little Lemon, you are discriminating against me at my age.
"I don't want to stay in the office, I'm with them, I'm an experienced old cop, and I know more than they do.
"Well, that's it. I'll take the case back and look at it carefully. You three will go for an inspection, and Zu Dong will come back with me to the Viney area."
"Go."
An Xiao Li drives back to Zhong, finds Jin is still at home, not going to the company.
Why don't you go to the company
"Wait a minute.
Chen, when he saw Zong come with him, asked, "Do you really take the case?
"Well," I answered, "I'll go to the widow's village this afternoon, and I won't come back for a while."
Shen said she did not like to hear such a thing, and she said that he would sleep alone in the evening, and that he would not see her in a short time.
Then are you going to live there?
"Well, of course."
"I used to pretend to be a couple's house," said An, thinking and adding.
It's better to tell him soon enough so that he doesn't have to eat vinegar any more.
Chen did not agree, "Let the world go with you. "
CHAPTER 13
"Why? Shen is your help. I'm going to break the case, and I'm going to be with the cops in our group. "And what's he seeing? "I've never been to V before.
"I'm not angry, am I angry, mainly you go I'm not angry, so I'm more angry with you.
When I saw his strong words, it was obvious that he did not want others to pretend to be a couple with her.
Did you think of his girlfriend's feelings?And little lemon put his hand out to the grandfather's outside waiting, and grandfather was a little embarrassed, and went out immediately.
Either you don't, or you take him, you choose.
"He's talking."
"I didn't hear.
"Brother."
It's not enough to call grandpa.
Come near him and sit beside him.What kind of man are you? Thirty-four years old, not three or four years old.
"I want my people to be with you, if I can be with you I will be alone, but the company I have to deal with, let Xiang go with you, he pretends to be a couple I'm sure, you pretend, and have experience.
Do you hear me?
All right, let the world be, and I see that you'll be safe with your people.
And little lemon stare at him, Are you satisfied?
Well, I'm satisfied.
He pressed Fan's number again and gave it a quick cut, and within a short time Fan's came.
"Mr.
Go on a country trip with your grandmother.
Fan is not supposed to travel with himself? How turn to himself?
"Sir, go to the countryside?"
"Well, it's been a lot of work for you lately," he said.
"No matter what you say, I always feel like a fraud.
"Don't listen to me," he said. "Where are you going?" "No," he said. "I'm going to the country to investigate a case.
Before he finished, his mouth was covered with force.
Fan, having heard what might have been said, added to what had not been said,That policeman at the gate, my lord doesn't want you to pretend to be couples, he sends me, to be precise, my lord doesn't like the people you don't trust pretending to be couples, even if he knows it's fake, even if he knows nothing's going to happen, but he's watchful, he's not.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
"If you don't get it's hard to buy me. "I'd like to do that. "You're not going.
That's enough, said An, stretching out his forefinger, and pinching directly on his head,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The car left the city at one and a half, until five and a half in the afternoon, a full four hours.
When we came to the village, the day was very dark, and it was going to rain.
Anne left Van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van
It was astonishment to hear that two of them were going there.
"Are you two going back to see your parents?" he asked.
"No, we're looking for relatives."
"But don't stay there" "Oh, this is a very evil village, a village where the rest are women, and it's hard to see the men, so there are usually no men there," "You and your men don't stay there any longer, go back, look, it's going to be dark."
"Brother, is there really such an evil gate? "I'm a little scared to say.
It's true that's what the men in the village used to do in a short period of time, almost to die, and that's what the big guys here know, don't they?
"Well, it's the first time," said Anne.
It's no wonder, listen to me.
"Well, thank you, brother."
After seven and eight minutes the three-car stopped in front of the widow's village. The brother who drove the three-car did not like it, and did not go forward.
Xiao Li paid for the car, and Van Xiang walked past.
"Seong, remember when the three of us went to the country of V with Xiao Bai, and when we pretended to be couples, now it's still like that, and I call it Kim.
"Well, I know," he said, "and my acting is a bar.
"Yes, I agree with your acting. You are sometimes blindly worried.
It's because you care so much.
"There is someone in front of the village, go up and ask.
Their two steps up, And little Lemon smiled and greeted, "Good, sir, is there a house to rent in the village? We are both doing a little business in the town, but the house in the town is too expensive, and it is very close to the town, so we want to rent a house in the nearby town, and the other villages asked, and there is nothing.
A middle-aged woman stood up enthusiastically, "My two lower rooms are empty, only..."
Her voice wasted,Your husband and wife, if they would not forsake the bad reputation of our village, they could rent it to you.
It doesn't matter, my husband is going to sleep in the store, not how to live here, mainly to cook here, I live here.
The middle-aged woman, as soon as she heard her words, said, That's very good, let it be to you.
Come on, Sister, take us to see the house, and if there's no problem, I'll stay.
All right, little sister, come with me.
The two followed the middle-aged woman into the village, stood in front of an iron door, took out the key and opened the big door, "My name is Wang, the children go to school, my husband works outside, hasn't come back for many years, I'm the only one at home, I haven't spoken at home, the lower room was where my daughter lived, it's pretty clean, but one year only come back summer vacation, empty and empty.
Sister Wang, how many people are in the village?
