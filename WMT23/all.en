The Beginning
The clouds over the sky, the dark ground all around is a wolf.
Their stairs, Their bloody corpses, their armor, their weapons, all were so confused, desolate, with the smell of death and danger.
Rod breathed, but he could not feel the cold and blood in the air, it was after all a game.
Thinking of this, Rod shook his head with a bitter laugh, then he turned and looked down at the warriors who were sitting on the ground not far from him, who were now quietly resting, restoring their strength, repairing their weapons.
On the surface looks nothing different from the week, but Rod is clear, this war, not as easy as before.
How many people are left?
He asked in silence.
When they heard the question, they looked at each other, and then a thin witch stood up.
Ninety- six, Commander, The Phantom is more dangerous than we imagined,and many of our brothers have been trapped in the past,but fortunately, our careers are in order now.
It'll be fine.
Hearing this,Rod nodded, and said nothing more, while the others remained silent.
I'm afraid they've lost the courage to start the mess, at last they're going to face, the most powerful, the most terrible, never conquered by anybody, the fictional dragon, the final wave of the third chapter of the online game Dragon Quest,
It's also the most frightening existence to date.
Faced with such battles, ordinary councils had to organize at least ten groups to dare to challenge, and now, Rod's men had only 96, so that a whole group could not fit together, but even so, in the eyes of these men, there was no panic or confusion at all, some only calmness, confidence and trust.
And those whom they trusted were standing in front of them on the steps not far from them, looking up at the sky, firm as a stone on their faces, and a cold scar from their foreheads, giving them a sense of deterrence.
The glittering helmet covered that mighty body, as if a wall never fell.
Of course, they are not because of the appearance of the serious and trustworthy man in front of them, no matter how strong, it is after all just the character of the game, the scar on the eyebrows is nothing to speak of the miserable past memories, just the accessories of the game set the face appearance.
Really deterrent is the countless rings and achievements behind the man.
The first to the top professional players.
The first to use the most difficult professional summon swordsman to the peak of the player.
Since the beginning of the first chapter "The Fall of Darkness", the Council, relying on its own abilities, and on the fear of familiarity with the whole profession, has swept through three entire information quarters, taking away all the bosses who killed the bosses.
Each copy of the video will be reproduced by countless players, dedicated to the teaching of the sacred existence of the first player of the mainland of the Dragons, the president of the board - - Rod.
He washed away the "dark coming", opened the "uncertainties", again conquered the "uncertainties", and came to the "uncertainties".
Now, he will once again use his hands to end this "empty trial", but, the new age, is no longer opened by himself.
It's been a few years?
Rod looked back from afar into the clouds of the dragon, and asked himself.
It's been seven years since his sister died, and in those seven years, in order to force himself to forget the painful past, he set himself almost unreachable goals once, and once again, and only the great excitement and glory of that time, can lighten the wounds left in his heart.
But it can only get there.
A month ago, Rod's parents were traveling abroad and were killed by a hurricane that caused the plane to crash. Rod had no idea how he felt when he first received the call, but now he had made a decision. to leave the game and return to real life, not just for his parents,
Rod was well aware that was the time to make a change.
"The meeting," said the president.
A timid voice broke Rod's memory, and he looked up, only to see a shy witch in the crowd, raising her hand, and staring at herself with shining eyes.
Are you really going to leave?
"Yes."
Rod nodded, then gathered his complex emotions, and he shook his head, and looked again at the companions who followed him, the friends of his seven years of recollection and of his seven years of struggle together.
But now he will leave them, though in the game, even with a single gesture, can be familiar to the extent of what the other wants to do.
But I'm afraid when I take off my game helmet and come back to reality, I can't recognize the other person anymore.
"My resume was sent yesterday and I hope to find a company that will accept me.
"If I get your resume, I will arrange for you to be the department manager.
A knight waved his large sword. His words also caused a somewhat dull atmosphere, and all laughed.
"Thank you for your kindness," I said, "but I didn't write it in my resume, because we had many enemies, and if they were received by the other members, my days would have been bad."
Rod laughed and answered, then he coughed and became more serious.
"I think everyone knows how we've come through these years.
Hearing this, all who had just laughed shut their mouths and began to listen quietly to his speech.
"We also know that on the forums, on the web, there are many people who are accusing us of breaking the balance of the game, of monopolising all the boss kills, and of making competition meaningful.
Frankly, I don't think that's wrong, but...
Saying this,Rod held his fist and waved.
"But what does it matter to us!We are the strongest council, we are the strongest team!We have this strength!So we have to do it, we have to take it!The other councils are not strong enough, to lose is their own problem, if they are strong enough, they will be able to break our monopoly, our monopoly on the bosses is not based on rules, it's not based on status, it's not based on the praise of the gaming company, it's based on our own strength!We've never given up, we've never conceded losses, we've never given up, so we've got what we've got now and everything, that's what we've got, that's how easy it is.
Rod stopped and went on.
"I love this meeting and I miss the seven years that we have spent together, but there are no endless feasts in the world, and I should be looking for my own life.
But I'll never forget all of you, and I'll never forget the meeting, where I carry my most painful memories, and also my most joyful memories, and I'll always remember it here.
said Rod, pointing at his head.
"Many people say I'm not going to play, and I think there are a lot of clubs now that know about this, and they think they're going to wait for me to go, and they're going to wipe out the club and break our record, but that's too small for us.
Dragons is not a game for me alone, I have no way to set up a community, I have no way to organize a team, nor is it possible to get the boss killed.
So I hope after I'm gone, you'll be able to take a good look at the guys who have the ghost idea, why this club is so strong, why our starlight is able to occupy the first real power of the Dragon Soul Continental club!
"Yes!"
"No problem, President!"
Give it to us, and then we will give the fools a perfect answer!
"It's good.
Hearing the answer, Rod nodded, then turned to the right of the crowd.
"Old Liu."
Hearing Rod's invitation, the tall witch went out of the crowd, came to his side, Rod looked at the witch in sight, paused, then reached out to take the badge from his chest, and placed it in his hand.
"The next generation is your generation."
Rod released his hand, and his voice was very calm, without any change.
"So, this battle is for you to command."
All right, Rod.
The Master nodded, but soon, he said again.
"Well, as the president, as the leader, I order you to lead the team."
"Old Liu?"
Hearing the answer, Rod frowned in surprise.
At this moment, in front of his thin physicist, but quietly smiled, then clapped Rod's shoulder.
"This is the time when you open up," "good starts good ends," "Rod," "that's the way of life."
..
When Rod heard this, he paused, and lifted his head, and looked at his companions, who were now ready, waiting for their orders as they had done before.
Rod, holding his sword, turned, and looked toward the high place, which was not far from his sight, where the thunder was raging, and there was a bright glow; and then Rod took up his long sword, and pointed forward, and he had had an ordinary beginning, and there was an ordinary end.
"It's crazy!"
The Dragon is indeed very strong.Rod had to deal with almost all of the top waves of the Dragon on the mainland, to the extent that there were other Dragons in the set, but there was not one more sophisticated than the present The The Dragon Dragon, its attack patterns were more complicated, almost irregular,
Its damage is several times higher than the normal wave, not to mention its speed, response, and even its defense.
This is indeed a difficult opponent.
Rod's hands with his long sword, his teeth clenched with his eyes fixed on the huge thing before him, the battle had reached its final end, and he was the only survivor, but even so, Rod's blood had been left without him, and the piercing red indicated to him that his own power had reached its limit.
What's wrong with the empty dragon?
Looking at the other's red, angry eyes, Rod had a strange feeling, as if he could feel the spirit of the empty dragon-as the most powerful, never conquered wave in the game, now falling into such a sudden downfall, it must be uncomfortable.
Then let me go with you.
Thinking about this,Rod raised his left hand.
Along with a loud cry, Rod's sword suddenly emitted a path of burning flame, they revolved in the form of a flying firebird, lifted up to the sky, thrust into the sight of the void dragon, and in the face of the coming attack, the void dragon also emitted a roar, and then raised his fore claws high, and fell violently.
Rhode felt his body shake, and a strong force washed over him, and the flaming bird washed away immediately after a cry, but before it disappeared, the strong explosion also made the empty dragon's claws, which had been waved, not work, but were shaken by the hard-being.
For a time, the open door.
Rod, biting his jaw, the brighter red of his eyes, suggesting that which he had suffered had reached a critical point, but now it was not within his scope of consideration,
This is the last chance either to succeed or to perish.
He took up his sword and struck it straight forward, but the empty dragon had now slowed down, and he roared, and then again cast out his claws, and at the same time Rod threw out his sword.
Lightning,start.
The Sword washed out the giant's chest, and Rod stared intently at it, looking at the glow of thunder from the gap between the giant's claws and then lightly tearing apart the giant's scales.
There was a deafening roar, and then a huge dragon claw was pressed against Rod's body.
The bright red almost covered the whole world, and Rod was no longer able to see the sight, but the system that emerged from the corners was still as clear as ever.
It's all over.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
Just then, a bright pillar came down from the sky, and enveloped the high place.
The pure white lighted the dark sky at that moment, and dissipated the clouds that had not gone.
Just as they were recovering from the grave, the others who were running to the high rise were suddenly stopped, and the world channel, which had been raging for the first time because of Starlight's record of killing, was suddenly quiet.
Once there was only one message left, which was a system announcement.
A legend that ruled the entire three game eras, thus ended.
Chapter 1 The New Journey
The wind blows through the valley and raises waves on the grass.
The cattle, which were bowing and eating the leaves of the green grass, lifted their heads and looked at the sky.
There was a wooden merchant vessel, several hundred feet long, floating in the air.
"Whatever you look at, the tide is so spectacular.
A middle-aged man, standing by the deck, looked down at this imposing grass and beauty.
It's a difficult business for us businessmen.
Standing beside the middle-aged man was a slightly fat merchant, with a strange curly hair, wearing the merchant's robe, with two small eyes squinting as if looking at the scenery before him,
Looking at him, it was as if even the sight in front of him could be taken to sell.
"I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to get the goods to the central area so quickly without it. "
"To tell you the truth, when I was planning to expand the market, I had some objections, but now it looks like my choice is really right.
"But, forgive me, you have not chosen a large route, but have gone from here, which may save you time, but which may increase the risk."
Besides, I think you've heard the captain warn, there seems to have been a snake out there recently, in case..."
The man's face wasted, and he turned his head, and turned his eyes to the near mountains.
The high clouds stopped him from seeing what was behind.
But rarely can be seen that far sky is not pure blue, but with a shade of darkness.
That's not the world they should be in.
"Don't worry," he said, "I've been hiring you for so long, because there's so much of it," he said.
There are only a few snakes, aren't there?
The merchant extended his hand and clapped the man's shoulder.
"Yes, but what about the young man who we rescued?"
Don't be dead yet.
"I've got a wound on him, and now he's asleep, and there should be no danger of his life."
It'll be fine.
Hearing the man's answer, the merchant nodded satisfactorily, but soon afterwards he frowned.
But what wound did the young man have, and from the wound it looked like a great lizard-but is there any strange thing in the north of Pafield?
"I don't know, sir, but it's supposed to be a very fierce beast, and I hope we don't meet it."
said the man, unconsciously sweeping the entrance of the cabin, then he turned again, looking forward.
Rod opened his eyes.
What's happened?
He stared blankly at the ceiling in front of him.
He remembers that he was supposed to lead the team on the ruined platform and fight the most powerful boss of the Dragon Soul, and successfully got the first kill, he is sure he got the achievement and the system, and then the last shot of the Dragon Dragon took his life.
As originally planned, Rod would be resurrected to the cemetery, and then go down the line.
But as soon as he was killed by the empty dragon, the whole world instantly turned into a darkness, as if forced to be isolated, and then Rod lost consciousness.
How is that possible?
What's wrong with the game?
Rod turned his head and saw from the window the blue sky and the white clouds outside, where was he?
What is this place?
What exactly happened?
Is he still dreaming?
Or are you still in the game?
At least Rod can be sure this place is definitely not his own small rented apartment.
Thinking of this, doubt immediately poured into Rod's heart, he frowned, then tried to sit up.
"Wow!"
Just then, a huge pain came out of Rod's chest, and he bit his toothbrush and stopped.
Only then did Rod find that his left shoulder and chest had been completely bandaged, although he did not know what had happened, but from the stain that was pervading above, he was clearly injured.
It's definitely not a game!
Rod can be sure of this, knowing that although technology is now quite advanced, as the world's first virtual all-round network, the Dragon is also using a lot of high-tech technology.
However, according to the rules, it is impossible for the player to experience pain, which is to separate the reality from the game, and also to reduce the threshold for the player.
Instead of pain, when a player is injured, the game uses a series of warnings and reminders that interfere with the player's normal game, such as blocking his eyes with a dangerous red, rather than simulating pain.
This behavior has caused considerable controversy in society since the emergence of full-spectrum imaging technology.
Rod lowered his head and looked at his right hand, which was not the role he had shaped in the game, not the one full of muscles and wild bodies.
On the contrary, this arm in front of us is thin and weak, because of the lack of sunlight in the year, the skin is somewhat diseased pale.
It's his body in reality, he's aware of.
But how did you get hurt?
And it's not like a hospital?
Rod looked up and the whole room looked like a cabin, with no lights, no telephones, no calls.
A wooden table, two chairs, and a cabinet fixed to the wall are all the homework here.
I don't know why Rod feels like he's seen the scene somewhere.
And it was when Rod looked at the room, that the door suddenly opened.
A blonde girl in her white dress entered the room, and looked at half-seated Rod, and opened her eyes to some surprise.
Are you awake?
That's good!
What the girl said was not Chinese or English, but Rod could clearly understand what she was saying.
This was surprising to Rod, who knew the language.
This is one of the official languages of the Dragon.
How are you feeling?
But the girl didn't care about Rod's expression, she quickly went to Rod's side, carefully examined his left shoulder and chest.
"Your wounds are so severe, frankly, that I am a little worried about you being able to hold on..."
"This is..."
Rhode frowned, but he didn't know what to say, and turned his head, and looked at the mirror beside the wall, where his face was clearly reflected, and that was indeed his face, but it shouldn't have been here.
Have you forgotten?
The blonde blinked her eyes with some suspicion, the tail on both sides also accompanied her movement slightly, the blue eyes clear, to give one a feeling of life.
"Two days ago, you fell in the hills of Pafield, and suffered a very serious injury.
"I'm afraid it would have been rather strange if the merchant vessel of the silver merchant hadn't passed by.
"I don't know what you're fighting with," he said. "It was a very dangerous time," he said.
Wait, left shoulder?
Rhode washed his eyes, and immediately thought, was it not the left that he had been attacked at the end of his battle with the Emperor?
But it's the player who's injured, and it shouldn't have anything to do with the player himself, but now it's the player who's injured?
Although the situation is a mess, but Rod quickly calm down, this is the psychological quality of him as a top player and the world's most powerful board president.
In his conversation with the blonde in front of him, Rhode also learned of his present situation, where he was heavily wounded in the plains of Pafield, and the silver merchant's floating vessel passed by and rescued him.
According to the blonde, Rod was not optimistic at first, but his recovery was quite good.
My name is Li, and I am a member of the Lunar Corps, a spirit,
Just call me Li.
The girl introduced herself to Rod.
My name is Rod Allen.
Although there was no way to settle the situation before, Rod was a little hesitant, and reported his identity and ID in the game.
"He's an adventurer from the Eastern Mountains."
Adventurer, that's why you're alone in such a remote mountain.
When she heard Rod's answer, she was not surprised, because on this continent there are many adventurers who like to explore on their own, so there was no big problem with the Rod's identity.
But what are you fighting with?
"Why do you get such a big wound?
"I remember there weren't any very scary monsters in this area," he said.
Hearing the girl's inquiry, Rod laughed a little hard.
What could he have said that he had been injured in a battle with one of the so-called Creation's Five Dragons?
"Because I was attacked at night, I didn't know what the other was, they were so many, and they were so fast, I thought, that maybe it was something over there.
"I understand.
Although Rod did not give any details, Li seemed to understand what was going on, then she examined Rod's wound carefully, and that was when she stood up.
"I don't have dinner for two days. I think you must be very hungry.
"Oh, yes, I have to report to the chief, and I think he will come to see you soon."
At the end of the saying, the girl was very polite, nodded to Rod, and then turned out of the room.
CHAPTER II
"Call..."
Only then did Rod grow up and lay back again.
After talking to the girl, Rod has been able to confirm that this is indeed the world of the Dragon.
Moreover, this is not the age I have experienced before, but a far more distant past-the year of the dawn, in the game time, that is, the time when the Dragon Age game has just begun to be announced.
How did you get here?
Rod sighed, shook his head, no more to think about these mysterious things, anyway, he has come here, it is a fact.
Then what should I do?
First, Rod decided to try what he could do at the moment.
He just thought about it, and soon a clear, familiar system was revealed, which showed exactly his present state and attributes:
Rhode
Level 1
Race: Mixed
Unresolved
Race Award
Racial Character: Unresolved ++
Profession: Caller (hero)
Vocational Skill
Hold Swords : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :
Part-time : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :
This is a very normal attribute, especially when you see the first one, Rod almost makes a sound.
Mixed? Why mixed?
Blood is not a common blood between races similar to Earth, on the contrary, it is common to have the characteristic of a common blood, most of which is produced by intermarriage between races other than humans.
But it was clear to Rod that he was a man, and that even in the role of the player, he had not chosen any other race.
But why do you now have more than one mixed blood? And the question mark behind the brackets represents that blood has not fully awakened, so race rewards and race characteristics are also sealed.
This means that Rod must understand what kind of blood he possesses and be able to gain after awakening the power of sleep in the bloodstream.
This can be a problem for Rod, because the general race reward is provided after the person is created.
Like humans, race rewards include shorter time to learn skills, and different additions according to race, such as anti-drugs, enhancement of reputation, etc.
But now, these rewards and characteristics are already isolated from Rod.
But it wasn't surprising either, because in the sword and alchemy column, Rod found that besides his level-required skills, the dozen sword and alchemy skills he had learned as a player weren't forgotten, but were quietly listed below, although they were all dark, indicating that he wasn't able to learn and use them at his current level of ability,
But it doesn't worry Rod, as long as his strength increases, after reaching the conditions, then can again get the use of these swords and skills.
Of course, the only shortcomings in the U.S. are that the skill of these swords and skills has also been restored to the lowest level E, not SS.
However, Rod did not keep these small things in mind, because the most important of these skills is not because of their proficiency, but because of their source, many swords are quite difficult to learn, not only need to upgrade or attributes, often to complete a series of tasks, or to raise their reputation, or simply to find hidden items.
It takes a lot of money, time, even luck.
In the game, until Rod's last year on the Dragon's Land, he had completely built up his own character, and thus had to challenge the grasp of the empty dragon.
Unfortunately, with joy, the problem of swordsmanship was solved, but Rod soon found that he was not only the experience, the rank and the skill, but also the most important thing for summoning swordmen-- summoning spirits.
In this game, summon swordsman is a contentious profession, at the beginning, it is an official launch, the player exclusive profession, and the attention of the public.
However, after being really good, summoning swords is considered one of the most addictive occupations by the players because of the combination of magic and the complexity of summoning spirits to accompany attacks, as well as the consumption of three aspects of experience during the upgrade process.
From a literal point of view, the summon of the swords and the summon of the witch seem to be no different, but in fact the two are distinct, the witch's summon is to consume their power, to tear space, to summon sub-level creatures, to use the power of magic to force them to serve themselves.
Unlike the summoned swords, they do not have the ability to tear up space, and all their summons come from the present world.
One ability is that by summoning the swords' unique "calling spells", they can re-awaken their souls from items that have a long history and are full of mystery and soul power, and use them to re- seal them in the form of a contract.
Although it sounds very strong, but there is a lot of trouble, in fact, at first many players were confused by this skill and chose to summon swords, in their opinion, as long as they buy back some damaged ancient objects at a low price in the remains or in the shop, then use summon spirits to summon the souls of those weapons, then they can get a deity without having to waste the power of ashes.
Unfortunately, dreams are beautiful, reality is cruel, not to mention the ancient level of weapons remains only high-level summoning spirits can activate their sleeping souls, and as souls they have lost their physical form, so the power is much weaker than was the original time.
It was only after he had completed his level that he extracted the soul from a weapon's remains, but the weapons that had accumulated at that time were no more powerful than those that the Forge Master had produced, and it took him two full years to run east to west across the Dragon's Land, before he was able to reactivate the soul of all the fragments on the weapon and restore it to its original form, not to mention the time, the brutality of the process, and enough for many to look back.
Furthermore, the use of spirit weapons requires the consumption of spirit power to maintain, and the summoned spirits also need the consumption of spirit power, but the summoned swords themselves reserve the spirit power far more than the wizards, so many summoned swords end up choosing ordinary weapons, and not using this "looks beautiful", but in fact does not much help the spirit weapons.
In addition to this, there are three sources of summoning spirits: one takes the core of the soul that is condensed after the death of the magic creature, and makes it its own summoning spirit.
However, this can change due to the owner's own attributes and the influence of factors such as the environment.
For example, if a summoned swordsman gets the core of the soul when he kills a fire snake, but he summons the soul in ice and snow or in any other environment, or in a dark-attributed outfit, then it is uncertain what kind of monster he will eventually summon.
If nine snakes have dark powers, it's good, but if it's the kind of ordinary monster that loses power because of its attributes, then it's just crying.
The second way to get a summoned spirit is to defeat the non-human creatures, who, after meeting certain conditions, can also sign a contract with them and seal them up for use as their own summoned spirits.
This is also a more common way of summoning swords, but the disadvantage is that this kind of summoning creature is too autonomous, and if it is in the game, the performance is likely to be against the order of its summoner based on its own judgment.
Of course, this will not be welcomed by anybody, after all, the more helpful the thing that does not want to summon itself.
As for the final method is to awaken attributes after the tenth level adjust the talent, by fusing several summoning spirits to produce higher spirits, this method to some extent controls the summoning spirit itself uncertainty, as long as you are familiar with the characteristics of summoning spirits, race, attributes, then for most of them to become what summon spirits after fusing.
But the disadvantage of this method is that the level of the newly created summoning spirit is uncertain, and it is possible to combine the two higher levels of summoning spirit, resulting in a new summoning spirit of the 1st level, and it is possible to combine a summoning spirit higher than the holder's level, which is unable to be used at all.
If the latter is good, just try to raise your level, if the latter is good, then you delete the number...
The Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master
Because of the characteristics of summoning the swordsman, it is also ranked among the top ten swordsman occupations in the official forum of Dragon's Land, and some have given the swordsman's operators an image of a person who plays summoning the swordsman, or the kind of bird who has never played a game, introduced and CG advertised to cheat in.
Or the kind of casual player that doesn't want to go up.
It's the gamblers.
And the last one is...
Rod.
Just by changing the game ID from a simple name to a phenomenon, you can learn what it feels like to be the first of countless servers to summon the Swordsman, the world-acclaimed father of monsters, when he has conquered three new eras.
Usually players don't like this kind of randomness, which gives them a feeling they don't have in their hands, but Rod likes it, because it's unknown and it's challenging, which is why he chose to call the swordsman.
In fact, in his long game career, all of the summons of the Swordsman's "Dad" showed that he had met almost all, but Rod was not tired, because only conquering such difficulties would make him more satisfied.
But now, he has spent a full seven years cultivating dozens of top summoning spirits, all cleared, and the mysterious summoning array on the back of his right hand still exists, but in it, Rod has not felt any trace of the spirits.
But it's no wonder that body is after all not the body of the game, and can not force too much.
But...
With this in mind, Rod did not move, and then he stretched out his hand, and touched his chest pocket, and, indeed, he soon touched a card.
It was a white card, depicted on it, a long sword, wrapped in thorns, and of pure white, engraved on it with complex and elaborate engravings, and guarded by a pair of delicate wings, which seemed only to give one a sense of delight,
There are four different marks in the four corners of the board, in the upper right corner, is a white half circle, and in the upper left corner is written a small X, and then looking down, the lower left corner and the lower right corner have two small numbers - 3.
Turn the card, a mysterious, elegant word slowly appeared on the back of the card.
[Eternal Sword,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is he still?
Looking at the card in his hand, Rod paused. It was the special equipment calling the swordsman, calling the card.
And this is also very familiar, this is the official gift of his rare card when he was participating in the game, after he won the first all-server for two consecutive quarters, in order to honor this incredibly strong top player, the game company specially created for him such a card.
Sure, there's been a lot of sea around cards like this, but for Rod, there's no such thing as wasting money on things you can't see, so he's got only this prize,
Of course Rod got it as a protective belt around, and it didn't take any place anyway.
Originally, it was a very ordinary souvenir except for one in the world, but at this moment Rod saw its surface shining in his hand with a faint light.
Would you like to try it?
Rhode hesitated for a second, then his right hand held the card, then the magic line attached to the back of Rhode's right hand suddenly lit up, and a blue magic line spread out from it, extending to every finger of the right hand, then the white card burst into bright white light, then became a little dust, and disappeared completely into the air.
And now a system appeared before Rod's eyes.
[Have received the Eternal Ring 1, The Eternal Sword 10 - Star Mark]
"Call..."

In the game, prior to level 15, it is rare to find weapons with +2 abilities, and "Star Trek" has the initial attribute of+3, which is enough to make the original summon swordsman semi-dead compared to the original swordsman.
In addition to its fusable characteristics, it means that as long as you find the right spirit, you can turn it into an attribute weapon.
Although the characteristics of calling cards that require the holder to consume the power of the soul to use, it is somewhat less than normal weapons, but only by means of attacking power, it is already a rare force equipment at present.
It's just hard for Rod to be completely excited, because for him, the situation in which he's involved, is very strange.
Is this a game?
Is It Real?
If it's real, then where do you go?
"Hmm."
A knocked on the door.
Rod looked up and saw a middle-aged man pushing into the door, dressed in an adventurer's jacket, with his long red hair casually trimmed back, and saw Rod, the man smiling slightly.
Hello, sir, I'm the commander of the Star-Saturn Mission, Carter.
Chapter Three
Hello, Mr. Carter.
Rod raised his head and smiled at the man before him.
"Thank you for your help."
"It's a labor, don't worry."
He was tall with red hair, and had a little bit of a backward comb, and he should have been born in the northwestern part of the country as a Lecat.
Two long swords hung quietly on both sides of his waist. The firmness and discernment revealed by the sharp edges of his face could prove that this man was not an ordinary man.
While Rod looked at the other, Cat was quietly assessing the man before him.
It's easy to think of him as a kind of uneducated noble brother, and it's no wonder that his weakness, his pale skin, and his long, somewhat womanlike face, and his clothes, make him look no more than an adventurer on an outward journey, but more like a rich two-generation who go out all day to seek stimulation and play.
But Carter thinks the young man doesn't seem to be so simple, and for that reason, he's on his right back with the strange and mysterious formula.
Liz, a psychic, could feel the magic from there, indicating that was not a commodity, but with all the years of experience with Card, he rarely saw anyone directly inscribe a magical array on his body.
As you can see, the identity of this young man is not easy.
Moreover, from the previous short conversation, Carter noticed that the young man's attitude was neither arrogant nor lowly, and his expression was very calm.
Listen, said Li, for a few dozen minutes since he was awakened from his drowsiness, he was able to grasp his present state so calmly, and for that alone, he was more than the ignorant, arrogant, noble sons.
"I hear you come from Eastern Mountains?"
"Yes."
Rod nodded.
Then where are you going?
"I'm just traveling around.
Rhode shrugged.
"I'm an adventurer, and it's my life to venture freely.
Of course, please rest assured, I will not bring any trouble for you.
It'll be fine.
Now that's been said by Rod, Carter hasn't spoken much, they're still on their mission, and naturally they don't want to do anything new.
So, after a few more words to make him feel better, Carter said nothing more, and soon quit, after all, he had much to do as a commissioner, and it was not possible to always waste time here.
The next few days were relatively uneventful for Rod, who was somewhat interested in what she had brought, although it was only ordinary white bread and dried meat, and Rod had eaten many times in the game, but it was "false" and only served to restore the character's life and spirit, without any flavor or filling.
Now it's a fresh experience to experience the taste of white bread and dried meat in a food comment.
But I have to say that tastes better than what is described in the notes.
"How do you feel? Is the wound still sore?"
Sitting on Rod's side, the blonde with anxious and serious expression, looked at the young man in front of him, with a little of anxious eyes on his shoulder, a little unbearable.
It's all right now.
' said Rod, holding his left hand, and the pain from his chest was not so intense at first, and at first he felt a little difficult even to breathe, but now he was much better.
It'll be fine.
When she heard Rod's answer, her nervous expression was much more relaxed.
"But you still need to rest," he said. "When we get to deep rock city, the conditions will be much better," he said.
The girl's expression was very serious, though lying in front of herself but a stranger who had just met, but looking at her expression, it was evident that she did not care about this little idea.
"Thank you.
Don't be rude. That's what I should have done.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"So..."
Liz did not say anything, because at that moment, the ship was shaken.
The girl's body wasted, and she fell into the bed, but at the last moment she stretched out her hand, and lifted her head from the bed.
The two looked at each other saw from the eyes of the other.
Although aerial vessels operate by the power of the winds, and the sky is not like the ocean, there are no dark reefs, there is not necessarily any danger.
The situation is obviously not normal.
I'll go see. You can rest here.
Leigh said in a low voice, then immediately turned away, closed the door, and looking at her back, Rod smiled, and opened his mouth, but said nothing.
Is it necessary to speak to yourself in such a way as to make children look like her?
But the next moment, a figure flew from outside the window, but made the look of Rod suddenly become serious.
He turned his head slightly and stared carefully outside the string window.
Soon, three four green figures flew from outside, and at the same time, a low noise seemed to appear.
"I-"
But when he heard this, Rod washed himself.
They're in trouble!
At this moment, the deck is already a mess.
"I didn't think we'd come across these dead things.
The commander of the Red, with his swords, stood in front of him, looking solemnly at the green figures that flew around the floating ship.
Their appearance looks like a snake of bat wings, about one meter long, although the slightly weak body gives one a feeling of weakness without wind, but the sharp poison teeth revealed from the open mouth can overturn the conclusion in the shortest time.
The Wind.
"It looks like we've broken into the snake's territory.
The fat merchant lurked beside the captain of the mercenary, whose pale, shivering handkerchief wiped the sweat from his forehead.
Damn it, that cunning Bick, I knew, I knew that bastard would give me such a way, but with so little money!
It's a murder!
When I come back, I must let him know how great I am!
Wait for us to get out of the circle and say again!
Carter interrupted the fury of the fat merchants near Heathrow, and looked at the hundreds of wind-snakes that surrounded the merchant ship, and at the outset ordered his men to use the crossbows to try to frighten the monsters.
But the spirit of "death as a return" is truly beyond his imagination, or that the death of his companions instead provoked the cruelty of these monsters, now that they have occupied the outer side of the deck and are beginning to penetrate inside.
And the mercenaries had thrown away their bow and began to wrestle with each other by waving their arms.
You hide inside and tell the captain we need to get out of here as soon as possible!
Carter pushed the fat merchant back into the captain's room. Then he took the first two steps, his long sword waving a piece of snow, and knocked down a roaring snake, but quickly the second one jumped up.
There are too few people!
Carter frowned, swept over the deck, and this time he had only six men on his mission, and these six men, although the merchant vessel itself had guards, had little experience.
Looking at those terrible monsters, Cart's face froze.
He didn't have any experience with the Snakes, but it was the first time that he had seen such a number, and it made Carter feel a little nervous.
He made another half-step, turned his body flexibly into a half-circle, then cut his sword sharply to the side, and heavily struck the snake, and under the splash of blood, the wounded snake fell heavily on the ground, and after a few unpleasant hisses, it became a cold corpse.
Carter lifted his head, consciously glanced around, and then his heart blew.
"Lizzy!
Be careful!
The girl did not respond at first.
Having just healed herself from therapist, she had just taken off her hands, and the girl's mentality was a bit of an ecstasy, for she had only been on the deck for a few minutes, but had had a number of injured, and as the only healing spirit among them, she had taken on her responsibilities, naturally, with a great deal of grace.
After hearing Carter's warning, the girl turned her head in confusion.
Then what she saw was a big, open mouth with sharp, poisonous teeth.
In that moment, the girl's blood froze, she stared at the wind snake in front of her, brain blank, completely unknown how to react.
In her eyes, Li had a clear sight of sharp, shining, poisonous teeth, and of the flesh-the inner wall, even of the smell.
At this moment, a hand suddenly stretched from behind, grasped Lijee's collar, and pulled her away at the moment of a sudden.
Chapter Four
The Snake bit the air.
It was nearly there, had it not been for Rod's sudden appearance from behind.
"Mr.
Liz, who had escaped from death, lifted her head, and was surprised to find that Rod was standing behind her, and she was leaning in the arms of the other, not knowing whether it was because of the overwhelming fear, that the girl at this moment found herself underneath all the softness, not half the strength.
She consciously wanted to stand up, but a soft leg, but instead sat down.
"Lie!"
Seeing her escape from her death, Cat also relaxed, but soon, his heart again became tense.
For now the flying snake had turned its head, opened its wings, raised its head, and intended to attack again.
Damn!
He grabbed his sword and ran to the two, hoping to get there-but he didn't seem to get there anyway.
Looking at the snake again, the girl inadvertently shut her breath, she wanted to do something, but did not know what to do.
As a spirit, she does not use weapons, and does not carry arms around.
Well, what now?
Give it to me.
Just as Lizzy wasted, her ears heard the sound of Rod, and then the girl saw Rod coming halfway up, standing in front of herself.
Was he going to fight the wind snake with a blank hand?
Just as Li was wondering, she saw Rod extending his right hand.
It was then that Li noticed that on Rod's right hand, a complex, gorgeous array was shining bright magic, a line spreading from it to every finger, a semi-transparent, card-like thing emerging from the centre of Rod's palm.
Afterwards, Rod held back his hand.
A white brightness suddenly appeared.
The Invisible Power unlocked the seal and turned into a shaped wave of air spreading all around. The first wind snake screamed at the tip of its wings, trying to keep balance in the midst of this fierce wind.
But before he could make any further moves, a brilliant light came out of the waves, heavily cut on the body of the wind snake, and blown it away completely.
"Call..."
Rhode washed his mouth, and at this moment the glory of his eyes washed away, and his right hand was replaced by an exquisite, transparent, white sword.
He waved the dust sword in his hand, point dust slowly descending from the sword, for a time created an enchanting scene.
He didn't notice, and the others were now completely frightened.
Leigh sat still on the ground, looking at the man standing before her, and Cart slowed down, looking at Rod with astonishment and astonishment, though he had already noticed that the other was not ordinary, but had never thought that he would be so "ordinary".
Even though she still sat on the ground, she couldn't help admiring the long sword, which was clean and unblemished, with the old-fashioned prints on the long sword, and with its weak light, and even around it, with its clear spots of dust, which were as beautiful as illusions, and with its curved wings, which were as exquisite as ever,
Even a piece of feather is clearly visible.
Although women don't always get cold about weapons, this sword has far exceeded the scope of weapons, and even art.
Lizzy was only appreciating, but Carter's eyes at this moment were a little different.
As an experienced adventurer, he can swear by heaven that he had never seen such a strange thing, and in fact he was stuck when Rod summoned the weapons, and although he had seen some wizards summon, most of them used the existence of crystals,
And you need tos some ancient spells and then summon some ugly monsters, which you see a lot.
But what about summoning weapons? He didn't really see such a scene.
Although it was not clear what was in Rod's hands, it was clear to Carter that this magical weapon could not be used by ordinary people, and that the person who could be qualified to use it must be a noble and special person.
And when he saw the living wings of the sword, he wrinkled his eyes.
He was, of course, clear that on this continent, angels are a very noble group, most of whom are distinguished, or are the strongholds of certain important groups.
It's like three years ago the lord of the Principality of Muen, Lydia Pafield, Mira, and Florence, who's an angel.
Although the young man does not know his true identity at present, the sword can be used to determine that he must have some connection with that noble group.
These thoughts were just flashing through Carter's mind, when he had come to the two.
"It's all right.
I'm still fine.
Leigh's little face was still pale, which could not be blamed for her timidity; after all, had it not been for Rod's pull from behind, the girl would have been dead.
That fear of escaping under the sickle of the dead is certainly not the experience of ordinary people.
After confirming that Liz was not injured, Carter immediately shifted his eyes to the next Rod.
You're all right, Mr. Rod.
Rod shook his head, indicating that he was all right, although his left body suffered in the course of the movement, it had little effect on the fight.
Instead, he cared more about one thing than about his own body.
What are you going to do?
There were more and more snakes around, and even though the floats were moving at full speed, they were still not able to escape most of the snakes' attacks.
Their situation is not improving, it is getting worse.
"We're going to push out of their territory, and until then we've been able to keep going. "
If it were on land, it might be that Carter had a different way of dealing with the problem now that he was in the air, he would have no better way of dealing with the problem now.
But as soon as the Cards came out, the young man in front of him froze.
"I can't come," said Mr. Carter.
"Oh?"
"The wind snakes are absolutely superior in the plains, and even if you speed up, we have no way of getting out before the float breaks down. "
Really?
Carter was not stupid, and made the decision because he himself was not familiar with the place.
As soon as he heard Rod speak, he immediately understood the gravity of the matter.
What should we do then?
"Go down now."
Rod gave the answer almost without hesitation, then he stretched out his hand, pointing to the side.
"And then we'll go in there.
Carter looked in the direction of Rod's fingers, then he opened his eyes to some surprise.
"You mean we're going to the forest at dusk?"
"It's our only way to get rid of the wind snake, and..."
said he, and looked around.
We don't have much time.
The situation is indeed deteriorating.
Their threat is not only their poisonous teeth, which are also deadly with their corrosive toxins, but they are also thin, and they will change their targets immediately if they are unable to win a direct attack.
Now there are many wind snakes breaking glass and drilling into the cabin from below, but in the face of such a situation, there is no way to resist.
Although the small space in the cabin limits the flexibility of the wind snakes, their threat does not decrease as a result.
For this reason, now that there was a wolf in the cabin, as can be seen from the thick smoke that came out of several holes,
Things are pretty bad now!
Carter did not hesitate and turned away immediately.
Rhode grabbed the stars and blocked the gap in front.
"Hoh!"
A Wind Snake flew from the right, and opened his mouth to attack Rod, but just as he was about to come, Rod had already shifted to the left, and at the same time the white long sword of his hand had struck the wind Snake's lower jaw, and he had struck the wind Snake's lower jaw at the same time as he had blocked the poison sprayed by the other in a hurry.
Then Rod turned quickly, and the silver in his hand carried a curtain in the air, and correctly inserted another sword on the wings of the wind snake, which tried to steal from behind, while it lost its balance, and completely ended the life of the poor snake.
But the Snakes' attack did not stop, and the blood was surely stimulating them, and as Rod drew out his long sword from the dead Snake, dozens of Snakes rushed towards him, and they overlapped,
From a distance it was like a green cloud, and like a big mouth open by some unknown monster, which in a moment could completely swallow the prey in sight.
"Mr. Rod!"
To discharge the poison to another, Li, turning, saw the scene, she cried out unconsciously.
A showered out like a rain on Rod, who was afraid of not dying and of losing half his life if it were poured out.
But at this moment, Rod stepped back.
Acid washed over him, dropped on the deck, emitted a little smoke, and corrupted the little holes, but almost at the same time the swarms of wind snakes were running before Rod, and at the next moment they were going to tear apart the dangerous existence before them.
If you were an ordinary man, you'd have seen the scene before, I'm afraid the frightened legs were already soft, but Rod was very calm, faced with the monsters who threw themselves in front of him, trying to tear themselves apart.
The only thing he did was to raise his sword with his right hand and then tos it forward.
Break the blade, start.
The white blades burst out of the swarms of wind snakes, one for two for four, and several of them flew forward, and struck one after another of the wind snakes, and the sweeping strong wind, as if it were an invisible hand, dragged those who were lucky not to be hit, and crumbled their bodies coldly and mercilessly.
Almost in one instant, the green cloud was thus completely torn apart by the brilliant, leaving only a piece of blood.
Everyone stopped breathing at that moment.
Chapter Five
Their fierce attacks were slowed down, but there was such a moment of silence on the deck, filled with anger, screams, and screams.
Everyone looked at the young man with incredible eyes, not knowing exactly what to say.
At that moment, almost everyone thought the young man was dead, they had never seen any man who could withdraw from the siege of dozens of wind snakes.
Of course, that's what high-ranking professionals, or full-armed shield fighters, say.
But the young man doesn't seem to be very old, and he doesn't have any protective equipment at all except for the white long sword in his hand.
But he did.
At this moment, not only the mercenaries, but even Lejee and Cart looked at the young man, with his heart shaking.
Why is he sacred?
It wasn't known if, being deterred by Rod's attack, all the wind-snakes who were still trying to attack the floating ships were dispersed, and at one point, the whole deck was almost silent except for the whistling wind.
The mercenaries were shocked by Rod's performance, but for Rod he didn't care what he had done; on the contrary, at this moment he looked at the pile of bodies beneath his feet, and in his heart he cried out for danger.
Although the Snake is one of the lowest level of monsters, the power itself is not particularly strong, but after all it is a monster that wins by number.
Rod's summoning swords belong to the single-brush profession, but large-the single-brush is not effective, and in fact this is so successful, mainly because of the initial +3 characteristics of his hand, which means that when holding this sword, Rod's characteristics can be raised by three points, three points raised enough to bring the danger level of a monster down from red to green, so for Rod, the elimination of the wind snake falls is not particularly surprising.
But it was a strange thing to think of it, that if it were a human attribute, then even if it had a "streak of stars," it would not have been the autumn wind that wiped out the leaves, and that it would have been the overwhelming advantage, according to his original estimate, that the most crushed blade would have been to sweep the blood out of the swarm of wind snakes, and so he was well prepared to go up and get the sword.
But without thinking about the power of the broken blade far beyond his own imagination, and to sweep the wind snake directly to death?
Aren't their attributes calculated according to human?
With this in mind, Rhode unconsciously removed his attribute table, but unfortunately, his attributes were hidden and unable to be checked before his race had been identified.
Fortunately, this battle gave him a 1900 point of experience, which was surprising to Rhode.
Of course, it was only a few seconds for Rod, who seemed to be just staring at the pile of bodies beneath his feet, silent for a moment, then raised his head again.
And it was at this moment that Rod found himself surrounded by ancient silence, not by the shock of others, but by some more dangerous, deadly existence.
What about the Snakes?
This thought flickered through Rod's mind, and then he seemed to think of something, and hastened to turn and to shout.
Everybody be careful!
At this moment, the floating vessel was shaken.
Severe shocks caused many people to fall directly to the ground, and even two wicked devils did not come to stand, directly lost feet, slid down.
At the same time, the deck of the ship emitted a crisp crack, and immediately, a huge snake head came out of it.
"Be careful, it's the Lord of the Winds!"
At last Carter appeared, he drank aloud, then drew out the swords of his hand, and flew past the giant wind snake.
The other servants stood up in a hurry, and although they were already wounded, they were still clinging to their teeth, following their leader, and trying to attack the great thing.
But Rod's moving faster than all of them.
He squatted, and a row of instructions immediately appeared before him.
[1900/200,,,,,,,,]
[Experience Point 1 700,,,,,,,,,]
[Experience Score 1300 600]
[800/1000,,,,,]

Start.
Rod stood up.
At that instant, all felt only a flower, and then saw a young man who had stood on the ground transformed into a black shadow, as if a blade had been cut across the sky, before even the great wind-snake commander could react, and when Rod jumped up and came before him, the other had even manifested some suspicion--it was evident that he had never encountered a strange situation in which the prey had jumped up and gone to his mouth.
Rod took up his long sword, and at that moment the glow of the dust as if attracted by the invisible gravity washed up on the white and vacant body of his sword, and then he struck down the brass-bell-sized eyes of the Lord of the Wind-Snake.
"Broken Blade!"
Faced with the light of the sword, the master of the wind snake's first reaction was to evade, after raising the sword of the moon continuously four proficiency, the blade of the broken, both in quantity and in strength, has risen more than one step, dozens of silver and white light blades in that instant burst out of the sword, circling the shot forward.
One, Two, Three.
At first, the Snake Master's hardened scales barely resisted the first blade of the sword, but even with his master's level of protection, only to insist on twenty sword marks completely collapsed.
Then came the sword light and easy to tear the scales and the flesh, and pierced its body.
Although the Snake had a large body, Rod was very clever in choosing a break, and under his control, the blade did not disperse as before, but concentrated on the neck of the other, and successfully broke the defense of the other.
Their Master raised his head, staring dead at Rhode, and then opened his mouth.
Rod's shadow, once again turned into a hallucination, and as he retreated away, a poison of an immense smell came straight up, wiping through Rod's remains, spraying on the rear mast, and soon, under the corrosion of that poison, the mast, which had been rough and hard, melted completely in just a few seconds, and then collapsed.
After all, BOSS is.
According to Rod's experience, the average level of the Snake is about three, and its leader is usually ten, and the nearest BOSS should not be more than ten.
Although it was not difficult to defeat the BOSS by means of the covering of Card and the mercenaries, after the sword, Rhode realized that it was probably not an ordinary master level monster, but an elite, after all, if it was an ordinary master monster, Rhode's sword was sufficient to cut off its wings.
But in fact, despite all that Rod had done, he had left only a deep-seated scar, which was very clear about the problem.
Go attack its wings and keep as close as possible to its mouth!
Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord
Previously healed left chest now burning pain, seems to have ruptured again.
If there were any deaths due to the destruction, then it would be a joke that would not make anyone cry.
And even though he's only 5 now, for Rod, as long as the other player's level is no more than 15, he's confident in the fight.
After all, there are three occupations in the Dragon's mainland, which are known for their superior brush, magicians, travelers, and the last one is summoning swords.
Magicians are known for their magic, and they are powered by "flying kites" at great distances, and they are powered by "flying kites" at great distances at great distances at great distances are known for their magicians are known for their magicians are known as the greats are known as the greats are known as the greats are known as the greats are known as the great is known as the great is known as the great is known as the great is known as the great is known as the great is known as great is known as great as great is known as great as great Grand Masters are known as great as great Grand Masters are known as the great Grand Masters are known as the Grand Master, and Grand Master is known as the Grand Master, and Grand Master is known as the Grand Master, Grand Master, Grand Master, Grand Master, Grand Master, Grand Master, Grand Master, Grand Master,
Nevertheless, these three occupations have their disadvantages—the wizards with no magic are no different from the targets, and even a group of low-level fairies can beat them to death, and the approach of the wizards is a complete tragedy, and the summoning of the swords is too random, and the operations are too complicated, to the point where there are almost no models to follow.
That's why the three professions didn't reach the clouds in the game, and that's what's closer to the real-life setting of the Dragon-either betting on a non-routine path, or on a steady slow path, where players can decide their fate and their future at their own discretion.
The Lord of Nights is the ten-class elite BOSS, but because of the marks he holds in his hand, it has a maximum of defense of less than sixty-seven degrees, so that in defense, Rod does not worry about sufficient damage, but in attack...
"Come!"
The fierce wind lifted.
Rod's body washed away with a series of remains, and he was able to avoid the wings of the other.
And when the wings were blown, they fell upon the deck heavily, and immediately the hard and thick deck fell into a great hole.
It's worthy of the 10th class.
Rhode wiped his cold sweat, and he was only fifth, and he had no equipment, and if he was wiped like this, I was afraid that even the King would not be saved.
Although he's also worried about Cats and others, but fortunately for the moment, it's probably because he's done a lot of damage to it. He's obviously putting all his hatred on himself, and unfortunately he's been watching a BOSS with such a high attack power, and for a non-tank career, the pressure is really great...
His Soul Power had been reduced to a third, and Rod was feeling a little tired, and although he had expected the battle to be difficult when he saw the Lord of the Winds, the pressure was too great, and he needed a flash to help himself escape the attack, for at his present speed, to escape the attack of the Lord of the Winds was a matter of night and day.
But on the other hand, he also needs a broken blade to cause damage to overcome the intractable existence in the shortest time.
But it doesn't look like it's going to be easy.
The floating vessel was slowly lowering its altitude, but under the attack of the Lord of the Winds, it was occasionally swinging, like a small boat in the waves, it was discouraging.
There were already two commissioners so they were thrown out of sight.
Carter was still trying to drive out the Snake Master, his swords dancing in front of him, flexibly attacking the Snake Master's side, but was unsuccessful.
I'm afraid they'll have no way to keep up until now, if it wasn't for the healing light that Lizzy gave the mercenaries from time to time.
There must be a way, or else, before the float falls, I am afraid it will be torn apart by this damned snake.
Thinking about it,Rod bit his lips.
Their attack was not weakened, and their wings were extended, and the two claws on the upper edges of the boat were caught dead on the edges.
Although Rod's previous attacks caused him considerable damage, as a lord-level monster, he is of course unable to retreat due to this injury.
On the contrary, the cunning Snake Master seemed to have noticed the weakness of the enemy in front of him, and two sharp claws grasped deadly the outer wall of the floating ship, shaking and dragging the prey in his hand.
Although the hull was not so fragile, it was already heavily damaged in the previous battle with the Snake Group, and the whirling tide hit the hull, causing it to begin some distortion.
Even on the deck there were several striking cracks, which gave rise to a chilling crack.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh!
Benched in the corner of the captain's room, the fat merchant stared with trembling, outward, at the terrifying wind-snake master, whose voice had become somewhat distorted by tension and fear.
"That damn Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard Richard
And you too! What is so terrible that you don't wake me up?
The captain didn't respond to the fat merchant's rage. He was now holding the rudder and staring straight ahead.
At the same time, deep in his heart, he cursed the goddamn scoundrel, before reminding him that this time of the voyage is very likely to attract the swarm of wind snakes, but the guy didn't think.
It's all right now, when death comes, he's blaming himself! He knew it was going to happen, and he shouldn't have taken this job at first!
CHAPTER VI
It's awful.
Both Rod and Cat had the same thought at this moment, that it was very difficult for the lord of the snake to be involved, that although the float was falling rapidly, and that it could be seen clearly in the forest of nowhere, that as it went, I was afraid that the float had not yet come down to the ground, and that it would be dissolved in the air!
Drink!
Before Cat flew, the two swords in his hand crossed the air two cold lights, directly hit the giant claws of the Lord of the Winds, but just before he got the hand, the Lord of the Winds suddenly opened his mouth, Cat felt only a smell of coming on the face,
Before he could even confirm it, he rolled straight away, despite escaping the whisper of the Snake Master, but also proclaiming the defeat of the attack.
But just as Carter stood up and tried to get out of the space, the Snake commander seemed to find the little insect too annoying, and all of a sudden a claw hit him.
Carter, who had no expectation of the Snake's master's release from the ship, was somewhat uncomfortable, and consciously lifted his swords to resist, but was blown away by the weight.A few meters after slid on the deck, it hit the mast, and stopped.
You can't go down like this.
'Rod frowned, then looked at the anxious girl standing not far behind.
I need your help!
"Oh?"
"I will draw its attention, and when it attacks me, I hope you can give me a protective shield!"
All right!
When she heard Rod's words, she did not hesitate to raise her head.
She held her hands tight, bright soft light floating now on her body.
Seeing this scene, Rod said nothing more, he turned his head, then raised his long sword, and thought of stabbing him.
Broken Blade.
The S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
Theraptor's action was sharp, and he turned quickly, his red eyes burning with anger, staring dead at the young man on the deck, and then he opened his mouth again, and flew to Rod.
The Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind Wind
He deliberately did not use flashes, but kept moving at a slower pace, in order to tempt the Snake's leader to take the initiative, although this would be a great danger, but when the enemy attacks at its full strength, its weaknesses would be evident - this was the opportunity that Rod wanted to seize!
The Lord of the Wind Snake's bowels were near, and as soon as a few more seconds, Rod would be swallowed by it, but it was still unable to achieve its goal.
For at this moment, a pale, shining, egg-shaped barrier appeared upon Rod, and blocked the Lord of the Winds' teeth, which, though the Lord of the Winds had slowed down, at the next moment had completely broken the barrier, but it had not bit anything.
Because it's when the guardian's shield is covered, Rod has already started the flash.
He, like a ghost's shadow, flew past the snake's master's bite, then lifted up his pure white sword, and cut it from his throat.
This is the weakness of the master of the wind snake, and is the most vulnerable part of its body up and down, but before it is one is shrinking its neck, so it is difficult to attack.
And this time, the Lord of the Winds, angry with Rhode, was completely disengaged from the attack, and for that reason, he had no more time to protect himself from the deadliest weakness.
There was a sharp cry, and the Lord of the Winds seemed to have been electrocuted, and he generally raised his head, and in his throat, a stain of blood poured out, and filled the whole deck.
Then, as soon as its body was soft, it fell so heavily on the deck that there was no more breath.
Just then, Rod saw a deep green, expanding rapidly before his eyes.
"Bow!"
Then he felt a trembling of the ship, and his body seemed to float in the air for a moment.
Afterwards, in the darkness of Rod's eyes, he completely lost consciousness.
When he woke up again, the first thing he felt was a chill.
"I am..."
Open eyes, first reflected in eyes, is a beautiful night sky.
Unlike ordinary nights, these nights are very bright, and gentle moonlight shines down, reflecting the shadows of each leaf on the ground.
In the night sky, apart from the dot stars, there was a path of light in which they converged to form a light cord, extending on all sides.
This is the characteristic of the dragon-according to ancient legends, it was originally a chaotic, dangerous space.
Then five giants came here, and they created heaven, earth, and all things with their own bodies in this space that was originally empty.
In order to suppress the evil chaos, the five giants, after creating the world with the body, they also put their souls into it, to suppress the evil chaotic power, and to protect the order of the world.
Each dragon's spirit has its own unique form, as if the sky above Rod's head now represented a protective area belonging to the dragon's spirit of light.
Its characteristic is that even in the darkness, there will be light shining.
In contrast, there is a protective area of the dark dragon, where, even during the day, there is a darkness, and no light shadow can be seen.
For this reason, the distribution of species on the mainland is also quite regular.
In the area guarded by the dragon soul, you can see the growth of various green plants.
But in the dark dragon's soul can only see the traces of the plants of the night.
Of course, this characteristic also affects the distribution of races on the continent, most of whom are gathered under the guardianship of the dragon spirits of light, followed by spirits and angels.
Deaths, Vampires, and Nightmares are the natural inhabitants of the dark kingdom.
There is no divinity on this continent, and if it is hard to say, then the five giants of heaven and earth are the objects they believe in.
Likewise, this includes the holder of the dragon spirit.
Souls have their core, even the giants who create the world, and their soul core, will lodge in a person, and this person can use this power to adjust the dragon soul's guardianship of the continent.
For example, if chaos is a virus, and the power of the dragon is a firewall, then the person holding the core of the soul is the same as the CPU, and as long as the CPU is still capable of computing, the firewall will not fail, sufficient to completely prevent all the power of chaos from going out into the world.
Those who hold the core of these souls are also considered to be the inheritors of the souls of the giants.
But this doesn't mean anything to Rod now.
Rod rose slowly, and his body washed with intense pain, especially his left chest wound, which now seemed to be more serious.
Before, Rod was able to move with his left hand, but now he can't move even with his finger, and feels like his whole arm is buried in the sea of pain.
But this puts Rod down, feeling that his arm is still, if anything doesn't feel, that's the big trouble.
Raising his head, through the bright moonlight, Rod first saw the remains of the floating ship, and the tall trees around them showed that they were in the forest.
And then it's clear what's happened.
Despite Rod's killing the master, the already fragile float was destroyed while falling due to its inability to withstand severe impact.
There was silence in the forest, and not even the sound of the insects could be heard, and Rod looked around, and saw only on the ground, where there were signs of blood and bodies, of wind snakes, and of men.
And not far from Rod, there lay a delicate figure, which did not move.
"Lie!"
Rod rushed to the girl's side, fell to look at her situation, fortunately, the girl looked pale, hands tight.
But her breathing was even, and under Rod's call, not too long the girl opened her eyes.
"I..." "I am..."
She opened her eyes, and looked at the man in front of her, and after a while she seemed to have recovered, and it seemed that she had fallen too little.
Am I still alive?
"Yes," he said.
Looking at her reply, Rhode put down his mind, and the girl slowly stood up, shaking her head, gripping her lips, as if she had not fully recovered; but for the girl there was something more important to do.
What about all of you?
What about the chief?
Rod didn't answer, but Li did not need to answer, because at this moment she had seen clearly the situation around her.
The little face, which was originally pale, now looked extremely stiff.
"How can..." "Crit," "Sar," "Commander!"
The girl rushed to the corpses of the mercenaries and cried out for their names, but no one responded.
However, Liz did not give up, she squatted down, carefully examined the commissioner before her, and after confirming the other had died, she did not cry, but bite the toothbrush, and ran to the next one.
However, the girl's efforts have not received their due.
She couldn't do anything in front of those bodies that were already cold and stiff.
Despite her persistence, when she saw the figure of Carter, she was unable to soften her feet and sit down.
Formerly thermal commissioner, now also a cold corpse.
Half of his body washed away in the gap of the deck, and a cracked pile passed through his belly.
"The group...
Commander..."
Looking at the scene, Li Li sat still on some wet grass, the hopeful seeds had been completely extinguished from her eyes, and in her place, was confusion and sadness.
Finally, the girl lowered her head, though she did not speak, but the little cry that was brought by the night wind, passed on to Rod's ears.
Looking at the little blonde's shivering shoulder, Rod stood silently behind her, but could not say a word.
Previously in combat, for reasons of life and death, he didn't care about these at all. But now, when everything was over, looking around at the bodies, Rod was unable to feel complicated.
He didn't see the body, but after all it's just a simulation of the game, where the dead can be resurrected by magic, or the soul can run away,
But this isn't a game. people die and don't come back to life.
dead, dead.
At this moment, Rod seemed to recall the night of seven years ago, when he could only watch with open eyes, but was powerless-death passed by him steadfastly, but he could not even stop it.
Just as he was about to say something to comfort the girl in front of him, suddenly, a faint cry came.
"Hey.
"Are there any?"
Chapter 7
Meas, awkwardly sitting by the fire, the fat face revealed helplessness and sadness, he wanted to burn, but did not know who to burn.
On the other side of the pile, Rod was quietly leaning on the trunk, keeping his eyes closed.
Li Ji was preparing her food, and though her expression seemed to be calm, the red eyes were telling her everything
Unknowing whether he was lucky or not, he was the only lucky man in the disaster, except for Rod and Leigh. As a businessman who often goes out, he had some saving magical tools, and before the fall of the floating ship, the protective decoration in his hands showed its good and stable function, so that the fat businessman was instead the least injured of the three--
Rod himself hasn't been hurt before, after such a fierce fight, plus the wounds, add to the snow frost.
And there's nothing good about Lizzy, which she didn't find until she was nervous, and it wasn't until it was all over, that people found out that she had not only dislocated her right arm, but had also hurt her leg.
Only fat merchants except for a bit of scratch outside, the head is hit by a drowning, everything is normal.
If you replace the ordinary people, the wound is enough to make them go to bed for months.
Luckily, Liz is a full-time spiritualist, and healing is her guide, and under Liz's treatment, all three of the wounds have improved, but Rhode still needs a period of rehabilitation to be able to recover completely.
But it was a good news for him, to know that with his original wounds, combined with such a fierce fight, at least not to die and also to be disabled.
But now Rod's limbs are healthy, and besides the injuries that make the movement not flexible, everything is not the same as the ordinary, which is quite surprising, after all, since they rescued Rod, it's always been her to take care of Rod, so for his injury, Lizzy is very clear.
But she didn't even think that was Rod's body.
Not only did Leigh not think, in fact even Rod himself was darkly surprised, though he had already noticed in the fight that the body was probably not calculated by the attributes of man, but did not think that he could be so disfigured, be so severely injured, be so fiercely fought, and be thrown to the ground in a fierce collision, and be able to act...
You're not supposed to be savage?
But there was one thing that Rod didn't say, that he knew his own body because he knew his own body, though he didn't know what it was, anyway, he was not a pure man.
But the golden girl's performance is very strange, in the sense that she is a delicate girl, and a non-combat professional spirit, generally dead in this case, able to live and run because of the physical attribute of non-human,
So why would she be able to live and jump?
It's never gonna be luck.
This question wasted until Rod saw the gold that was hidden in the beautiful blue eyes of Lizzy--and it seemed that it was not only luck that made her live.
"This is...
Mr.
Maes rubbed her hands, and a clear smile appeared on her fat face.
What do you think we should do next?
After rescuing Meas, the three separated and searched again for the remains of the float, but found no survivors. In order to avoid turning the bodies of their companions into the food of the beasts of the forest, Lizette proposed that they be cremated. Measasas as he was grieving for the precious goods of himself, he had to finally change his mind, looking at the shadowy face of the blonde girl and the indifference of Rhodes, with a painful, dying expression, looking at a fire that burned the float into ashes--
That's like he's the most serious.
Although thermal ornaments purchased at great cost ensured his little life, but because of the excessive impact damage, now completely broken into a piece of broken copper and iron, thus, the loss of Mercy is indeed not small.
After a day of rest in the forest, although there was no trouble, after the attack of the wind snake, the fat businessman had become the bird of the bow, before he had sworn that the wind snake was nothing but a small probability event, now he has completely changed his mind, the old small probability rumors in the present fat businessman seems to be absolutely accurate!
You see, they say that way is going to meet the swarms of winds and snakes, and we've met them! And I've also heard that there are evil wolves in the Milky Way forest, and dreadful strange birds, and they're not going to meet us either!
That's what's been bitten by a snake for ten years.
When he thought of all this, the fat merchant's forehead was full of sweat, though he was good as a merchant, but he had no experience of adventure, now looking at the bushes and trees around the forest, the fat merchant's belly trembled, once heard his guard speak of the poisonous snakes of the wild grass, of the evil wolves, and now so vividly floating in the fat merchant's mind that he had become a kind of grass soldier.
Add your only life support has become corrupt, in this case, fat merchants have no choice but to rely on others.
He didn't have any idea of Leigh, who had taken a look at the girl before she was hired, and it was evident from her eyes that the girl was a good listener, but she had no idea, and she was not a fighter,
I'm afraid I won't be able to help myself once something really happened.
As a result, eventually, Meas decided to rely on Rod.
Although he himself would not have fought, the previous performance of Rod was very awake, which indicated that he had sufficient power, although he did not know how far the young man's experience of adventure was from that of the mercenaries, he should not have gone any further.
As for Liz, she seems to be still in the pain of losing her companion, and does not care about this.
Don't worry,Mr.
Looking at the fat merchant's nervous expression, Rod shook his head, though the other was more rude, but he did not hate the fat merchant, after all he said, if the fat merchant had not ordered the ship to be stopped, he was afraid he would not have been saved, so Rod had a little good feeling for him.
"I'm very familiar with this silver forest and it's not very likely that there will be any particular danger in the area where we are now.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
In the Milky Way, the most threatening is the Milky Way Wolf, but unlike the Wind Snake, the Milky Way Wolf mostly acts alone, so it is better to deal with.
And now after killing the Snake leader, Rod has gained a total of 3,000 points of experience, up to eight.
The Newer Zone is a tenth level, so as long as it's not a rare class of monsters, Rod asks himself whether he can walk in the area, unless he and the New New Whites go blind on the map and then break into some dead monster nests--but this possibility is essentially zero for Rod, who's known as the "Walk Library."
Just like that.
Hearing Rod's answer, Meas wasted his mouth, and took out his handkerchief and wiped off the sweats on his forehead.
Then, inadvertently, he had hardly slept since that day, because of his high spirits, and the sound of the wind blowing through the woods was regarded by him as a whisper of wolf, which showed how tense he was, and now that he was determined, he was much more of a stick, so that the fat merchant had no more to worry about,
Rather,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When the fat merchant was sure he had fallen asleep, Rod, who had sat quietly by the fire, stood up, and then turned and went into the depths of the forest.
CHAPTER VIII X X X X X X
Rod certainly didn't mean throwing the fat merchant, on the contrary, the reason he left was just to check his own profits.
In previous battles, Rhode gained a great deal of experience, but did not gain a great deal of advantage.
Although for the player, before the crashed float all the treasure, and there are so many dead people, the wealth is sure to be a lot.
But in the end Rod wasted the idea, anyway, the other side is a blessing to himself, now others died themselves to search for the things on them, but some too say not passed.
Though experience is precious, for Rod, what he feels earned is something else.
That's what he's got right now, and it's a black stone.
According to the Dragon, it is the core of the soul that has the power of a living creature when it collapses.
Its characteristics are rich, that it can be used as a stone embedded in a weapon, or that it can be made into a soul weapon after melting, and that it is also a very good material for making magical tools for practitioners.
Additionally, souls have a low probability of falling, so that their prices in the world of Dragons are always high, and for summoning swords they have an irreplaceable role.
Because this is the precious thing to wake up the spirit.
And now, when Rod stood in the depths of the dense forest, he lifted up his right hand, and he saw the core of the soul, as if it were the size of a nucleus, spreading a thick darkness. And now he was lying quietly in his heart, and all around him was a quiet, gentle jungle, and at midnight the moon passed through the leaves, and was shining in the earth and the bushes as a spot of light.
Afterwards, the summon array on Rod's back again shines, and the flowing magic light also quickly extends.
Then there was a system in front of Rod.
[Do you find the heart of the polluted soul?]
Purification.
Suddenly, on the back of Rod's right hand, there appeared once again the brightness of the white, as if the water had flowed through the fingers, wrapping the core of the soul at the center of the hand.
With the penetration of the divine power, the black mist that had encircled the core of the soul was melting rapidly, like the white snow that shined in the sun, without any trace, and with the disappearance of the black mist, the core of the original encircled spirit finally showed its original appearance--transparent, shining blue, as if shivering like an egg-like stone, as if it had felt something, trying hard to break.
[The core of the spirit is purified, is it awakened?]
"Wake up."
Following Rod's words, the shimmering blue eggs trembled more and more intensely, and then, with the slight sound of a "clap," the whole eggs broke instantaneously, and then, the blue paths, like waters, burst out, and they whirled at speed, and then turned into card shapes, and finally lay quietly in Rod's hands.
A cool feeling came from Rod's body, making him tremble uncomfortably, and at that moment Rod had already learned what the contract with himself was.
He picked up a card, a blue half circle on the right (representing the card's own attributes), and a V on the left.
As for the two lower corners, there are two small numbers - 2.
Rod turned the card, and soon, on the back, appeared a way of shining magic.
Flying soul bird (wind element): The flying system can fuse spirits, with a 10% chance of triggering paralysis effect, penetration effect, and no magic protection.

Good luck.
Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord
But the saddest thing about Rod was his attributes, and now his attributes of strength, body, intelligence, will, and so on, are still in the hidden state, which makes Rod a little uncomfortable.
Although it was his own body, now the state of the body that was expressed completely exceeded the normal standard that Rod himself should have.
He's already determined his attributes must be more than human, but it's a bad feeling not to be able to know his physical condition in detail.
You thought you were going to die, but you didn't.
It's a beautiful mistake.
But if you don't think you're going to die, it's a deadly nightmare.
Since he can't see, he can only guess from his own experience.
Through the previous battle with the Lord of the Winds, Rhode also had roughly some ideas.
After all, as a BOSS data, he has also been studied in detail.
From the previous battle, his strength should be similar to that of a standard right-handed swordsman, and his body is quite strong, at least after coming to the world, despite having experienced several crises, but Rod's body seems to have been tested, representing the lowest of the physical conditions is alertness, never reaching an emergency level.
In terms of speed, there is little difference from normal human.
But when it comes to the will, Rod has no way of testing-he can't always find a therapist to throw himself into the psyche and then see what level he can resist.
Just then, there was a slight sound in the trees, and Rod picked up his eyebrows, put down his right hand, and the glow of the summoning force on his back changed in the instant, and the card he was holding turned into a little magic dust, and disappeared in the instant.
After being sealed as a card and having confirmed a relationship with the holder, the sealed cards will no longer appear in the form of entities, and they will quietly sleep in the ring called "Ten Sources" on the back of the summoning swordsman's hand, waiting for the holder to wake them up to use them.
At this moment, two cards were sealed in the bottom of the outer six rings of the "Kingdom" - the attribute of "star trace" and the attribute of "spirit bird" respectively.
Rhode did not intend to expose himself too much to others, although the game introduced summoning swords as a player's exclusive occupation, which existed in ancient times far off the mainland, and the players were the only legacy of the occupation, they embarked on a journey to find and re-establish the glory of the once heroic occupation --
Of course, this is a joke in the introduction to the game, but in a more practical way, through the expressions of Liz and Meas, Rod can determine that these people at least do not know the existence of such a profession, so he is not comfortable to say more.
Moreover, maintaining a certain sense of mystery, is not to the advantage of itself.
And just as Rod turned, only to see Lizzy had gone out of the forest.
"What are you looking for me?
"Oh.
No, nothing, Mr. Rod.
Lily shook her head, but her face was a little uncomfortable.
I just want to ask how is your wound, there is nothing I can do...
At last, the girl's voice was getting smaller, her hands clutched tightly under her robe, and at this time, she, to the man a very fragile feeling.
In fact, Rod also noticed Liz's unusual behavior.
Meas was able to see her character, because he was a merchant, always going south and north, without any eyes had been sold.
Rod is able to see her character because of his experience as the first president of the board of directors of Dragons, to know that unlike reality, players are hidden behind characters on the network, and this is why their performances are more hidden than in reality.
In this kind of online world, it is necessary to concentrate collective power, after all, most players come to the game to experience happiness, not to make it a job.
You have to get them on time, you have to get them out on time, you have to get them out on time, you have to get them out on time, you have to get them out on time, you have to get them out on time, you have to get them out on time, you have to get them out on time.
So, how to observe the emotions and the inner thoughts of the companions around you, for such a council president, is obviously quite important.
Now, Liz's performance is very clear, she lacks reliance, which makes the girl very very anxious.
Moreover, as Rod saw, the loss of a companion was a great blow to her, not only because the person she knew had left her, but also because of anxiety and fear for the future.
In the previous battle, Rod looked at the girl, and at that time she was doing all right, she was able to deliver healing spells to her companions in the shortest time, and she was able to quickly expel toxins from them, and finally she was able to calculate Rod's guard shield accurately to the second, a power that can be calculated to be quite excellent for an auxiliary profession.
And at that time she was confident, the goal was clear, though faced with danger, but not hesitant and timid.
But now this trembling little girl, has completely lost the confidence before.
Chapter 9
Looking at the girl, Rod sigh.
The one who should be worried about this is you haven't had a good rest since last night.
When she heard the word last night, her body shrinked, as if she had remembered it again.
Nevertheless, the girl still stubbornly bit her lips, and then shook her head.
No No No No No No No No No No
Leigh's words weren't finished, so that's when Rod raised his hand, and a heavy claw went on her face.
What is he doing?!
Covering her red cheeks, Li, with her eyes open, astonished as she could not believe, looked at Rod before her.
The young man stared quietly at her, then spoke.
"I can understand what you are thinking now.
When she heard this quiet, almost without emotional fluctuations, a burst of anger burst out from the depths of her heart, she laid down her hands, clasped her fists, as if she were trying to refute Rod's irresponsible remarks, but Rod's next word, however, gave her a total loss of the strength to do so.
Just because you're different from the others, that's not exactly right for an angel mixed with blood.
When she heard this, she was stunned, and her conscious crossed her arms, and stepped back two or three steps, until she stopped when she hit the big tree behind her.
Even so, Lizzy still doesn't care.
She stared at the man, opened her mouth, but couldn't say anything.
How could he know? No, it's impossible.
He hadn't told him, but there were people in the Corps who knew about it.
"How did you..."
"Your eyes."
Rod put out a finger.
"Your eyes reflect the golden glow under the light, which is the mark of the angel of the "guarder of light."
But unlike pure angels, your eyes are not shining, and that is what your human lineage conceals-isn't it?
The girl did not speak.
Though not answered, Rod has confirmed his idea is not wrong.
This girl standing in front of him is indeed an angel mixed, in fact he has been observing Lizzy for some time, as a top player, in a long game career, Rod is already familiar with the means to judge the other's attributes by means of equipment, features.
This not only allows the most appropriate tactics to be developed in the shortest time possible in the BOSS battle, but also allows for the development of first-person tactics in the PVP battle.
This can be said to be a skill that all experienced players will inevitably master.
In fact, after Rod and Liz were rescued, he began to consciously observe the girl, and soon realized the true identity of the other.
Although it is only a mixture of blood, the angel's powerful healing power and ability to resist damage has not disappeared, which is the main reason why Lily can survive after being thrown out of the float.
Liz herself must have been aware of this, so that would have been so depressing.
That's why I said I could understand your thoughts.
Rhode shrugged.
"You know why you can live, but it's not luck, it's the result of differences between you and others, and you can't accept that.
If possible, you even wish you were just an ordinary man, facing death like your companion, rather than living so cunningly.
Lizzy lowered her head and held her skirt tightly.
But that's not what you can decide.
Looking at the slightly shivering shoulder, Rod's tone was much slower.
"You can't decide where you come from, and you can't stop it," he said.
Don't ever regret something you can't do.
"So..."
Liz finally opened her mouth.
What should I do?
It's your way, you should choose.
When she heard that, she paused for a moment, then she lifted her head.
"I understand, thank you, Mr. Rod."
Don't be rude.
But it hurts that one of your palms...
Although there was some "violence" in the process, finally Leigh escaped from the shadow of loss of companions and self-righteousness, and when the sun rose the next day, the blonde girl's face had no previous sadness at all, instead of the usual gentle smile.
It was a bit of a surprise for one to fall asleep without knowing exactly what had happened. He looked at this, and looked at that, and finally there was a deep laugh at Rod.
As to what this means, no one knows.
However, the fat merchant had not come to satisfy his curiosity, the word of Rod immediately put him into the abyss.
"I think it's time to go.
Get out?
It made him think that he was now not in his comfortable room, but in this hopeless dangerous forest.
They weren't out on the outskirts, that damn wind snake, and that damn captain...
It doesn't make any sense to say that.
Most importantly how do they get out of this damn forest?
Thinking about it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since the young man said he had a way, he must have made a very detailed plan, after all, they were in this deep mountain, and it was not impossible to go astray, and there were so many beasts hiding inside
How to avoid their capture?
These are the necessary knowledge to live in the field, you must be careful and not be able to leak half a word,
If it is due to neglect to die here, then it is too irreplaceable.
With that was the thought,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Let's go.
Wait, Mr. Rod!
The fat merchant almost jumped like a miso on a chair with an iron nail.
"Where are we going?
There's a small town in the northeast, and as soon as you get there, there's a lot more to go.
Isn't there something to be careful about?
It's not surprising that's what Rod would say, after all, as a newcomer to Dragon's Land, the Pafield area has already been dug up by the players, especially by the influence of online novels.
Early in the game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Of course, the reality is always cruel, although under the tireless efforts of the players, there are indeed found some very rare, attribute good equipment weapons, but unfortunately no one can achieve the player's "deity in hand, the world have" requirement.
After all, the standard is too high.
Though it was full of dangers and every step was likely to lead to death, for Rod, the area was familiar as if it were his back garden.
In the game, as the length of a session, Rod has no fewer than a group of newcomers to train here, so where are the more monsters, where are the fewer monsters, what task equipment is suitable for what profession, where are the attributes suitable for the most efficient training, etc
These things are natural for Rod, even if he throws them anywhere, he can go out with his eyes closed.
So there's naturally nothing special to remind him, and as for the Merchant's Protector's mission that Rod has done not a thousand and not a hundred times, how could he be mindful?
When he heard Rod's answer, a fat face washed away like a frosted egg, he had no idea of Rod's thoughts, but that was too uncomfortable, and when he thought about it, the fat merchant began to reflect on whether he had made the wrong choice, and thought about it, the young man had been seriously injured in the mountains, and if he hadn't been injured, it would have been so easy to say it.But now he had been injured, and if it had been so easy to say it...
Isn't it about death?
Even though there was some deep regret, there was no second way for Meas to ride under the tiger.
So helplessly, he only tightened his teeth, followed the two, and went to the depths of the forest.
Under the bright sun, the moon forest is very quiet, the sun through the leaves of the cracks, spreading spots of light on the ground.
The clear bird's sounded from time to time, and even the tracks of the rabbit could be seen in the grass. The sight was so peaceful that some of the already nervous fat merchants gradually relaxed.
It's not like before. It's anxious.
Rod was walking ahead, though it was not easy to walk through the woods without a way, but seeing his figure move through the woods with extraordinary flexibility, there was no way to stop him from doing so, either from the vines or from the stems of the plants with their hooks; he had been severely injured before it could be imagined, just looking at his back.
Immediately afterwards, Leigh was not slow, and it was evident that she had become accustomed to this kind of outdoor action and life, and though she wore an uncomfortable robe, Leigh was still steadily following Rod, occasionally sounding a warning to the merchants behind her to be careful of the road under her feet.
And the deeper into it, the deeper Lizzy's heart becomes surprised.
Although on the surface, Rod's direction is quite arbitrary, he does not choose a straight line, but occasionally bends to the left or to the right, and occasionally goes around a big circle, and if one looks at the surface, one only thinks that he is in a mess.
Few, however, noticed that, under Rod's guidance, in the forest, which was already full of obstacles, there appeared to them a flat road, as if it had been hidden in the forest, waiting for people to discover their common existence.
It's a very high skill, as Lee had heard the leader say, after all it's too difficult for ordinary people to find their way through the forest, and only the spirits who are in harmony with nature and the adventurers who are in the deep mountains on a regular basis can master it.
She'd seen her before.
At that time her team was lost in the forest, and sent to help their spirits did not follow the path already in the forest, but chose a completely opposite direction, at which time Lijee was very worried.
But eventually she got out of the woods quite smoothly, and that was the time when she learned the trick from her leader, but...
Looking at Rod's back, Lizzy looked at him with some suspicion.
According to the commander, such a skill can be mastered only by experienced spirits and adventurers. Ordinary spirits, though able to communicate with nature, have no way to achieve this step.
But the opposite is so easy, he never even stopped to communicate with the plants around, which means that he should not be a spirit, but.........
Even though Leigh had little to do with Leigh, she knew that Leigh's main weapon was the bow, but in contrast to Rod, who had never seen him since the beginning, Rod had never used a bow.
Who is he?
At this moment, in the depths of Lijee, more and more doubt.
Rod stopped.
Through the trees, he could clearly see the clear lake water, which was the center of the moon forest, the lake of moonlight.
In the game, this can be one of the camps for the players to rest in the middle.
That's great!
Looking at the clear water of the lake, Meas unconsciously licked some of the cracked lips, though it had not been too long since he had departed, it seemed as though it had been a few days for the businessman who had always been so respectful, to see such a good resting place in front of him, the fat businessman immediately stepped forward, planning to take a good rest by the lake.
But as soon as his body moved, Rod's hand pressed on the other's shoulder.
The fat merchant looked at the young man, but Rod didn't say anything, he just stretched out a finger, made a silent gesture, then pointed to the front.
The Fat Merchant looked at Rod's fingers with suspicion, and then his face suddenly turned pale.
Because just beneath the shadow of the lake, a white giant is lying there quietly, keeping an eye on God.
CHAPTER 10
As a businessman, of course, he could not have seen a wolf, but he could swear to God he had never seen a wolf of this size since he was born.
Just in terms of body, this big wolf is one foot tall, with thick fur shining, at this moment it is leisurely squinting, enjoying the warm sun after noon, the coarse tail is throwing away behind, looks very easy.
And at this very moment Li had her mouth shut, and she sat quietly behind Rod.
As a mercenary, of course, she knew how terrible and dangerous these beasts were, and though she had not been as nervous as the fat merchant to breathe, the girl, too, turned her eyes to Rod and waited for his order.
And Rod himself is thinking.
Silver Wolf Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna Luna
Beasts are ordinary creatures, and giants are monsters whose character is fierce and dangerous because they have lived for a long time, or have been stimulated by something.
(And when they wake up to their soul power, they will be upgraded to beasts.)
By that time, they were not only fighting on their own bodies, but also more difficult.
Even though the immediate Silver Wolf hadn't reached the height of its predecessor in terms of threat level, it wasn't difficult for Rod to get rid of it, but...
With this in mind, Rod looked around unconsciously.
If it were a game, then Rod would have no problem with killing each other to get some experience to get some material, but now it's not a game, and there are only three of them, and Lizzie's just a ghost, and she doesn't have the ability to defend herself.
As for Meas, out of combat, in this case, more is better than less.
With this in mind, Rod made a gesture, then turned to the other direction, after all, the lake of moonlight was not small, and there was no need to make special efforts to get closer to the road.
Seeing his moves, Liz and Meas looked at each other, and then followed after Rod to leave.
But unfortunately, the good fortune does not seem to take care of them.
"I can't."
Just as the fat merchant turned, his feet slipped violently, then fell heavily on the ground, crushing a branch underneath him.
Just then, seeing only Rod, who had been walking in the front, immediately turned his head and raised his right hand, soon, accompanied by a crisp bird, the green figure from his hand fired out, directly to the rear of the two.
"Bow!"
A low screamed from behind them, accompanied by the sound of the collision, and when Leigh and Meas turned their heads, they were surprised to find that the only black wolf that should have been a distance from them did not know when it had come behind them, and at this moment it was lying on the ground, and seemed to have been struck by some force.
Then a shadow flashed from the sides of the two.
As soon as the fat businessman fell, Rod had no idea, after all, in the forest of the moon, the sensitivity and sense of these giants could be placed in the first three.
Fortunately, Rod has encountered more than one situation outside of the pig-like NPC in the game, and these experiences have had an effect at this moment--
Although Rod's sensitivity is not high enough to locate these giants, he has made a decision based on his familiarity with the giants, and although the resting Moon is unlikely to attack the others immediately, it is absolutely aware of the presence of the others, with the characteristics of these giants, it is more likely to remain silent afterwards, waiting for the dark to attack again.
They waited, but they could not wait.
It's not much better to get active and to control the situation.
Rod's judgment is very correct.
The Moon did not think the other would attack so quickly, faced the flying soul bird, it made a subconscious response, but still slowed a line.
The blue spirit bird struck its body, and the burning shock wave struck it off heavily.
Just as the black wolf lay on the ground and had not yet come back from the shock, the flashing rod had already come to its side.
He stared at the big wolf, then stretched out his right hand.
The green bird flies back into his hands, becoming a card, and its color is instantly turned green into white.
Rhode did not look at much, he turned his hand, grasped the card in his hand, and went straight to the moon soul's right hind leg.
The white beam struck the moon's right leg and nailed it to the ground, and at this moment the snow-white sword appeared in Rod's hand.
The Silver Wolf raised his eyes, staring dead at the evil man, while trying to stand up, but at the same time as it stood up, but inadvertently shaken, had to stand up again.
By this time, Rod's second shot had come.
After finishing the action of the Silver Wolf, Rod also darkly dropped his mind, after all, the greatest characteristic of these elites is speed, and if it is not possible to eliminate this characteristic of them at the first time, then the next must be a struggle.
Now that silver wolf wasted a hind leg had no way of fighting as fast as it had just done, so it was much easier.
Though one of his hind legs had been removed, the Silver Wolf was not so pathetic that he stared deadly at the sight of the target, and at the same time as Rod's sword came straight, he raised his fore claws, and waved heavily at Rod.
Although the Silver had a counterattack, but had anticipated its action, Rod did not panic before the claws in front of him, on the contrary, he turned his right hand, the white swordsman crossed under the claws of the the Silver Silver and brought with him a flower of blood.
And just as the silver wolf ate the pain and took hold of his claws, he saw only the sharp blade in front of him, which was even brighter than the sun.
Attack!
The break of the flying blade pierced its huge body, light and easy to tear apart the original hard fur, accompanied by the painful cry, the black wolf flew into the air, crashed on a small tree, and then fell again on the ground.
Its half body had been torn apart by a blurred wound of blood and flesh, and it was possible to see the Morsenic white bones inside and the slowly flowing organs inside.
It's awful, and even Rod, who was going to get the last shot, frowns. After all, the damage to be done in the game is shown only in the form of data, and it's not such a clear scene, although it's been seen before in the fight with the Wind Snake, but it's never good to see it.
Assaulted by a soul bird, combined with Rod's highly targeted assault, the Black Wolf had reached the critical point, where the original threatening cry had now turned into a subtle mourning, and it was struggling to support the body and try to stand up again.
But Rod didn't give it a chance, but he took his sword down, and stabbed the star into his brain, decisively taking away his life.
It seemed long, but in fact it was only a few minutes, and for Leigh and Meas, what they saw was the silver wolf being knocked to the ground, and then Rod appeared beside it, and in a few short swords it ended its life.
This surprised both of them to know that was a big wolf, it wasn't so easy to deal with.
She asked herself whether it would be difficult to kill a giant so easily, even with the help of her own company.
But if you look at Rod's performance, where is it like killing a wolf? It's easy and it's no different than killing a chicken!
As for the fat merchant's mood is even more complicated, knowing that just when he fell, the heart was already a cold, he of course knew what it meant, and feared that wolf would notice their existence, but he guessed the process, but did not guess the end, although the silver wolf did notice them, but had not yet come to act on his appetite, tragedy became a corpse..
Even though the danger had been lifted, the fat merchant was still in the middle of seven or eight, looking at the young man who was not far from him, and he knew it was his own fault, what to do if the other man turned his face and threw him here?
He wouldn't have to worry about these things if he hadn't changed his routine. After all, all the guards around him were people he had paid for, and he wouldn't have to worry about being told anything if he had made any mistakes.
But now different, this young man is not a guard and a mercenary, he and his own relations are completely equal, if he is not tired completely can throw himself here to care.
By that time I'm done with eggs!
"This is...
I.
I'm not...
Thinking about this, the fat man felt a cold sweat on his back, he licked the dry lips, intended to say something, but could not say anything.
Just then he saw Rod stand up again, then turned and looked at him calmly.
"Be careful how you walk.
Then the fat businessman found himself doing nothing but nodding.
CHAPTER XI CHAPTER XI
Rudd originally intended to rest near Lake Moon for a moment to continue on the road, but after encountering the giant he had to change his mind, considering the bloody taste of the corpse could lead to more unnecessary trouble, Rudd finally chose a flater high place as a lodging when he went under the sun.
After finishing dinner, Rod once again assumed the post of guard, although it was harder for his body, considering that only he was most familiar with the surroundings of the Milky Way Forest, and that only he was capable of fighting, it was also impossible.
Although the fat merchant Meas had the courage to help, looking at his fat body, Rod and Leigh, although not much to say, but their eyes have completely revealed the attitude of the two.
So the tear-the fat merchants had nothing to do but sit by the side and rubbish up what they had rescued from the wreckage of the floating ship.
Of course, Liz was not free, and at this moment, she was kneeling by Rod, putting her hands on his left shoulder.
"Aliy Mia"
Along with the girl's clear singing, a pale white light emerged from her hands, then slowly wrapped over Rod's body.
In theology, nearly 70% of the magic has been passed down in the form of the dragon, which has been widely used by humans since the creation of the universe.
As for the remaining parts are composed of angels, spirits, demons, and ghosts, as a race originally created and guarded by the ancestors of the giant, they also inherited the magical gifts and long life.
And this is the dividing line on the mainland, whether in the kingdom of the night (the kingdom of the dark night), or the kingdom of the light (the kingdom of the light) and the kingdom of the law (the kingdom of the judgment), whatever the political system they adopt, the highest of them will inevitably inherit the spirits of the five giant dragons, and the second is the non-human dominated by angels, spirits, devils and spirits, and the next is the human.
Of course, due to the different political systems, the class composition of each country is not very close.
As a kingdom, the night kingdom's class system is relatively strict, and there is no human being among its superiors.
In a light country where parliamentary democracy is implemented, half of the senior members of parliament belong to humanity.
And the angels, the spirits, and the number of human beings within the law of the upper classes, each occupying a third, are fairly balanced, and this is because the law of the state, which is governed by religious concentration, believes in the way of balance, and for them, balance is the perfect choice.
Rod has his hands on this continent, and he knows what is going to happen, which makes him a little worried.
After all, the player can not play, can take off the helmet turn and go.
But now differently, he has become part of this continent, so, in the face of the next disaster, what shall he do?
"Mr.
Mr.
"What is it?"
Their voice awakened Rod from his thought, and he lifted his head, and looked at the girl in front of him.
Afterwards, Leigh had returned to her normal appearance, although there were occasional worries between her eyebrows, it had been much better than before, the seemingly end-of-the-world, which never seemed strange to commit suicide.
"That's it.
Liz, shaking her head, looked carefully at her face, as if she had been bitten by a snake, and her face, as if she had been bitten by a snake, and her face, as if she had been bitten by a snake, and her face, as if she had been bitten by a snake, and her face, as if she had been bitten by a snake.
"I felt something in the fight with the wind snake before.
"Oh?"
Hearing this, Rod raised his eyebrow.
"What?"
I felt some darkness from the Lord of the Winds.
Here, said Li, biting her lip.
"But it's very thin, and it doesn't look like there's any creature with dark attributes..."
Mr. Rod,the wind snake, shouldn't be the dark creature.
Of course not, wind snake belongs to the wind element, and the existence of the dark element is eight bars will not hit far, but.....
Are you sure?
"Yes, I'm sure."
Hearing the girl's confident answer, Rod was inadvertently into a thought.
He knew, of course, what had happened during this period of history, when a series of attacks on freighters on the roads of the winds caused considerable losses, and when the Pathans were investigated, they claimed to have been directed and operated by the nomadic peoples who lived on the southern borders of the disputed area under the rule of the Pathans, and shortly thereafter, the Pathans sent troops to attack the area, and to expel and kill the inhabitants thereof.
In response to this move, the Night Kingdom quickly responded, not only dispatching troops to attack the Kingdom of Light's garrison, retrieving the land they claimed to be their own, but also as a guide, launching a comprehensive invasion of the Kingdom of Light.
This is a period during which Rod and other players were busy familiarizing themselves with new environments, new systems, and upgrades, and there was not too much depth to this part of the background.
By the end of the game's official opening, when players flooded in large numbers, the Kingdom of Light and the Kingdom of Night had begun a full-scale war.
As to what happened, the players had their say.
Some consider it a tragedy that the Light State attempted to recapture its territory without doing so, while others consider it to be an intentional provocation by the Night State to wage war in order to achieve its expansion.
Many more people think that is the night kingdom has been looking at the light kingdom tiger for a long time, this time the light kingdom itself handles the wrong leakage – of course, the player has no position, all depends on his own personal preference.
Rhode believed there was some reason for this: the southern borders are rich in crystals, which are an important resource for any country, and there is no reason for any country to give up.
The Dark Dragon of this generation is indeed a very powerful ruler, until the middle of the war, even a player known as a cunning and unreliable rogue can hardly gain anything in his hands.
Even once it was rumored that was not an NPC, but that members of the game company were playing the role.
As for the last saying, after all, in the wartime the performance of the Light Kingdom parliament, apart from the pig-like teammates, is completely unspeakable, many brainless orders attracted the players complained, to the end even appeared a lot of battalion players actively counter water to the Night Kingdom to fight the Light Kingdom, thus can see the tragedy of the situation at the time.
But now it seems that second party conspiracy is closer to reality.
There's nothing wrong with Li. As a creature with light elements, angels are very sensitive to dark elements. She's half-breeded and shouldn't have gone there either.
Thus, is the attack of the Snakes on the trade of the winds indeed a precursor to the night kingdom's attempt to launch a full attack on the light kingdom?
It doesn't seem to be easy.
Don't tell anyone about this.
All right, Mr. Rod.
When she heard Rod's answer, she nodded, took her hands back, and examined Rod's wound carefully.
"Your wounds are much better, and if this goes on, you will be healed in about fifty-six days.
"Thank you.
Rod thanked the girl a little, then he lowered his head, and looked at the system information that appeared before him.
Part of his health is beginning to return to green, and if this goes on, it doesn't take too long, and he can move freely.
Now, in front of Rod, there's a lot more to do.
What's the first thing to do?
Rod frowned and fell into a thought.
At the same time, at the place where the float crashed, two shadows were slowly coming out of the forest.
Is this the ship you said?
' said the man at the front, wearing a white, flowing, beautiful helmet, engraved on it by glittering gold lines, which, if Rod were here, would have recognized as the mark of the officer for the defense of the borders of the Light.
The man who stood behind him was wrapped in a black cloak, and his appearance could not be seen, and in the face of the man's inquiry he answered with only a small head.
They killed my messenger.
The dusty sounded back in the forest under the night curtain, giving one a cold and chewing cold feeling.
"It seems like your pet is incapable of getting rid of such a filthy and incompetent man.
It's not your fault!
The voice of the black man suddenly became much higher.
"If you can find me a superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior superior
Are you kidding?
The man hummed.
"What do you think of us? We are solely responsible for providing resources, and your business must be done by yourself, and what do you do if we are able to do anything well?"
said the man, paused, and then relaxed.
How long will it take you to start again?
It'll take at least half a month. Do you think it's easy to find one that can control the wind?
We'll double your pay for ten days.
Hearing the other's displeasure, the man's face sank, then he reached into his arms, took out a purse and threw it away.
Ten days later, I want you to start again.
The purse fell onto the ground, and a heavy sound of metallic collision, and the black bucket bend down, and extended a dry hand to open the purse, and then immediately joined.
All right, ten days, I'll keep to the agreement.
"I hope you understand that's not going to happen to any third person.
"Of course I know.
All right, look at the ship, there seem to be three or two rats running, can I help them?
No.
The man waved.
"I have my own way.
Hearing his answer, the black cloak laughed coldly.
Well, I'll see what you can do.
A thick shadow appeared flat, wrapped in a black cloth, and then disappeared.
Looking at the place where he disappeared, the man's face revealed a clear sense of disgust.
One day even the bones will turn into ashes!
After a cold hum, the man turned, sweeping the forest around his eyes with a thoughtful expression, then he pressed one hand on the sword handle, and put another hand in his mouth, blowing a loud whistle.
Soon a vulture circled down from the sky and landed on the ground.
At the same time, three shadows appear from the depths of the forest.
The man looked at them, then turned onto the vulture.
Go find the three rats and get rid of them.
Then he gave a cold order.
CHAPTER XII
The shadows through the woods, they separate from each other, and then meet again.
Did you find it?
There are remnants to the east, which are very likely to be the target, and from the point of view of time, should be no more than one day.
"They're going really fast," he said. "Continue, be careful," he said. "They're going really fast," he said. "They're going really fast.
"Yes!"
After the three dark talks, once again, a dark shadow disappeared in the depths of the jungle, their movements silent, not even the birds on the trees.
And it was after the darkness had gone, that the blue and green bird stood still on the branches and spread his wings and flew to the sky.
"Are you tracking?"
When he heard the bird of the soul, Rhode's face washed a little.
At this moment, on his shoulders, the half-transparent blue-green soul bird stood there quietly, shaking his head from time to time, extending his wings, appearing to be no different from the ordinary bird.
Only that translucent body and the elements that surround it show that the bird in front of us is not a living character.
Calling the Spirit Birds is a way that Rhode invented while on the way, and usually players are equipped with theft or guerrilla type of scouts when a team goes on a mountain adventure, to ensure that there is no danger in front of the road.
But now Rod apparently doesn't have such a good condition, so he had to retreat and seek a second use of his summoned creatures to find the way.
Fortunately, the birds of the soul not only dominate in terms of distance, but also add to the soul element biological holdings of the sense of the soul, can also make Rod more relieved.
Originally on an insurance basis, Rod wanted to see if they had any trouble after killing the 10th-class giant before the soul bird went on a tour behind them, but unintentionally encountered a bigger problem.
Though the perceived spirit could not present the concrete form of the objective, it could only judge by the weak light of the spirit, but Rod felt a little strange from the speed of the other, able to pass through the forest so quickly as to be roughly the kind of adventurer, detective--
After all, it's an unspeakable occupation.
In addition to the other's actions quite order, it is difficult to imagine an ordinary adventurer.
Was it a coincidence?
Or is it special for them?
Rod didn't dare, and if the other was bright, it'd be better to find the door.
But this kind of hiding in the dark is the hardest to deal with.
Plus Liz's previous reminder made him think it was a little strange, and it was hard to imagine what would happen if these guys were hostile to them.
However, when Rod saw her beside her, she was unable to open her eyes.
He's got an idea.
"Where do we go next, Mr. Rod?"
She handed the kettle to the fat man, who was sitting next to her, with a red face, and a sweat on his face, she asked.
Although Rod hasn't said much, on the way to take care of the fat businessman the work has always been done by Lizzy.
According to the girl herself, her own company had taken over the protection of the gentleman, so that even if she was alone, as long as the task was not completed, it must continue to be carried out.
Meas was naturally grateful for this, but I am afraid that he will not be able to live any longer, as he is now breathing like a cow.

The fat merchant, who had fallen down as soon as Rod had stopped, holding his bag like a baby in his hand, took out his handkerchief, wiped off the sweats on his face, and brightened an oiled face, even shining like a big bulb in the sunlight
"Holy, holy soul, I...
I haven't been going for years Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co
It took a long time to get back to God.
Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go
Take five minutes.
Rod looked at the sky, then calculated in the depths of the next course and time, and gave the order.
Hearing his words, the fat merchant who was sitting on the ground screamed at once, and then lay down.
And Li, with a soft breath, sat on the stone beside her.
Since then they have not encountered any special danger, with the soul bird to take the way, Rod very smoothly with them to avoid many dangerous areas, though as a result have lost some opportunity to get precious equipment, but Rod is not heartache, because in the world there can be no more than cow-haired players, and ordinary adventurers can not move on the mountains into the forest,
So it's not too late to take the two out of the mountain.
But...
Rod looked up at the near mountains, and stood up.
"Lizzy."
"Yes, sir, what do you say?"
"I'll go ahead and see if you'll take Mr. Maes up the mountain after five minutes of rest. "Go there, and in the shadow, you'll find a deserted mountain path.
You're waiting for me. I'll be there soon.
Liz lifted her head, and, following the direction of Rod's fingers, soon found the white stone on the side of the hill, and she turned to look at Rod with suspicion, not knowing how he knew it.
But the girl opened her mouth, but did not ask, and after these days of travel, she had understood that the man before her was a worthy man, though she did not know what he was going to do, but the girl nodded, and then looked at Rod and turned away.
Rod, of course, had his own intention; that stone was the entrance to the Sierra, once a glorious business route, where the northern ancestors, with their poverty and their life's power, had dug out a passage through the mountains, connecting the plains with the rest of the region.
It was once a glorious place.
But with the development and use of the winds, the sky without obstacles was obviously more secure than the forests of the crisis, so that the trade route was gradually abandoned, and those who depended on its survival had already left here, before looking for a better life, abandoned their homes, until here again became a wasteland.
The progress of civilization always make the once miracle of no sense, put in any world is the same.
But Rod did not come here to learn the philosophy of life.
He stopped, and at this moment, in the sight of Rod, appeared a desert.
And the body.
Morzon's white bones were almost covered with dust, and only rotten fur and corroded weapons were scattered around the ground, and this was a mercenary called the Tooth.
They were attacked by thieves on their adventure, and then two defeated and wounded died here.
Originally in the game, Rod needs to first receive a mission from the commission, then follow the clues to investigate their final commission, then follow the marks on the map, then find here, and finally take back the letters and treasures.
But after all, it's a game, and it's a necessary step.
Even so, many old men would not have done so complicated, they would have preferred to take the letters by hand, and the same would have been the case when they returned directly to the service.
This not only saves time but also makes it easier to save so many troublesome steps.
But Rod's not here to save those steps.
Going into the depths of the field, Rod saw at once a white bone lying on the side of the mountain wall, wearing an already corroded armor, and a black, rusty sword falling from his hand.
That's what Rod is the commander of the mercenary.
Going to the body, Rod looked at it first, then stretched out his hand, and soon drew out from the other's body a commissioner's badge-it was the letter of the tiger's commission, and it was the necessary thing to complete the commission.
Rod put it carefully in his pocket, then he looked down, and soon found his goal.
It's a dirty ring on a finger.
Rod carefully took off the ring, which, on the surface, had no use, and was no different from the scrap of copper and iron in the garbage.
But the immediate system suggests that's not the case.
[black iron ring,,,,,,,,,,,,,]
"Common."
Rod closed his eyes, grabbed his right ring, and drank in a low voice, then injected into his soul power.
The ring of his hand trembled a little, and the original weakness of his magic was clear, and when he opened his eyes again, it was not the copper and iron that was in his hand.
On the contrary, a black, carved ring, lay quietly on his heart.
[will command,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,]
Let's go.
Rhode put the ring on his right finger, which was the only way to relax his breath, then looked down for a moment, determined that there was no more valuable thing, then turned around, and returned to the hillside.
There, Rod could clearly see Lejee and Meas moving hard toward the white stone.
Obviously the fat merchant had no experience of climbing mountains, and he followed her with trembling, looking at him like this, presumably not because of the differences between men and women, for he was afraid of crying early to take her with him.
It's a waste.
Rod shook his head and was about to come together with them, and at that moment, the alarm from the soul bird suddenly sounded deep in his heart.
"-"
With astonishment, he looked in the direction of the forest, and soon he saw three shadows flying out of it.
It's awful!
CHAPTER 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 21 22 23 23 23 24 25 26 27 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 46 47 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 54 55 56 56 57 57 58 58 59 59 59 60 61 62 62 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 64 69 69 69 70 70 70 80 80 81 82 82 83 83 83 84 84 84 85 86 86 87 83 83 84 84 84 85 86 86 87 83 84 84 84 85 86 86 87 87 87 88 86 86 87 87 88 89 89 89 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90
There were no more traces of the three, for the two who were climbing halfway up the mountain were no more than obvious targets, and they looked at each other, and flew quickly toward the direction where they were.
But Rod's not slow.
His body glided from the side of the hill, accompanied by a loud whistle, and the soul bird, who had once danced in the sky, seemed to have received some command, and flew down.
Faced with the sudden attack of the soul bird, the three black men did not panic, they quickly set up the counter-attack, one waving forward with his swords, and the other two kept the direction, and continued to the direction of Lizzy and Meas.
Obviously, they have a clear division of labor, and they are very professional.
Don't stopping for this little entanglement, if the other is really just an ordinary bird, really can't stop them.
But it's a pity that's not an entity.
Faced with cold swords, the green bird had no intention of evading, but directly caught up.
A gleamed into the black man's eyes, but at the next moment his expression turned to fear-because the black man saw clearly that the blue and green bird had passed through the sword and had come straight to him!
Elementary!
Astonished in his heart, he hastened to turn his body, to avoid the attack of the other, but even so, the soul bird passed through his shoulder, the black man only felt that his half body had lost consciousness in the instant falling into the ice kiln, and had been trying to keep balance in half the air, and fell heavily, even the sword of his hand flew out.
Neither of the other two went well, neither of them cared when the soul bird passed by.
But soon a cold wind followed, blowing through their bodies.
Both felt their bodies instantly become stiff, and had to stop.
Although the strangeness soon dissipated, because of the delay of the few seconds, Lizzy and Meas had already reached the place of the white stone.
When he saw it, the black man in the forehead frowned, he made a gesture, and then took the shortbow from his waist.
Hair, what's happened?
The paralyzed fat merchant, who had climbed to half the way, came to the side of the white stone, with his hand on the side of the stone, breathing with a great mouth, but before he had to complain again, a few dark shadows came from the side of the fat merchant, and shot at the side of the stone.
"Wow!"
Meas scrambled down with his head, and Lejee with her unconscious body shrinking, while she also remembered to take the fat merchant by the hand, pushing him into the shadow, to avoid another attack.
"We must be faster.
Just then, Rod, who followed, looked up at the three dark shadows not far from the mountain, and said.
"He, who are they! What has happened! Why are they attacking us?"
Probably the detective.
It was not too far, but because of the good weather, it made it possible for Rod to see what they were wearing, which were the standard suits of the spies, most of whom were the same in size as those who were under the guardianship of the Light Dragon, as to which country they came from, only after they had been killed.
However, Rod does not have this ability, and even the special ability of the spirit bird can only freeze them for seconds, and it is not because these people are too resistant to attacking the spirit elements, but because their own level is too low, that they cannot achieve better attacking effects.
It's worth it.
As to why attack us, I think you can ask yourself, whether they will be in a good mood before you die.
Though it was difficult for Rod to make a joke, the fat businessman could not make a joke, and as a businessman for many years, he of course knew that the spies were not the most attractive.
What would happen if it fell into their hands, the fat merchant, when he remembered the unpleasant rumors circulating among his companions, was pale and sweaty.So, though his tired thighs trembled, he stood up and followed Rod to the little road that was covered by white stones.
Thermal Road was once a very bright business road, wide enough to accommodate two carriages in a row.
But now it has been completely abandoned, and all kinds of rocks falling from both sides of the cliffs are piled up in the roads, which have turned the broad road into a rugged, and extremely narrow.
The three fell and fell forward, but did not dare to stop.
Rod turned to look, but the situation had not improved-the footsteps behind had become clearer and clearer, and had it not been for the constraints of the terrain here, I would have feared that he and others had already been surrounded.
"Mr. Rod! There is no way!"
Lejee's alarmed Rod, and indeed, the nearby road was completely blocked by rolls, and could not be crossed or penetrated.
That's what it is.
Rudd shook his head, thinking it was to force the player to the system's set course, but now it seems like it's not the same thing-
It's not what it's supposed to be.
Go to the right.
On the Right?
When they heard Rod's orders, they both stared at the little road to the right, but they did not hesitate for any more than a few minutes.
Even though the main road was blocked, there was a small road nearby, most strangely, it was clear, but there was a thick fog in that road, the sun through thick fog, which brought a strange atmosphere.
Looking at it makes you think there's something weird about it, and now Rod wants them to go in there?
Come on, come on.
However, under Rod's impulse, the two quickly entered the mist, soon, their figure was completely shielded from the thick fog, no trace.
When he saw the two entered, Rhode also relaxed, he looked back again, then stretched out his right hand.
"Cage!"
The card in the center of the hand turned blue, then the snow-white sword blade appeared again, after which Rod tightened the long sword, swung violently to the cliff.
The sharp blade of snow flew out of the sword, and struck the rocks above the cliffs, and soon, under the great noise, the broken rocks rolled down with the dust.
As the three black men pursued, Rod's figure had already disappeared from the depths of the fog, under the cover of smoke and stone.
"I'm dying!"
Looking at the trail of wolves, a black man bit his teeth complained.
The road ahead has been completely blocked by crushed stones.
Needless to say Rod's sword triggered a chain reaction, now that the cliffs on both sides of the road were shaking, it was more dangerous to go further.
What do you do?
There is no way.
Another black man stared deadly at the already closed mountain path.They only reported back to the captain and sent men to watch all the villages around them, and they were sure they wanted to get away from behind, but they didn't think of it.
"Elementary creatures, are there any wizards among them?"
"If they are, it is not surprising, but it seems to us that there are not any.
Just as the two black men exchanged views, the other one remained silent, looking at the marks on the mountain wall opened.
There is a very strong swordsman among them.
With that said, the black man turned his head.
"Let's go, these three goals are not easy, but we are not losing," he said. "Let's go and immediately monitor the surrounding villages, and I believe they can't stay in the mountains until they come out."
For Rod and others, the danger has not been lifted.
"Where is this?
The fat merchant stared at all, and he thought he had seen all the things he had been walking south and north for so many years, but the encounters of these days told him that there were more things in the world than he knew.
After passing through the thick fog, it appeared before all, a deserted, abandoned town, the whole town wrapped in thick fog, almost everything looked fuzzy.
Even if you look up at the sky, you can only see a gray piece.
The whole world seemed to be completely different.
It's awful.
Rod, who came from behind, answered.
"Just through here, we can get to the mountains of Alaska, and then we can leave."
But is there any danger here?
If you're not blind, nobody thinks this place is peaceful.
There is, of course.
Rod didn't make it clear that was the first copy of the game, and the first copy of the player, that it wasn't difficult to say, but it wasn't easy to say.
But it's awkward for the three in this line, after all Rod is only 8, and Lizzie is only 6, and the merchants with only 5 fighting powers aren't even counted, so it ends up that this is actually an 8 level summon swordsman and an auxiliary professional single brush 10 5 - put in the game will surely be regarded as a fool.
Rod wasn't a fool; in fact, he'd seen Liz before he'd thought about this venture, otherwise Rod wouldn't have chosen this path-
In fact, this road is now the safest, by comparison with the risk.
But as long as you obey my orders, there will be no great risk.
So..."
said he, turning his head, and looking at the blonde girl.
"I'll see you here, Liz."
CHAPTER 14 Theft of Two
Me?
When she heard Rod's words, she opened her eyes, and even her neighbor, Meas, opened her mouth.
As is well known, therapists, doctors, and nurses are the most common occupations of the therapists in the Dragon's Land. They are essentially auxiliary occupations within the team, wrapping wounds for others, healing wounds, releasing protective shields and removing toxins.
What about fighting on the front?
I'm afraid you've never heard of this!
"Yes," he said.
Rod nodded, and in the moment of coming here, he seemed to be again in the command of the team's brush.
"In a moment you will listen to my orders, which do not require any special skill, but your reaction and consciousness will be somewhat higher, but as long as you are familiar, I don't think it will be too difficult.
What do you know about energy now?
How many times can the Divine Light be used?
Despite her previous healing, Rhode roughly guessed her level, but at the risk, it was confirmed.
"I'm a regular spirit, and I'm on the seventh floor of the outer ring.
As for the sacred glory.
Only once a day can be maintained...if my soul power is not consumed.
In addition to the professional level, they also have the level of the soul power, respectively the outer ring, the middle ring, the inner ring, the outer ring ten layers, the middle ring seven layers, and the inner ring three layers.
This is because the practitioner believes that their powers come from the depths of their own souls, and in the common sense, the souls are regarded by the practitioner as three intertwined rings of existences, the deeper the practitioner explores his own soul, the stronger.
Liz's powers have reached the seventh sphere, which means that she is very likely to break the limits of the sphere's healers and enter the middle sphere.
It's hard for a six.
But then Rod would be more sure.
"Well, remember, from now on, you don't need to give me a healing light, even if I'm injured," he said. "Be careful, Mr. Maes, and give him a shield if there's any danger.
"This..."
I understand, Mr. Rod.
Although Rod had some words in her mouth that made her feel strange, she understood the other person's meaning even though she had guessed it, and she glanced at it.
"Mr. Meas, is our supplement still enough for a few days?"
It's still three four days.
With his travel bag, the fat merchant thought a thought, then answered, but with a little sadness on his face.
"If we save some food..."
It's a good time to lose weight.
If Rhode had a laugh, then Meas could have taken it as a joke. Unfortunately, Rhode's expression was very calm, without any laughter, which instead made the fat merchant more bound up.
While he wasting to say anything more, Rod had turned his head and ordered Leigh.
"Give me the glory."
"Yes," he said.
Faced with Rhode's orders, she lowered her head a little, then she stretched out her hands and closed her eyes.
Soon there was a gentle light from the middle of the girl's heart, a gentle white light spreading round and around, and I didn't know if it was a mistake, but the fat merchant found that the thick fog around him, which had been shining to this light, began to flee away quickly, and after rubbing his eyes, he found that the surroundings, which had been covered by thick fog, were now much clearer.
Some ruins could only see a vague shadow, but now they can clearly see the remains of walls and houses.
This makes everybody uncomfortable, after all, the view is clear that some are always more safe.
"I'll go first," Lejee, "Mr. Meas," "You'll come to the end," "Don't go too far from us," "No matter what happens, don't act alone."
There was silence in the ruins.
Brightness filled with positive energy dissipated the mist, but did not dissipate the danger inherent in it.
They moved slowly under Rod's guidance, stopped to watch around, and then moved on—but soon Rod moved his hands again, indicating that the two were stopping.
If his memory is correct, he is almost at the first wave of strange new.
It was unexpected that shortly after Rod stopped, a few faint spots appeared in the mist ahead, and they seemed to flash like eyes.
"Well, what is that?
Meas immediately became nervous.
It's a ghost.
Rod stretched out his right hand, and soon the mark appeared in his hand.
"Be careful, they won't get too close."
As soon as Rod's voice came down, the crowd saw the thick fog rise and fall, and then spit out three strange creatures.
They looked like humans, but all around them were packed with thick mist, three monsters standing together, invisible, even some not seeing their bounds, and only the three bright little eyes could confirm that this was not just a simple mist.
Perhaps not so easy.
"Lizzy," "the first light of healing."
Healing Light?
When she heard the command, there was a doubt in the girl's mind, that it was a healing technique, why should it be applied to this monster? But that doubt was only a glimmer in Leigh's mind, and soon Leigh lifted her right hand, and she applied healing light to the monster before her.
As a magician, Li's technology is still very good.
Healing Light is a medium healing technique, as long as it is possible to determine the location of the target, then it is not difficult to spread.
It's easy for Liz, but maybe because the other is not a companion, but a monster, makes the girl's movements a bit hesitant, but she still quickly completed the magic.
A white light instantly appeared from the air, then wrapped on the ghost.
According to the original effect, the life wrapped it will immediately restore a certain degree of injury, even can be revived, belongs to the foundation of the magic used by the spirits.
But the ghost's performance was completely different from the girl's, and as it was covered with that white glow, the ghost made a scream that she could hear clearly, and then his body, which had stood before, kept shaking as if it had been beaten with a heavy punch, and as if it had been wrapped in the mist, and even as if it had been dissolved in that moment, as if it had been melted by the sun.
This surprised Lizzy, and she even lowered her head to look at her hands, and couldn't understand how she could release a magic that was so deadly.
After seeing the ghost's performance, Rod was very vague, knowing that the positive energy generated by healing light was originally a ghost's negative energy set, not to mention that half of Li Ji's lineage was an angel's lineage, that the positive energy of the angel's lineage and the natural one of ordinary man's lineage differed in quality, that if the latter's released positive energy was boiling water for the ghost, then the former's accumulated positive energy would not be inferior to a high concentration of sulfuric acid, and fortunately Li Ji's was a mixture,
If she were a pure angel, then the ghost would have been extinct.
Liz does not understand why a healing spell can have such an effect, but in fact the players on the Dragon is basically clear, in their view, that the healing light is just wearing a mask, the essence of the spell is to put a positive energy. Just the positive energy brings healing effect when encountering life, to make it easier to see, does not mean that it can only heale wounds.
At the beginning of the Dragon Conquest, there was a joke among the players: The most tragic thing for a ghost magician is to meet a group of ghosts—because ghost magicians are essentially from negative energy, and use them to attack non-living creatures that are equally composed of negative energy will only have the effect of healing rather than destroying.
And that's why some of the ghost magicians who once had the fantasy of controlling the Death Army have to tear their eyes to learn some elemental magic to make sure they have the advantage over the non-death monsters -- yes, they sometimes have to be part-time nurses.
In essence, there is no great difference between the deceased and the spirit, and most of them live in a group environment where their abilities cannot harm them, and only when they encounter the opposite attributes can they have an effect.
It's just that's a relatively high chance of encountering life.
For the ghosts, it was not until the darkness came to the midst of the war, when the ghosts were raging, that they got rid of the garments of the logistics, and became a strongman in the front.
Until then, the ghosts are less likely to encounter the ghosts, plus the NPC after all doesn't know as much as the players, so it's not strange to stick to the rules.
But it's not the time to stick to the rules.
Two after the attack!
Rhode screamed to the ghost in front of him, while giving orders to Li.
"Yes!"
Perhaps inspired by the vision, the answer was also very spiritual, and soon, two more full rays of positive energy descended from the sky, falling on the other two ghosts, respectively.
The gentle light washed over them and stopped them from attempting to attack. And on this occasion, the shining Rod had already come before the first ghost.
The ghosts, brushed with right energy, screamed, and Rod was the target of their anger.
Soon, the ghost in front of him, stretched out his semi-transparent claws, and caught Rod with a call.
Although Li'e's power weakened their defenses, their attack power increased considerably, and if they were to take care of it, they were likely to sink into the ditch.
But for Rod of course would not allow such a thing to happen.
He made a mistake, and was able to avoid the long claws of the ghost, and then the sharp blade of his clean white sword struck straight forward.
Attack!
The Stars accurately hit the only semi-entity of the ghost's phantom body, which made the ghost, suffering under the brightness of the right energy, send out a cry, it desperately raised its claws, and then the body that was already on the brink of collapse completely disappeared into a pile of dust dissipated.
Just then, two more ghosts attacked.
Chapter 15
"Call..."
Looking at the dust, Rod wiped the sweat on his forehead, felt a bit tired.
All the way, the three encountered ghosts many, foot-five six.
It's not much if you put it in a team of five people, but now Rod has only one force, and there's no way of getting a MT up against it like a normal brush, and then everybody's out there.
Instead, he is able to attract each other with care, and then to release the right energy to weaken the defense of the other, then to shoot at the fastest speed.
Since the ghosts are at least ten-level elite monsters, even the weakened defenses of the immortals are equally difficult to deal with, and in order to pursue the maximum damage, Rod uses the attributes of the hand marks, and only tries to get the maximum damage from each sword to hit the enemy.
But man is not a machine, even in a game, such a demanding attack will consume a lot of energy, not to mention the body that Rod is using right now, in a game that fails can be repeated,
But if it fails here, then it is very likely that it will face death.
This pressure made Rod unable to even endure, and he lifted his head and looked at the ruins that were covered in the mist before him, and it was when he was certain that there would be no more monsters for a moment.
"Mr. Rod, would you like to take a break?"
Immediately afterwards, the girl looked at Rod, who, as a spirit, was not very aware of the meaning of Rod's every move, but was able to feel his current pressure.
"No... now..."
Rhode shook his head, though the little wonders had been cleared, but he had always felt a little danger, and he looked around with caution, but he could not understand where the little sense of crisis had come from, and from a distance they had not yet reached the BOSS plate, and should not have encountered too much danger, and Rhode was well acquainted with the non-living organisms here, and the monsters here should have been reasonably cleaned.
So where does this sense of danger come from?
Rod looked around again, but he didn't get anything, and at this moment the fat merchant next to him suddenly shouted.
"Oh!"
What happened?
Rod and Leigh turned their heads in a hurry, only to see a pale face, a hand tied to the travel bag, a slight shaking finger to the thick fog behind.
Just now there was a darkness...
"The Dark?"
Liz looked in the direction of her finger, but nothing in the thin fog except the light sun.
"No," he said.
"Lay down!"
And now, when Rod's mind was bright, he finally understood where the danger came from.
Then he shouted, and pressed on the girl's head, and forced her down.
"Come!"
Almost at the same time, a shadow flew from the air, and Rod could almost feel the cold claws brushed over his head, and even some stiff, stiff pain.
You're fucking dead!
At this moment, Rod's heart was sinking into the valley, and he knew what this dangerous premonition was!
It's a stone ghost!
Thermal Ruins once were a lively and bright town, but with the end of the business street gradually abandoned.
Then a magician came to save his beloved, and chose to study the law of death in this abandoned town.
However, the study failed and the philosopher died as a result.
But that method of death did not stop, and it produced a thick mist and so many immortals.
And the highest level of danger in the whole copy is the stone ghost that the magician left to guard his remains, that is the rare elite of the fifteenth level!
Rod would have been quite happy if he had replaced the team in the game.
Because rare elite are rare, sometimes the next few copies will not be able to kill one.
But now he feels cold in his heart, the other is a rare elite of fifteen, even flying monster.
There is also a considerable difference between those ghosts that do not rely on negative energy, and at least the positive energy of Lizzy can do nothing for it.
Additionally, the body made of black stone is exceptionally hard, and the damage that ordinary attack can cause is very limited, it can be predicted that this is absolutely a struggle!
In the game Rod down thirty times fog was not seen a stone ghost, so he subconsciously forgot this, but didn't expect to meet after coming here for the first time?
Is This Good Luck?
But now Rod is not in the mood to correct the problem because the danger is near.
There is no future in front battle, after all you are less than ten, challenging fifteen-level monsters is almost impossible to accomplish, even with the addition of stars, and the attack power is really limited.
Come on!
Without hesitation, Rod immediately gave the order, and with one hand he lifted her, and shouted.
Come with me, lower your head, don't look up!
Now to retreat is not possible, the only way is to find the center of the stone ghost's control and to destroy it completely, though to escape its range of attack is one of the choices, but look at his team configuration, and there really is no one who can easily pull the other out--if there were a giant or a thief.
But it's not the time to complain.
Led by Rod, Lejee and Mees lowered their heads and began to move forward, and the mist around them again began to rise, and it was evident that their movements attracted the attention of the ghosts, and already four or five ghosts had drilled out of the mist and began to move in the direction of the three.
"Lie, attack! Don't stop!"
"Yes!"
Although it was not easy for a girl to practise magic in the run, she had her right hand stretched out by biting her teeth, and soon, three or four lines of white light appeared from the sky, and fell on the ghost.
Then Rod struck, accompanied by a scream, soon the obstructors of the way disappeared into dust.
At this moment, Rod's eyes immediately flashed a system.
[Experience Points 1900]
But Rod had no time to care about the system's suggestion, so now more and more ghosts appear from all around, although their actions were somewhat hesitant and delayed under the illumination of the sacred light, but the advantage of quantity did make up for the gap.
Compared to the inflexible ghosts, the stone ghosts do not care about the sacred glory.
Although a product driven by negative energy, as a guardian of the wizards, the hardened appearance of the black shining stone made by the ghost is sufficient to resist the invasion of most sacred powers.
And after the first hit, it instantly recognized that the people were its target, and followed closely behind the three, awaiting the moment of launching the attack-it was indeed more difficult for a man-made organism to have some fighting intelligence than for an inanimate creature to be able to attack by instinct.
"Oh!"
Meas fell to the ground.
The stone ghost, who had been behind the people for a long time, flew down immediately, and two sharp claws struck the fat merchant who fell to the ground.
As Maes turned, what he saw was almost a shadow over his body.
"Oh, my God!"
Although the stone was fast, and Meas was well prepared to close his eyes and wait for death, his attack was not successful-a pale, shining golden screen appeared in the sky, blocking the sharp claws of the stonestone, and then a few snowy blades of light flew from the sky, hitting the stonestonestone upon it heavily, accompanied by a loud "clap," the unable stonestonestone fell out and heavily smashed into the ghosts.
And at this moment, Leigh, who had been halfway to the world, began to lie to the warm merchant, and to run forward.
Here!
Under the siege of the ghosts, it was not easy for Rod to get rid of most of the immortals, and then he lifted his head, and soon found his goal-that was an abandoned church, and that was the place where the witch used to test himself, and that, according to Rod's memory, the center of the stone-like ghost should be there.
But this is not a good place to go.
Just as Rod came to the door of the church, he felt a darkness in front of him, and he hastened to the rear, and then saw a dark stone like a ghost half-squated where he had just stood, and a hard claw had hit the ground heavily, crushing the original hard blue brick.
It's a life.
Rhode screamed, and as he flew away, he found that the stone statues that were used to decorate the church's doors on both sides were flying without wings.
And you can think about where they've gone.
Once I met two, it looks like I should have made some money today to buy the lottery.
Go inside and find the central control!
Rod looked at the stone ghost before he gave the orders to Lizzy and to Meas.
"These ghosts shouldn't go in for your trouble," I said. "I'll get these two guys," I said. "You'll go in right now, find the central control, then destroy it, and be careful of the trap."
"But...
You, Mr.
It's an order.
Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord
Go!
CHAPTER 16
The shadow of black crossed in the air, the storm emitted bright fire.
"Wow!"
Rhode retreated quickly, his pure white sword shaking unbearably, and a great shock came from his sword, shaking his upper half with some hidden pain.
As in Rod's memory, fifteen-stone ghosts really don't do well, especially two.
The only advantage is that these guys really have a bit of fighting intelligence, which wouldn't be a good thing to have on weekdays, but now the extra artificial intelligence makes their actions less threatening.
Especially the stone ghost who had a hard time eating a broken blade now screamed back as soon as he saw the white light shining on Rod's sword, and the other, though not hit, was hesitant to see his companion's action, which gave Rod a chance to breathe.
But it's only temporary.
Hold the stars, looking at the two stone like ghosts hanging in the sky, Rod bite the tooth.
Although the two stone ghosts weren't afraid to attack again because of their broken blades, Rod was also sure that they wouldn't have let themselves down so easily.
Although both sides are still able to - stand still, the situation will not last for too long.
When he was upgraded to 8, Rhode had his skill D upgraded to 4, although after the upgrade, the soul power consumed by the broken blade had been reduced somewhat, but if used frequently, there would have been problems.
Moreover, this was not the last battle, and Rod had to reserve some of his power to deal with the next possibly sudden event.
After all, he is the only one of the three who has the power to fight, and if all the power is consumed here, it will be very trouble.
Neither of the stone ghosts stared at Rod. Instead, they came back and attacked Rod with their claws extended, and left immediately when they found that he had a counter-attack.
This wheeled battle is quite demanding for strength, but it is not an obstacle for the two fully powered man-made alloys.
But it's different for Rod.
The sweat dropped slowly from Rod's forehead, his body becoming more and more exhausted in the last defence.
But Rod couldn't step back, knowing that with his present abilities it was virtually impossible to single out two stone ghosts, so he had only hope in Lizzy, after all there was nothing special to be guarded against in the church, but...
I seem to have forgotten to remind them of the protective force?
But after a thought, Rod shrugged his shoulders, and concentrated again on the stone-like ghost in sight.
You can't die anyway.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Meas fell to the ground, the whole man twitched.
"I'm going to die!
Oh! Oh!
Help!
It's just electricity! You're not dead, Mr. Meas.
While searching for the dust and spider webs covered the worn-out tables of the invisible that had been eroded by time, Lejee, who had never returned, handed a healing to Maes to heal his wounds, and then went into the search again.
Although ordinary priests use many protective techniques in their own rooms to protect their secrets, the church is after all "years of neglect", and with the passage of time, the strength of the protective faction is weakened by 78 per cent, and there is no particular threat.
As a semi-angel, Li's anti-magic powers are not too weak, so these have been weakened power defenses do not play much role for her, the traps that would have burst out fire and lightning at the time of the touch are in her hands only a few faint magic lights disappear.
It was the tragic Mr. Meas who, after all, as an ordinary man, had no resistance, which is why his performance made the defenses more or less threatened.
"Oh, this place is really disgusting... "
Meas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Within the darkness of the church, only the sacred light that was given to her quietly hanged by her, illuminating the world that was once dark.
But these scenes made Maes look frightened, and under that bright light he could clearly see the dark, strange, French, and the white bones of森 on the floor.
These were enough to soften her legs, not to mention the blood marks on the walls, and the frightened maid almost pulled her legs out at the moment she came in.
Had it not been for Lejee's very calm behaviour that made him very unable to face, and given the two more real dangers outside the door, I was afraid that the fat merchant had already escaped.
But now, he had to stick to his head and go with Leigh to look for the "control center" that he didn't know anything about.
It's such a mess. How can we find that strange thing?
Meas whispered, but looking at the serious look, he had nothing more to say, and continued to look for.
And now Rod is not easy either.
The Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone Stone
On the contrary, it turns, its coarse tail drops instantly!
Oh, shit!
Hearing the wind from behind, Rod was deep.
He turned hastily, and his long sword was immediately sealed before him.
Rod's reaction wasn't quick, but the attack wasn't slow either; he had just turned around, felt a huge impact pass through his sword, a powerful force that didn't just bend the white sword in Rod's hand, but shot him straight out, and stopped after a few laps of rolling on the ground.
"Wow!"
Rhode climbed up, and felt his head flared, his blood flared, and even half his body wasted, and he was afraid to throw away even his sword.
He was still trying to shake his head and regain his senses, but a small voice from behind made Rod nervous at once.
?
With that sounded like nothing, a cold breath came from behind Rod, and Rod thought nothing, and instinctively rolled, to avoid the attack of the other, and when he lifted his head, he found three ghosts slowly approaching him.
The stone-though the moment did not cause any damage to Rhode, it drove him from the church door to the edge of the boundary.
The ghosts had no way of approaching the church, though they did not disperse, but wandered around the invisible barrier, relying on their own instincts to wait for the opportunity.
And now the opportunity has come.
Rod, of course, did not intend to have all these ghosts, and in the face of the enemy, he had to bite his teeth, to give up the idea of preserving power, and the sword suddenly emitted a white light, flying forward.
A white blade came out of Rod's sword, and as it rolled away, it hit one of the ghosts heavily, ripping off his protection, and Rod did not hesitate to fly straight ahead, and his long sword drew a perfect arc in the air, and pierced the ghost's body core.
Just as the unfortunate ghost cried out to be dust, Rod had passed through its body and returned to the boundary protection.
What to do next?
Just as Rod thought about this, a line of system presented to him, but he was surprised.
[4000/1800,,,,,,]
You're already in grade 10, but you're only in grade 8 before you get into the mess.
Rod paused, then, to remember that he did seem to have swept through a system that had been sufficiently upgraded by experience, except that at that time he had encountered a stone-like attack, so he did not care.
And now it seems that experience of the ghosts he killed on his way is enough to raise himself to the next level.
It's not surprising, after all, it's a five-man copy, and almost all of the monster's experience is from one of Rod's, plus his level is already low, and the more he kills, the more rewards are added, so it's normal to get to ten--
Perhaps the only strange thing is that we live in the real world, but that there is an experience.
But now that doesn't matter, Rod quickly opens his attributes, and then makes a choice, knowing that this is probably his only chance of gaining an advantage.
[4000/1800,,,,,,]
[Experience Point 2 2000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,]
[Experience Point 200]
[Do you open the gift system?]
Open!
Without hesitation, Rod responded quickly, and in less than a second, three sets of different gift trees appeared before him.
In Dragon, each occupation after the tenth grade has three gift choices, they can choose one of them as their main, or they can choose the attributes and skills attached to other gifts to assist.
This attribute is also obtained by skill points.
This makes the player confused at first.
Because a person can get only one skill point per level, not to say the gift tree, including the skill of swords, magic, and so on requires a lot of skill points.
This also makes the skill points that the player can initially allocate fairly limited.
Fortunately, once players have entered the medium, they can use a "wake up scroll" and complete some difficult tasks to gain additional skill points to upgrade their skills.
Rod's summon swords also have three different talent routes: the summon master, the spirit messenger, and the hell lord.
Each level increases the number of spirits summoned by the holder.
And the "spirit" follows the path of strengthening the summon of spirit power.
As for the special powers possessed by the "Lord of Hell", the holder, after killing non-human creatures, has a certain probability of converting them to his own summoned spirits, of course, limited to the non-death attribute after conversion.
It can be said that the three talents are superior and inferior, that the summon master is dependent on the quantity to win, and that the spirit envoy is focused on the quality, but given the rarity of the devils and the expensive price of the core of the soul, that the master of hell is also a very good choice.
I'm afraid you'll have to hesitate to give up all of them, but for Rod it's not a problem, after all he's been in the sword-for seven years now, and all the knowledge and skills he's learned about the sword have long been regarded by a large number of players as a classic.
Even in the game, almost two-thirds of the players who choose to summon the Swordsman are based on the skills of Rod to create their own characters.
So, this is difficult for many new players, as soon as Rod saw the gift tree already decided the answer.

[ [ ]
Just as the last line of system text disappeared, Rod's eye corner flashed over a huge shadow.
But he did not retreat, nor was he afraid.
Rather, Rod raised his long sword and waved forward.
"Wow!"
A green figure flew out of the sword's flank, striking at the flying stone-like ghost.
The Bird of Soul.
Rod's biggest problem is he can't summon two summons simultaneously, and unfortunately, as his weapon, the mark belongs to one summon.
Unlike the common sword, the common sword is only equipped with a "normal" weapon.
Rod was an exception, although he had no intention of using a normal weapon, he was unable to give up the attribute of starring, and it was because of this attribute that Rod was able so easily to eliminate the levels and monsters that were close to him or even slightly higher, gaining so much experience in the early days.
On the other hand, this made it impossible for Rhode to take the kind of "attack with summons" that a summoned swordsman does, and he appeared to be more of a regular swordsman.
This made Rod quite uncomfortable, but there was no way.
If he wants to summon the bird of the soul, he will give up the mark of the star, but in this way Rod will be faced with an ironless situation, though the call is mainly, but don't forget the two words after it are the swordsman, not the magician,
So Rod can't do anything behind him like those healers.
But if you're going to use stars, you're going to have to seal the soul birds, and if you're fighting like an ordinary swordsman, it's no good for Rod.
Because summoning swords have one of their greatest weaknesses, which is their professional punishment - all sword skill-1.
In other words, the most skilled swordsman can be upgraded to SSS. But summon swordsman even more effort, can only SSS cap.
And at the beginning, the starting line is different.
All Beginning Skill Levels are D.
Rod's summons can only begin with E, which is the difference, can be said, in fact from the beginning of the world until now, Rod has played very hard.
I'm afraid he'd been a mess if he didn't have a handful of stars and an understanding of the Dragon's mainland.
Since he was already familiar with the state of summons around and around and fighting with himself, now this state feels very great pressure on him.
Now, with the "call master" talent, he finally feels the shoulder light.
Yes, summon swords do not have as strong individual attack capabilities as regular swords, but they are never single-gun sword fighters either.
Faced with the soul bird, the stone like a ghost, it felt the magical breath on the other, but the unremarkable artificial intelligence has no way to judge what is the thing thrown at itself, but it still recognizes the other as the enemy, a claw.
But this time, the stone ghost is empty.
As soon as he felt his claws hit the other, the solid form suddenly disappeared, as if a snowball had been struck, and instead a weak air flowed from between his claws and disappeared.
But before the stone had a reaction, Rod had quickly followed, and soon after he held the long sword and threw it forward.
A silver arc burst out of Rod's sword, flying toward the target of the open door.
This is the third skill of the Moon Sword.
Although, like the broken blade, it is a trick to attack with a condensed sword, but the effect of both is completely different--the shape of the broken blade is the shape of the light edge forward, although powerful, transmitting great power, but the range to be covered is too narrow, easy to escape.
But unlike the moon, the moon's curved attacks sweep across, and at least a large area in front of them can be a threat, even if it is difficult to escape.
Indeed, faced with the sword light, the stone ghost subconsciously wanted to fly the wings to hide from the attack of the other, but it was slower than a step, was swept by the silver and white light blade of the right wing, accompanied by the flight of a few small pieces of stone, the stone ghost originally floating in the air body also suddenly slope, lost balance.
But it wasn't over, because just as it was going to keep its balance, Rod had taken the first two steps, and then he had his left hand out to the next wave, making a strange gesture.
At this moment, the soul bird, which was originally made as a wind flickered past the stone ghost, the whirling wind again condensed its body, and accompanied by a crisp cry, the wind bird, which was wrapped by the wind, hit the stone ghost heavily behind, the strong wave of the outburst immediately blow the stone ghost away,
This made Ben scream his anger, but before he had expressed his anger, a shining blade appeared in the eyes of the stone.
One, Two, Three.

Rod finally regained the feeling he had when he was fighting, in fact if he had the normal weapon in his hand, he would be able to attack both summons simultaneously by opening the summon master,
Don't say two rare elites, even if BOSS is near he also holds the other alive and dead.
Unfortunately, there is no "if", and Rod does not currently have a second soul core that can be used to awaken the spirit.
So he had to give up the idea of winning the fight and turn and fly backwards.
Because just then the second stone like a ghost had fallen over.
Probably because of seeing his companions wounded, the stone-like-devil attack was quite fierce, but Rod, who had been able to summon the soul bird, naturally did not intend to be as foolish as it was hard to touch, faced the shadow that had already made him confused, and Rod did nothing but raise his head, and then blow a whistle.
Immediately there was a sudden wind from the side, which pushed away the darkness which had intended to attack Rhode, and caused him to stop, after having lost his head for seven or eight hours, before hitting the wall of the nearby church.
Rod certainly wouldn't have given such a good opportunity.
Under his command, the blue cyclone rose flat, the flying birds spread their wings, once again, to the enemy before them.
For a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The two stone ghosts that were once in the sky were now as if they were a drowning dog, and Rod, who had been under great pressure and support, was now immediately turning to sing and taking over the favourable position.
He consciously allowed the soul bird to cooperate with himself, forcing to separate the two stone-like ghosts, so that at any time they could maintain the "two-to-one" situation, and forcing one of them to come to the rescue in time.
Although the situation has changed for some time, Rod has no way to get any further combat, because his powers have already been exhausted most of the time, and although in the game, the player can be reborn "in full" after the upgrade,
But it's obviously not possible to give you such a good thing. So, although Rhode has ascended to the tenth level and opened the talent number, his soul power is only added on the original basis to the part that should have been upgraded.
Relying on these alone is no way to eliminate the two stone ghosts.
Moreover, while manipulating the two summons, Rhode's soul power is consumed more than before, and he has to pay more attention than before to avoid himself being "discharged".
After all, the level gap is too big, the stone ghost defense is not blown,
Before Rod's attacked only one of the wings, without causing any particular damage to the wings themselves. In this case, if Rod's firepower was full, it was indeed possible to destroy one of the stone ghosts.
But when all his power wasted, he had to face the other one alone without any iron - as a result of what anybody with a bit of brain could have imagined.
Now the only thing that Rod can do is to make sure that puts these two disgusting guys under control, and waits for that "control center" to be found by Lizzie and Meas.
Otherwise, the situation will change back to the same.
Although a wing wasted, the stone ghost did not lose the threat, it climbed on the ground, like a black stone giant, four claws flying, like a ghost running on the ground.
That's what's terrifying about these alchemy creatures, and if you think of them as monsters that only glow in the air, you're going to lose a lot.
Fortunately, Rod knows them very well.
Although he didn't think as a newcomer that just throwing a stone like a ghost from the sky would do them any good, this made Rod feel much less stressed, after all he didn't have to spend too much energy worrying about his head.
A dark figure appeared behind Rod, a stone like a ghost crying out his right claws to dig into Rod's back, but at the next moment, Rod flashed sideways, his hand white unwashed sword blade turned into a flash, able to resist the attack of the other.
Meanwhile, Rod stretched out his left hand, and the soul bird around him, after seeing his gesture, immediately sounded a flying wings, able to resist another stone-like ghost trying to attack him from the air.
Although it hasn't been able to do too much damage to this rare elite of the soul bird, as a pure elemental creature, only blocking is not particularly difficult for it.
With time passing by, Rod's heart became more and more anxious, and he felt that his body was a little tired, and even that his spirit was a little restless, a manifestation of the moment when the power of the soul was almost exhausted, and there was no movement in the church at this moment,
Haven't they found a control center?
"Come!"
There was a tremendous wind from Rod's side, which caused him to be shocked, and he consciously flashed to the side, trying to start the flash, but just as he was preparing to escape, there was a moment when the footsteps, and the skill that was supposed to start, lost its effect.
The Soul Power will soon be exhausted!
This made Rod sink in, but at this moment he could not think more, hastened to turn back and struck a sword past.
The hard stone claws with the white long sword.
The stone-the stone-the stone-the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone--the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-the stone-
Just then, suddenly, a sounded from behind him.
"Mr Rod! We Found!"
CHAPTER 18 The Heart
"Mr Rhode! We've found it!"
Hearing this voice, Rod looked back at once, and saw Meas, with a surprise, standing at the door of the church, with a beautiful little statue in his hand, engraved on it by a crouched stone ghost, with two eyes made of fragments of red stone casting a shadow of dark red.
That's the center!
As alchemy creatures, they of course know what the other holds, and soon, the two alchemy creatures immediately shifted their direction, and rushed past them.
"Wow!"
Seeing the two terrifying monsters running towards him, Meas screamed without any hesitation, he consciously wanted to turn and run, and at this moment, the voice of Rod had passed.
throw it away!
While looking at the two evil monsters, Meas had a perception that he would be completely torn apart in the next instant, he was still hard-headed and threw out the black, made into a fine sculpture.

Faced with the big present, the stone ghost was astonished, but it still unconsciously extended its claws, trying to hold the little statue.
But just as it was about to win, a breeze passed from beneath it, and the spirit bird, who had almost lost its form, carried through the air a series of semi-transparent fluctuations, and the hard-working snatched the statue.
This was the last of Rod's powers, and he had to take up his long sword, while his right hand went up and hit a finger.
Along with this sound, the soul bird beautiful in the air, and then flew over to Rod.
The two stone ghosts also stopped immediately in the middle of the way, and shifted again.
"Oh!"
Running on the ground like a ghost turns, the coarse-shaven tail abruptly flies, hits heavily on the soul bird, though it did not cause much damage, but wrapped, around the soul bird circle the blue wind element is slightly distorted, even with the bird's form is distorted.
The blue bird did not give up on the way, it still strived to beat the wings, flew fast from the ground, strived to fly to his master.
But it didn't reach its intended destination.
A giant stone claw descended from heaven, through the body of the blue bird, and the elements of the disturbed wind could no longer maintain the strength of the condensed body, instantly became the most primitive existence disappeared.
As a result, the black statue, which had been carried by the bird into the mouth, flew out, but soon, two dark figures followed from behind, and they extended their claws, opened their mouths, and stretched toward the statue before them--until it quietly and steadily fell into Rod's hands.
[the stone demon control center has been identified]
[Directive -]
"Aig!"Rod's voice was not great, or even low.
But the darkness that had attacked had changed now-some of the shining bodies had changed in the blink of an eye into darkness, the limbs stretched out in the air had stopped as if solid, and the strange red light that had burned on the stone like a ghost had disappeared in the instant.
Afterwards, two dark shadows brushed over Rod and hit him again and again on the ground behind him.
"Bow!"
Along with the sound of the collision, the lost power of the stone ghosts turned back to the original sculpture, they maintained the motion of just flying forward, now quietly lying on the ground not far behind Rod.
After losing their magical support, they were no longer as strong as they were before, and under the impact, the two stone like ghosts were inadvertently displaced.
From the original art sculpture became worthless garbage.
"Call..."
It wasn't until then that Rod was able to breathe.
At this moment he wasted, and the excess of soul power made his legs soft, and even holding the right finger of the statue could not breathe.
However, on the surface, Rod had a calm look, he stood silently on the ground, and after a moment put the statue into his pocket.
"Mr. Rod!"
At this point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Are you all right?
"I'm still fine.
Rod breathed deeply, and now he really wanted to sit down and take a rest, although in the game, the excess of soul power can have all kinds of manifestations, but really on his own he feels a little uncomfortable, but now he can't fall.
Fortunately, the shadows of the ghosts were no longer visible in the thick fog around them, and it seemed that they had finally made a choice to give up and move away from the forbidden land.
Although it doesn't mean they've given up, it's always a good thing now.
But Rod hasn't said much, and it's been his custom since he was commander, that a team commander has to stay calm at all times, so that he doesn't get overwhelmed by a small thing.
If you're screaming because of a little difficulty, or if you're excited to lose your enemy, then there's absolutely no positive effect on your team.
Now, although Rod is no longer the president of the club that controls tens of thousands of players, this habit is still affecting him.
But I have to say, seeing his coolness, let some nervous Leigh and Mees loose their mouths.
After all, they're always worried about what's out there, about what's going to happen.
Liz did her best to find the little statue in one of the corners, and she had to say that was her luck.
If it were a little later, the situation would be completely different.
Rod's original intention was to pass through the fog at the fastest speed, but the appearance of the two stone ghosts forced him to change his mind, after all the two stone ghosts almost exhausted his powers, and if he did not rest and recover, then the next fight would be more dangerous.
So Rod finally decided to rest in the church one night, and to continue the next day.
He's not worried about any surprises here. In the game's version, the church is also a place for many players to rest and organize their battles, so there's no big problem.
Though Maes looked at the black church and the horrifying decorations, it was a pity, as always.
He had no say in any way against Rod's decision.
The sky was getting darker.
A thick fog wandered outside the church, and looked through the window, and saw nothing but a blank.
The three were sitting in the center of the church, which had been abandoned, and the rotten prayer chairs and tables were made of wood, playing the last bit of heat in the burning pile,
The cold wind from the cracks of the broken windows and walls, with the coldness of silk.
Leigh carefully extended her hand, took off her left chest bandage, and then her beautiful eye frowned a little.
It broke again, Mr. Rod.
"I know."
Rod nodded and said nothing.
It wasn't actually the first, after all, it was Rod who was at the front of the battle, and although he had avoided using his left hand in the light of his chest injury, he hadn't taken that much into account when he had encountered some particularly unpleasant trouble,
And this leads to his wounds from time to time, which, according to Leigh, would have been better if he had kept quiet for two or three days,
You can't reply for a dozen days.
But the girls had no way of complaining because it was after all for them, So the only thing that Lily could do was to help Rod change a clean bandage every day to avoid infection,
Fortunately she had little to carry as a spirit before she left the floating ship.
After removing the bandage, the wounds in the light of the fire allowed all to breathe in the cold of their mouths, and Meas even felt his chest with palpitations, and looked at Rod's chest with some fear.
There was a thin black claw on the three legs now that Rod's chest was full of bloody black scars, many of which had been torn apart before the fierce battle with the stone-like ghosts, red blood leaking out of them, mixed with those already black blood clots, it seemed to be a cold in the heart.
Liz took out her handker, poured water from the kettle, then pressed on Rod's chest, which made the latter's body instinctively convulsive, and even Maes showed an impatient look, turned straight and did not want to see again.
"Yes, I'm sorry, but does it hurt?"
It's all right.
Faced Li Ji's panic inquiry, Rod shook his head,
Although there is some pain, it has not yet reached the unbearable level.
When she heard Rod's answer, she let go of her mouth and continued to wipe Rod's wounds, and at the same time, the girl began to sneak at the young man who was slightly larger than herself.
Frankly, when we first met, Rod had a very common impression on Leigh, for he was very tall and very white, and Leigh thought of him as a kind of noble.
However, because Rod's attitude was not as loud as those of the nobility that she had seen, she was able to accept, but at that time she did not look too heavy on the other, after all, a man who looked like a woman, and the first impression of a man was largely weak.
But afterwards, Li's opinion changed slowly.
Unlike the nobles, the young man possessed considerable power, not even inferior to his leader, and his character was very steady, accompanied by him would be very relieved, even in the face of danger, would not panic.
And unlike his appearance, this is a very strong man.
Liz knew how painful the wound was and she had treated many as a healer, and many of the warriors who did not wrinkle their faces in the treatment of the wounds were screaming and screaming,
But Rod had noise from the beginning to the end, not to mention he was standing in front of the battle with such heavy wounds...
Liz's hand stopped.
What are you thinking?
It's awful.
The girl shook her head, threw those strange thoughts into her head, and then she continued her work.
Rod did not notice the strangeness of the girl around him, and at this moment his attention was concentrated on his right hand, in the center of his palm, lying two scattered jewelry of dark red colour.
That was one of the war's gains, the heart of a stone-like ghost.
Chapter 19 Upgrade
As a careful guardian, Stone is said to be the most beloved of all the wizards, but since they are wizards, most of them choose to do their best, although as guardians, Stone Stone is a good thing, but it is a great waste to use it as a bodyguard, so for many wizards, Stone Stone can be used not only as a guard, but also as an insurance box.
These two stones are like ghosts.
In their fragments, Rod found many good things, as the rare elite of the fifteenth level, the "fall" of the stone-like ghosts is really true to their rare elite status, besides the gems, crystals and some gold coins, Rod also found three magical items in them.
Cold Shields [Eletic]: When attacked, can automatically trigger cold shields, resist 50 to 150 damage, immune water attribute attack.
Oath Keeper: Holder can increase +5 magic effect. +5 magic resistance.
Magical Rules: A "magic" can be activated every ten natural days for half an hour
They're all very good fortunes if they're sold to auction.
But unfortunately, they are the equipment of the practitioner.
Eventually, these items were given to Leigh, as a spirit, although not an attacker, but as an advantage to her, so that Rod gave her the ice guard and the oath guard, and left himself with the mist command.
In the game, the skill of the ring was quite helpful to the self-brushing person, so Rod was uncomfortable to leave it.
It was a surprise and astonishment for Leigh that she had nothing to do with the two supplies, which in general, although they had received a lot of magical supplies when they ventured out, were usually sold to the commander, who then had the money to keep the whole company running,
It's hard to imagine giving it directly to others.
This also shows the difference between the NPC and the player.
As a part of the world, the ultimate goal of the mercenaries is only to make a living, so even if they find rare equipment, most of them will not stay.
As a matter of fact, many small crews rarely take on tasks that are too difficult, and they even do lifelong trilogy tasks that don't work well for the players, because the aim of these crews is to make a living, and that's all.
Those who are qualified to receive magical equipment, are usually high-minded, high-powered persons in the commission.
What about the unpowered mercenaries? Just watch their mouths water.
But unlike the players,their goal from the beginning of the world is better, higher, stronger, better equipment, more experience, higher reputation, stronger characters, that's what the players are pursuing.
So for them magical equipment is not a rare commodity, and for the players they don't worry about getting stuck in their hands -- they'll sell it as soon as they find a better one.
It's like the three spells in front of you, and in Rod's eyes it's a 10 to 15 level transition, and then it doesn't make any sense, and while the cold spells are good, Rod doesn't need them,
If he is able to have a water element high summon spirit, then he can also get the effect of an immune water attribute attack, so distributing this "low-end" equipment is not much for him.
Unless a legend such as the Sword of Heaven or the Heart of the Holy, a false legend or ancient-class object, he will consider it.
But it seemed to me that equipment was very high, and that even the commander of a medium-sized mercenary had only thirty-five pieces of magical equipment, and the magicians had more.
However, as ancillary profession, it is difficult to acquire equipment.
Moreover, in terms of their position and nature, they are generally not required.
And now, as a spirit of a small mercenary, she's got two good spells in a blink?
It even makes Liz question whether she is dreaming.
Meas, on the other side, however, saw more from it than from Liz.
As a merchant, of course, Meas was able to understand how precious a magical device was, especially those that, in Meas's opinion, were worth twenty-three thousand dollars even if they were sold at the North's most prosperous harbour, Karag.
But Rhode gave them, calm as if they were a piece of bread rather than a piece of equipment, which was not the kind of calm that a young man puts on in order to be cool in front of a beautiful girl,
It's a calm-that is, Rod really didn't look at these magical devices.
This is certainly not what the common man can do. Meas and many others, among whom are the mercenaries and the nobles, but for them these magical devices are also quite expensive.
Very rarely do people throw away with their hands, and they don't look like Rod, like they don't look at the equipment at all.
What does that mean?
This means in the eyes of this young man, that this magical equipment is not worth at all.
And it's clear that young man is very likely to come from somewhere else.
If Meas had previously only regarded Rhode as an ordinary member of the countless nobles of the continent, he had now begun to relate the young man to the great nobles or to the royalty of ancient times, and to the families that possessed the many magical devices, and to the families that regarded them so lightly--as if a man who possessed countless riches did not care for the loss of a small amount of money, though it might be to the common man that they could not earn in a lifetime of extreme poverty.
This thought made the fat merchant uncomfortable at times. As a small merchant, he had little chance of meeting with the nobles of the world who had a long history. After all, the nobles had great helpers, and a small merchant like him could not be seen.
And now that opportunity, if he can grasp well, say, there will be no hope.
But that thought washed away, thinking of himself as a pig, though the young man hadn't complained too much, but the fat businessman himself knew-that he hadn't shown himself to be worthy of the attention of the other, which made him feel uncomfortable again.
Rod didn't really care about the three; in fact, what he cared about most was the two heart-shaped stones in his hand.
Their Hearts.
The Human Spirit.
This seems a little complicated, but if you're a player, if you're a robot, then the stone ghost's heart is the chip.
Value is not a word.
In the dragon's mainland, alchemical creatures are very high-tech, creation of life is the patent of God, even the philosopher can not contradict this, and the artificial soul is the one they push and seek the next helpless choice.
For this reason, the complete human soul core is very rare, and not every magician can learn.
But fortune tellers, having a gold creature is one of their highest goals-as if a wealthy man had to have a racing car to prove his worth.
This kind of physicist usually looks very close, there is very little circulation in the market, there is very little production, the natural price is very high.
With normal auctions, tens of thousands of gold won't run out, and if it were on the black market, it would be higher, divided by color, and the best synthetic soul core could even be sold by millions, which would be enough to buy a tiny piece of territory.
Besides, therapists are very rich.
But Rod doesn't care about the money, years of player experience tells him a reason, money can be earned at any time, and how much money is earned is not enough.
But there are things that money can't buy.
For example, another ability of the stone-like spirit.
Force Force Force Force Force Force Force Force.
Their experience is shared with the holder, and generally, if Rhode gains 1,000, he actually gains only 700, and the remaining 300 are gained by the spirits in the battle.
Although this third of the experience does not seem to be too much, it accumulates more and more, and this is why summoning the swordsman is more difficult to climb the peak than other professions.
In fact, according to the rules of the game, if Rhode was a different occupation, then he had an experience of eating a replica of a ten-level five, up to now at least should have been twelve-level, but due to the sharing of blue birds and stars, until then Rhode had just started ten-level.
As for his calls...
[Eternal Sword,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LV:5,,,,,,,
Levels of summoning spirits are 10, and after 10 there is an opportunity for evolution.
After evolution, they not only change, but the upper level will increase again to ten levels, until the third evolution.
Their ability is to force up one level of summoning spirits to the tenth level, and then to initiate evolution.
This not only leaves more experience, but also reduces the time to practice.
What is not paid for?
Time is money.
Rod doesn't know what the level limit is, but according to his experience, the summon card level at the end of the set is usually not too high, and the three-dead evolution is the limit.
If the two stones in your hands were to be smashed into the heart of the ghost, then at least when fighting with the same level monsters, the enforced upgrade of the class sword would not go to rob Rod's experience.
But...
Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord
Rod didn't go, but now he feels a little strange.
Only this one?
How did the previous system tell him that he had only one tenth of the permanent card, and turned into this one?
So what about the remaining nine?
And this is the tenth, the last one, and it should have nine cards in front of it.
However, there is no card set in the game, because it is only a real souvenir, in the background of the game, Rod has not heard any information about the Sword set.
It is also unlikely to be hidden in the game, because the card was born after he won the competition, and because he founded a society called Starlight, the company specially designed such a card for him as a prize and as a souvenir.
This kind of temporary work is impossible to get into the game system.
But anyway, try.
Thinking about it, Rod reached out his right hand and held one of the stones to his heart, and soon a system of hints appeared before him.
Explore the Heart (magic), is it used?
Use.
Rod gave an answer.
Along with Rod's answer, the summon array that appeared on his right hand, instantly flashed out the likeness of the absence of magic, then, the dark red gem broke under the light, transformed into powder disappeared.
Suddenly, new information appeared before Rod again.
Goal
Star.
Rod looked down and answered.
Objective - - - - - - -
[grade upgrade complete]
Are You Evolving?
Yeah.
The blank card once again appeared in Rod's hands, and the glow that it spread out left neither Leigh nor Mees wondering.
At this moment, a system suggestion was also emerging from Rod's eyes.
[Evolution Ends]

That's good!
Seeing this system's suggestion, Rod nodded with satisfaction, that the marks had three special skills, which were all attached to the weapon, that is to say, that the release of these skills did not consume Rod's spirit power.
And the number of the use three every natural day is also calculated to be superior, can imagine, in the fight must play a great role.
But the next system suggested, but Rod did not give a slight.
[detects magic]
CHAPTER VII
It's what Song and others wanted to ask, was taken out first, you look at me, I look at you, all don't know what's going on, where the answer comes out.
Yu immediately flew to the place that made a huge sound, Yan Shu three immediately follow.
Song and others looked at a glance, also followed up to see exactly.
When they came to the door of the mountain, they saw the moon, and the three-letter stone engraving had broken a place, and all the people were astonished that there had been a man who had destroyed the mountain door of the east entrance.
He turned back, looked at Song and others, and laughed more than: "Well! I just arrived today, and it seems that there are people waiting to give me a ride! Well!
Song and others were in astonishment, they understood in the words of the other, but this is absolutely not done by them, because they were just sitting around together a little gathering, and are discussing how to look at the future to Miaoyi, and heard the unusual noise before running out.
Several people have doubted whether they did it, see it like this, and think that it is not necessary to break his own mountain gate to look at the color, after all, that苗毅 is the owner of Donglai-dong, has just been appointed by people to break the sign is a disgraceful thing.
This must be said clearly, or once stabbed into bearing this responsibility, Song holds up his fist, "The cave master, this is not what I will do!
Several others followed, seemingly for the first time in eight years to treat Miao as the master of the cave.
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
He is not here, and now it is not good to say that I am not going to put you in the eyes of the cave master, so he is not here, only to hold the fists 'True' replied: 'The cave master has just come and may not know the situation, the east came to the city has not been sent, I wait for the meals are all handled by myself, for the sake of the belly, the subordinate leaves for a while, did not think it happened such a thing.
Prince Fa and others hold the fist to prove: "The master of the cave, I wait to prove, the brother of Song is just eating with us.
Miao said with a loud voice, Is it you who fell down? Don't tell me it was blown down by the wind!
Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song
Seong's eyes flickered uncertainly across the crowd and said in a tone of darkness, "Is there anyone who comes to me east to get into trouble?"
Everyone was astonished that was possible and looked around quickly.
"What are you waiting for here? Don't you want to get your neck washed out in your sleep?
"Yes," said the three men, holding their fists down, and hurrying around the forest.
"Well," said Mia, "I'm not going to look for you," "I'm not going to look for you," he said.
At this time how to show that is not related to himself and others, Song Shu immediately turned around, drinking: Don't follow the order of the cave master to search!
Their hands were stretched out at once.
However, Song was called by Sung Yi, "Song Song, you come with me!
Therm, therm, therm, therm, and therm.
As soon as they left, a shadow like the shadow of the water appeared on the ground, not the others, but the old white shadow of the age of fashion.
Looking at the fallen stone gate, he shook his head and smiled, "The world is like a chess, a hot-blooded man is only a pity! I have always been worried that your little man is too good in nature, easy to lose.
At the end, the whole man's shadow wandered like a wave, and disappeared silently in the wander.
In the east of the torch shaking, Song stood behind Seung Yi one by one in the hall, outside the black charcoal has stood up, seems to have noticed what sneezed.
He stared at his throne with a blank face, leaned back at Song, and did not speak.
The atmosphere between the two a bit depressed, Song waited for a moment, at last he could not help asking,What does the master call me?
"You know what's wrong with you," he said.
With a grinning, he glanced at the dining table, and said softly, This is not what I'm doing, what is wrong with Song?
That's not what I'm asking! Turned around, stared at him, and asked coldly one word at a time, "I'm ordering you to guard the mountain gates, why do you stay away from the guard? Why don't you keep my cave master's orders in your eyes!"
Song thought, What do you think?
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
"Do you think that when I report the matter, the lords and the lords of the mountains will believe your explanation?"
Song said with a smile: "Your mouth has two skins, so please don't blame Song, but don't forget that someone has a mouth to argue, not a dumb."
"It looks like you don't have to repent!"
As soon as this was said, Yan, Uniformity, and the Cheu Shao group appeared together outside the door, and went in to hold Qian Yu: "The master of the cave, for the time being, did not find any suspect."
"The suspect is in sight, why not find a word! "
Simplification and the Cheu Shao group seem to have received the encryption, quickly flashing to shut the door.
Sung,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Song quickly pulled out with him sword, a cold light out of the sheath, quickly dozen as a buckle against.
Single and the Cheu Shao group almost instantly shot out, joined hands surrounded Song.
Yan and Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song
Shameless robber!
Being surrounded and unable to escape, Kan waved his sword and Yan Shu was struggling to be together with Song's grieving cry, and before he had finished, was hit hard by the two guns coming hard by the defense of the force, hit hard into the chest.
Song shook his eyes trying to look back at Seung Yi, shaking lips, the anger in his eyes can not be described.
He finally realized that was a conspiracy, that the collapse of the mountain gate was not only to plunder him, but also to leave his own gate, to prevent him from rebelling against it, and the main purpose was his own life.
CHAPTER VII
Don't kill now!
Yan raised his sword, and without hesitation, dropped one of his axes, and cut off his head.
Single and the Cheu Shao group also pulled guns from Song's arm.
The three still jumped, and immediately looked at the young.
He did not intervene, but did his best to protect a table of wine from being attacked by several men.
At this moment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The three arched hands and fled quickly to the palace, disappeared.
It was at this time that苗 went to the gate, opened the gate, crossed the threshold, reached out and touched the black coal mantle, looked out at the moon.
His eyes were cold, and in his mind the picture was of himself with one hand, with the other with the third hand, in the face of a group of adults who deceived the door, he was helpless in his grief, a knife was placed on his thigh, blood was pouring...
Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother Brother
S S S S S S
His black and green beads flashed a weak light.
Black Charcoal shook his head and sneaked...
Their fighting and Song's cry before he died drew him back to the same door.
Prince Fao and Zhu Tian-the three masters of the white flower-the merchants came again, the侯胜, the king Xuechen, and the southern thinkers came again.-the Yan Shu, the Single-minded and the Chu Shao group finally arrived, and seemed to have heard the silence.
A group of people who wanted to enter the hall to see what, but were blocked by the cross-shooting of the horses outside the hall.
He rides across the dragon, holds the silver gun, is at the end of the stairs at the gate of the great hall, sits high and looks down at the people.
Outside the hall the darkness, the moon shining.
Within the hall, behind, the torch of the bright hall, the visual error between light and darkness makes it a little difficult to see the appearance of Miaoyi, added some mystery and some dignity, at the same time can feel from Miaoyi's killing breath.
Look at me, I look at you, and finally the Prince asked the archman, "Lord of the cave, we just seem to have heard the fighting, and the cry of the brother of the Song, dare to ask the brother of the Song can be in the palace!"
"Yes, but I'm already in a different place!" Mia did nothing to hide. She lifted her hand to the side of her leg, and put on someone's hair, and a head came out of her hand.
Astonished, the consciousness retreated, only to see a large good head rolling by the feet of the people stopped.
Their eyes widened and they saw who was not Song.
The Three Later Yan Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu
Prince Far Hoen, pointing at the steps, said angrily: "You killed the brother of Song?"
Then, without any feeling, he said coldly, "I have commanded him to guard the mountain gates, and he has taken the liberty of destroying the mountain gates to which I came from the east, and I have asked him whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he has the liberty to speak unto the Lord of the caves, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether he knows what is wrong, and whether
As soon as this was said, Prince Fa and others immediately dragged their swords, pointing to Miai, Prince Fa said, "You dare to kill my Blue Temple disciple!"
Be bold! cried Mia, and warned him, "While I am a disciple of any of your sects, since you have joined my Eastern Cave, I must forget the sect's idea of following the rules.
His gun pointed downward, Song is not the first to die in my hands, nor is it the last!
The Three Yan, behind the people, immediately lighted up the weapons, and shouted: Here!
"If any man dare to do this," said he, "these are for me, and the other four are for you to settle."
"Follow me!" ""Follow me!" ""Follow me!" ""Follow me!" ""Follow me!" ""Follow me!" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" ""Follow me!"" """Follow me!"" """Follow me!"" """"Follow me!"" """""Follow me!"" """"""Follow me!""" """"Follow me!"" """"""Follow me
It was a good negotiation, in any case, Song supported the stab, and before Yu decided, anyway, to kill as soon as possible.
The remaining princes, Fa and Zhu Tian, two monks of the three varieties of white linen, who, although they were not able to get rid of them, had the help of a black charcoal foot, and were able to bind the two without any problem.
Of the remaining four, there are three monasteries headed by the emperor, Yang, and the Cheu Shao group, which are also sufficient to deal with.
Once it's really done, the three Yan toss down the four back horses will help Miao to deal with the prince law and Zhu Tian table, the chances of winning are great.
The Blue Temple disciple looked forward on the stairs at the horse, then looked back at the tiger looking at the three, immediately fell into two difficulties.
In the first Battle of Floating Cave, everyone as a bystander saw, Prince Fa and Zhu Tian's coat of arms may not really be able to fight under the sleek, once dragged down, the other four White Lotus two-piece disciples faced Yan Shu the three-piece monk led two attacks, the failure is likely to be great, this battle they did not win.
Moreover, they did not know that Song's death was the result of the joint efforts of Yan Shu and others.
"Here, who dare fight me!"
"You killed our Blue Temple disciples. Blue Blue Temple will find a replacement for you."
The Prince said this, but had put down the sword in his hand, and did not dare to make a second, and the others followed and fell down the sword slowly.
"I don't care about the Blue Gate, I only care about the East Gate. If you don't agree to stay in my East Gate, even if you leave, I won't stop you, and if you want to stay and listen to my orders, I won't lose.
From this day on, but whosoever shall hear the word of my commandment in the eastern part of the cave, three beads of white lotus shall be three beads of rice a year, and two beads of white lotus shall be two; and whosoever shall not hear one bead of my commandment, let him go before me.
As soon as it came out, everyone was astonished, and so were the three Yan Shu, because they had not spoken to him before.
Now there are three priests to take nine, six two to take twelve, twenty-four to take twenty-one, is not the lord of the cave willing to climb up to this position and to give himself only three?
CHAPTER 72
The disciple of the Blue Temple wasted no effort to bind up Yang, for what? Is it not for the wish of the Pearl? Song's help was thrown to the back of the mind, first to clarify whether the cave master's words really said again.
After hesitting, Prince, you are not making us happy. You know that when you do, you yourself will have only three wishes.
It was not finished,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An ordinary pearl, shining with a faint white glow of will be very visible in the night, twisted between the slender fingers is very charming, let all eyes shine.
Everyone is not blind, and the eye is far superior to everyone, this is a gathering of all the wishes of the year!
"Three, two, nothing.""The wishful bead," which had entered into the vault, turned his finger, and looked down at the people, "If you will listen to my orders, I have my own way of getting more, and when you will get it every year, I fear that it will not be more than what I have promised.
Whoever sells his life for me, and whoever does good for me, the Lord of the cave will not give to him.
Excited, each excited, eyes shining!
If there were doubts to begin with, but to see the master can take out a pearl-sized wishful bead with his hand, immediately the heart jumps accelerated, such a level of wishful bead can not be produced in ordinary small town, Yang Qing and the general estimate will not give the wishful bead to the master, the master master is not doing well really have other wishful beads to come.
According to theology, a small temple like Dong, under the order of a monk, no matter how many you are, if you have no relationship with the master of the cave, one year for you, you do not have the temper, Yan Shu in the floating cave is an example.
Now, if, according to Miao, the supply of the power be double triple, then the master of the three of the white lotus to the hundred to the three hundred, and the master of the two of the white lotus to the hundred to the two hundred, what does it mean?
Someone even had a misfortune, rather than fighting to the death, to snatch the wishful beads in the hand of Miao.
But when I look back, I find that is not appropriate, one might not be a sleek opponent, and what is to be taken together?
Even if one could get it, it would only be worth ten millimeters, and it would be possible to get it under the audacity of the promise, that is, for more than three years.
For a monk, three years in the course of training not long, after taking this, after three years, what to do? Is it not to break his own way of finance?
After hesitting to his mind, the prince, with a hard head, held his fist and asked, "Does the lord of the cave speak?
"What do you think of me if I don't say anything," he said.
Prince Far and Zhu looked at the watch, the two turned back to look at their fellow disciple nodded.
All the swords in their hands, they stood in two rows, and cried with a loud voice, "Give me the order of the lord of the cave!"
Seong-dong is the place of his own.
But it is not so easy to say a word that can be spoken by anybody, said Mia, saying, "It is not possible to say it in your mouth.
After everyone looked at each other, once again, with the prince's law, hold the fist and show: "And please the master of the cave show!"
Saying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Everybody understands what he means, which is to get everybody on the matter, but the benefits are not so good.
In fact, I think that is not appropriate, I have been advised many times in private, but the Song Master does not listen, I have no need to wait, after all he is our master.
State Law,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
The others followed with their arches, and answered, "The master of the cave is right in punishment, I will wait and have no doubt!
Yan's three shredded, looked at each other, a little bit hated to scratch the teeth, had not seen such a good talk before the animal before deceiving them three, but now they are so good, all the responsibility to Song's arm.
The three looked at the sleek eyes became a little awe, from the master of the cave saw the means of turning the hand for the cloud to cover the hand for the rain, turning the hand between the whole of the eastern cave turned into the sky, no wonder the lord Yang Qiang has the power to assemble the assembly to let it sit in the town eastern cave!
"Song Fu may be evil, but after all he is a disciple of yours, and at the moment when it is worth cooperating with the Nan Emperor and the Blue Temple, it is not worthy for him to have a relationship with a Song Fu and two families, and it is inevitably to report this, to give an answer to the above.
When he said this, he paused, and glanced at the people, and said slowly, I am afraid that my one word will cause you to doubt the Blue Gate, and if you are willing to testify as one, it will naturally remove the doubt of the Blue Gate.
Do you know who will write down the testimony with me to the Lord of the mountains?
Yan, the three heard, could not help laughing, thinking that the master's hand was cruel enough.
The Prince, and others, they are to understand what is called to be a bitch and to set a table, the man who killed the Blue Temple does not want to be responsible, and wants to let the Blue Temple say the disciple under the door to live, are you not afraid of our Blue Temple, do not put our Blue Temple in the eyes?
"You don't want to write, I don't have to, but there's something you want to be clear about, and once the people of the Blue Gate come and look at it, they'll find out that you can get two or three wishes every year, and they'll be afraid that no one will look after my responsibilities, after all the wishes are bigger than the wishes of the Lord of the Cavern," he said, "and that the Lord of the Cavern will not be as big as I am, and that there'll be some of your neighbors who will try to take you away, and then they'll turn themselves in to serve me, and then I won't be able to stop you," he said.
It's a bit of a weakness, it's not possible, it's sure, and it's sure that somebody will come up with a way to replace them, and the Blue Temple disciple who's been assigned to the lowest level of work has nothing to do with it, and he's got to do something with it.
There are still some figures Nan thought he could not help but whisper in a low voice: "Lord King, Lord Song did not listen to the order of the lord of the cave, until the mountain gate was destroyed, it is indeed to be no excuse for it."
"It's..."
Several people answered in a low voice, and did not dare to say too obvious, in any case, it is such a meaning, believe the master brother can understand.
The Prince of course knows everyone's thoughts, do not want to be taken advantage of by others, but really to do this thing, that is to deceive the master, once on the brave thief's boat will not come down, not for people to be a cow to be a horse.
CHAPTER 73
Why is the temptation of the wish is greater, all willing to run down to the man's control for what? Not for the wish!
Under the w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w
"Nature!"
"Nature!"
Everyone nodded and understood the difficulties of the teacher, this thing is not good to take responsibility oneself, to take responsibility all together, otherwise it will not be safe afterwards if anyone does not feel pain quickly to stab the thing, only all take responsibility to be stable.
When they all agreed, they shouted together, "Let's listen to the Lord!"
Their eyes were filled with admiration for the master of the cave, and for a moment they dragged so many disciples of the Blue Temple into the thief's boat, and they could not resist.
But if you look back, and you find that you and the three are nowhere to go, Song was the one who killed the three by his own hand, and the thing stabs out, and they don't like it, dare to all go to the thief's boat, and no one wants to get down.
"Okay," said Mr. Miaoyi with a flash of silver in his hand, earned a reserve, turned his back on the ride, stood on the steps with his back on his face, "It's too early, you can write things now, I've seen, and if there's no problem, let's send it to the town of Haishan to the lord of the mountain."
Without saying a word, I found out that the owner really didn't want to give anyone a chance to repent, even for one night.
It's done. What can be done?
Immediately Mia raised her hand and said, Yan, give me a token.
Yang Shu ordered, quickly ran into the grand hall, took out a pile of dowry, one by one to the hands of all.
Then a group stood under the steps of the great hall, and each wrote a note.
There are some who, after waving their hands, feel uncomfortable and uncomfortable with the dead brother.
After someone finishes writing, they go upstairs and give things to Miao to check.
After seeing it, he nodded slightly: Good!
After someone had a look at it, Yu frowned, "You write like this, Song seems to be guilty to death, isn't it too lightly written?"
"I'll rewrite. I'll rewrite. "
After looking at another, Mia shakes her head, "It's too much, it's too bad to kill him again," she said.
It's gonna make you can't get off the stage.
Neither of the three have fallen, and have written one.
After all of them wrote a note, saying that Song did not obey the orders, and left the office, so that the mountain gate was destroyed, and dared to hit the lord of the cave, he himself was punished by the law, and to watch for Yu to kill him.
He wrote lower than all others, because he felt that should show the chest of the master, anyway so many people say the bad things of Song, and not the master of the one.
After writing and signing his own French seal, along with the east city master's note that had previously been modified by Yan Shu, he lifted his head and shouted, "One word!
A::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Immediately, star night send these things to the town sea mountain, report to the lord of the mountain, no mistake!
"Yeah!" "Yeah!" "Yeah!" "Yeah!" "Yeah!"
I don't know what expression will be after seeing these tables.
A group of people send the word disappear, thought, really don't want to spend the night.
After finishing the right thing, Miai loosened his voice, and said to Yan Shu: "Notify the lord of the city to come to see me tomorrow morning, to send all the people who are to be sent, not to affect everyone's normal life, to delay everyone's refinement."
Everyone was pleased with this, and a group of people immediately raised their hands, "The master of the cave is wise!"
"Don't be so happy. "You don't think that I don't know what kind of ghost you played with Song before. Song is not good at guarding the mountain gate, so that the mountain gate collapses.
I don't want to see the signs of my east entrance after tomorrow have been knocked down, and you guys have spent the night digging stones for me, and repairing the signboards for the sake of forgiveness, and don't make fun of me, but make it look good, and be cool!
Nobody's going to oppose now, but it's up to the people who are guarding the mountains tonight.
Miao Yi waved to let the people go, and turned back and said to the Cheu Shao group: "Put it in the big hall.
Yasu took Yasu to the private refining and sleeping place of the owner of the back palace, the black coal follows after no matter what rules.
Yan, who was leading the way, couldn't help but ask in a low voice, Master, do you give out so many wishes to everyone every year, is it too much?
He treated himself like a man of heart and mind.
"Why do you think I'm going to send something out when I'm not going to give it to them? " "They're not going to look for their responsibilities, even if they try to look at me."
?
Don't think too much.I'll just say that as long as the wishes are collected enough every year, I'll say the right thing.
He reached for the black char.
"After going out and doing something," I said, "I've come to understand that horses don't have nightmares, and that it's not a good thing to keep a fixed rate here, but we'll have to figure out another way to increase our income."
What he said was not a lie, but a real feeling, not to mention the kindness of the wishes of all kinds of bosses and daughters, the killing of Mor Mortu and Zhang Cheng, and the robbing of one from the lord of the Huangfang, he had a taste of a little bit of a tingle, longing to come east and east to clean up the man's horse ticket, the strength of a man is still too weak.
It was a little uncomfortable for the black charcoal to be stopped in the yard between the front and the rear halls, in front of which was the lodging and the refinement of the master of the seeds, and it was indeed uncomfortable for such a large piece of charcoal to enter, and it had to go straight to the door, lazy.
But here the garden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Seong, who entered his private space with his back, couldn't help nodding, and found that the master's treatment was indeed unusual, the feet were thick blankets, and all around were beautiful displays, and luxurious elegance blended into one, which he had never seen before, and today it is open to the eyes.
Yan's mind is not here, thinking about the master's other way, and want to know where the master's wishful bead of wishfulness gathering all the people a year, trying to ask: "The master's so-called other way to increase the income does not know how to do?
"The best way is, naturally, like the lord, to occupy the whole of Nan. "
Yan was astonished, and even shouted, No, our strength is not enough to swallow the surroundings.
CHAPTER 74
Of course I know, now to rob other people's land, only to fear not to rob the land, on the contrary, to cause others to rob our land.
With a little bit of self-mockery, he shook his head, and turned to sit on the chestnut bed, and asked, "What do you think of our trip to the starship?"
"The Sea of Stars" Yan suddenly stared, and this is where he told Yu.
"What do you want to go to Starship? It's a fairyland filled with fairies! It's a fairyland filled with fairies, and there are almost no human monks who have entered.
"You're not saying that's not good enough for a fairy to replace a thousand wishes?"
It was also the last time Yang saw the war Lu Yu, Yang Shu told him.
Therm and therm can be refined into therm, which is also a source of power, therm is after all therm, which can not be refined, and each time it is used, the amount of energy contained in it is reduced, and the harder it is used, the more energy is consumed, and the natural need to replenish the energy.
So low level fairy is the best fairy energy supplement, there is a market of natural value, to exchange money or to exchange wishes.
Yan jumped with astonishment, "Lord of the cave, do not you think of hunting in the sea of stars?"
"Hah," I said, "I'm joking, seeing you're nervous."
After leaving Yan, he went back into his meditation room to see.
This is an underground space, not small, paved with polished thick stones, copper furnace oil lamp, light is moderate.
In front of a sitting stone, there were three great baths, with the heads of the giants, one of which drew mountain springs, one of which drew hot springs, and the two springs joined together in the other, to make a suitable bath.
Mia took off her clothes and buried them in the pond.
Early the next day, Miao, accompanied by a group of ministers, came to the mountain gate to inspect the newly built mountain gate.
Miaoyi washed up in the quiet room last night, and heard the axe chirping almost a night, and the six monks joined in the work a night, and the board made is not unusual.
There are three.
The main entrance is up to three heights, floating alive birds and beasts, and the clouds hanging between them, on the book 'East come to the cave' three awakening big words, below each one of the dragon sleeping tiger stone carving town guard around.
The whole Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple Temple
To see him like, to be afraid of him deliberately troubled the Blue Temple disciple a bit, last night for the board was to hang the brain.
Everyone laughed when they heard the master of the cave.
"How can I look at your clothes? Those who don't understand think that I'm coming from the Blue Gate.
I don't care if you go back to the Blue Gate, but if you go back to the East Gate, you'll have to bring the colors together.
Yan, go back to the city to find a tailor, to change all the clothes to black.
"Yes," said Yang.
The disciples look at each other.
No matter whether they like it or not, Mia continued to look around at the board.
Just as the crowded around the board, Yan suddenly pointed to the mountain road on the side of the lake: "The master of the cave, should be the master of the eastern city.
When all looked, there was only a handful of people who were rolling along the mountains on the side of the lake, many carrying cars, and cars dragging horses, and they seemed to have brought many things.
Miao washed her eyes, and looked at the lake at the foot of the mountain, and said, Yan, look back and let people have some shrimp in the lake.
Yan, knowing that was probably prepared for black coal, the man, unlike the other wolves, liked to eat fresh fish and shrimp, and liked to play water, there was such a large lake here, turned into a black coal paradise.
"Prince, arrange for a man to guard the gate, and then this part of the mountain gate will be handed over to you to arrange for the men, and then they will be smashed and I will take you to test!
Miaoyi turned his hand and went, the east city lord is not worth standing here to welcome.
The Prince did not have much eyesight, and naturally did not arrange for the owner of the cave's trusted Yan Shu and others to guard the mountain gate, leaving the shopkeepers of the same gate to come and work.
Not long after the others returned to the eastern palace, the lord of the eastern city, Shun Shun, had climbed down the horse before the mountain gate, and the guests and the merchants had come again to inform.
There was no need to inform, the master already knew they came, the merchant came again and let them in.
No one dared to enter by horse, and all the rides were left outside, and only the large loads of cars and wagons that had been dragged behind Shu Shun-ryan were parked on the square outside the palace.
There were also sixteen carriages lifted gently down, and no one dared to lay down, all of which were given to the fairy's maid.
A Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master Master
Others were not allowed to enter the Great Hall, but the east lord of the city, who washed the sweat in his official robe, was afraid to take the box up the steps.
It's not that's what's going to happen to him, it's that every time he comes to the east to change his lord, which is when his lord's position is most insecure, the lord might change you if he sees that you're not paying attention.
In the Great Hall, Yan and others stand on the left and on the right, holding only the box entered Shun Shun did not dare to look up directly, low head to the position and immediately put down the sink of the box, kneeling down and knocking on the head: "The lord of the east city Shun Shun to see the lord of the cave!"
"I'll see you again," said Seung, who sat at the top.
When the lord of the city heard of it, he looked up, and found a little familiar, and immediately became aware of who had saved the fairy of the lady of the season, and did not think that he was the new appointed lord of the eastern chamber, the new lord looked so young!
Come up and speak!
The Lord jumped up immediately, took a small box out of his sleeve, and held it up with him, and said, The Lord Lord, this is the heart of the people of the east, and I hope the Lord Lord will take it.
There was a thing of the Huangfang, Mia didn't look or know what was in there, to Yan Zhu's little head, Yan Zhu immediately went and took the thing.
Chapter 75
Neither did hes the lord of the city, and answered him, and found that the lord of the city of the east was well acquainted with the living of the city, and encouraged him, and let him go.
Neither side has any common language to keep talking.
After the lord of Xu took the people away, Mei let Yan Shu bring the gift to open a look.
Indeed, in the small box there is a blossom of soft and faint grains of rice, the swift and uncompromising, directly into his saving bag.
And there were in the box five thousand, but not a small number: and they were of the city of the east, and of the city of the east.
There was some resistance to receive this kind of thing from the civilian, but not to receive it, the whole Eastern Cave is not he alone, so many people under his hand are to be fed by the Eastern City believers.
However, he did not have any left, so that Yan took some of the gold crystals and distributed them, and two hundred of each of the three pieces of white lotus, and half a hundred of the two pieces of white lotus, and left the rest for the money in the hole, and gave it to Yan Yan to keep.
Yan is in good mood, when floating hole, can not enjoy this management heart treatment.
Then they came out of the Great Hall to the square, and sixteen dressed girls stood in a row, not very old, waiting for the selection of the fairies.
For the first two appearances are more prominent, the pavilion stands, the head hangs low, like two bracts of the flower, the small fresh and pleasant.
The only disadvantage is that the age seems to be young, the body is not fully extended, the point is not sharp, the point is not sharp, nor is it sexy, it can only be said that there is no taste, and there may be people who like it.
Every one of those who were led by Mia looked at each other, and Mia was also a bit irritated, wondering what kind of goods Yan had chosen for himself.
Yan, who was next to Miao, said to the two girls who stood in front of him, "Come, you two, this is the master of the cave that you will serve!"
The two looked at Yan, and quickly looked at the sleek, low head, carefully moved to the side, the two without body, the voice of a bird cry, "Zhao Chen, Liu Snow, see the master of the cave!
The other maids couldn't stop looking at them, and there was a little admiration, even though they were maids of the gods, but as long as the fools didn't know, being maids of the master was not the same as being maids of the others.
They both lifted their heads to see what was going on, and said to him side by side, "They are both 15 years old, and she is a little older, and her name is Zhao Chen, and she is good at dancing.
She's called Liu. She's good at instruments.
Both are trained and do not know whether the master is satisfied.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
Seeing that was not, Yan tried to ask, If the master is not satisfied, can be changed again!
He thought for a moment that although normal men like beauty, he had a determination in his heart, no matter what the conditions, as long as he had not found the old two and the old three, he would not be close to the woman, if the old two and the old three were suffering at this moment, but his brother was enjoying...
But hes his head: Don't change, stay!
Keeping two people around, can also be less disturbance, beneficial training.
Thermenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmen
After everyone had a choice, there were two left, and Yan said to the Jiu Shao group, "These two groups have to go back.
Cheu Shao pointed.
At this time, however, it seemed that there were still two maids, and it was a little strange that Yang had personally been in contact with the eastern city, how did he leave himself alone?
Others may not have noticed, but in a moment, a strange loneliness glimmered from Yan's eyes.
Yan smiled, bowed slightly, " Yan is old, one is used to quiet.
The Prince and others immediately made fun of him, "No, no, no, no.
Nan and Wang Xian both women smiled, all have gained today, the mood seems to be good.
Yan smiled with a sweaty face and raised his hand to ask forgiveness.
The shameless woman, who jumped with a knife, washed her head and was humiliated, but was finally cut off the head...
Mia suddenly flickered across the screen, stared silently at Yan Shu for a moment, slowly turned his head, no more to say.
But he knew what Yan was for, to be honest, he had had little to say about Yan Yan because of the death of Roger, but today it seemed to him that there was something in this old man's habit of boasting that he was afraid it would be impossible to erase.
Along with those who died in the wake of the explosion, the Cheu Shao group, too, thoughtfully glanced at Yan, silently...
After each of them took their own maid back, Yan also called the two maids followed by苗毅.
The full-fed black coal still lay sleeping at the entrance to the back of the house, and the snake's tail swung to the ground, and was quite leisurely, and it was the old disease of the man.
Hearing the silence, he opened his eyes and looked, and saw that he had returned, sneezed, and closed his eyes again.
Several people stood in the yard, Zhao Chen and Liu Xu carefully examined the surroundings, the first curiosity and tension.
"They're just here," said Mei, "and they don't know what to do," he said. "You can arrange for them, and I'll take Zhu's watch to the consulate."
This is the first thing to do when you first come to the cave, it is not possible to sit on the side of the town without being familiar with your own territory, the first time to spend time or spend.
As soon as he came out, the black had his eyes open, his ears straight, and his head half raised.
Yan quickly shouted to leave, pointed to the two girls, reminded: "The master, you have not given them a name.

Yan smiled, "It was a common name, and now they are the owners of the caves, and according to the logic, the owners of the caves are given a new name, which means a new beginning of the supernatural, and everyone has done so.
"That's it," said Mia with a twist of his head. Although he had learned some culture from the old man, the ink in his belly was limited, and naming was not something he was good at, he finally laughed: "Zhao Chen, Liu Chen, you'll call Chen and Chen later!"
He got the name of the ministry, Yan shu shu shu, not good to say, turned back to the two waiters reminded: Don't thank the lord the name!
The two girls hurried to the ceremony, " thousands, snow, thank the Lord for the name! "
CHAPTER 76
Miaoyi put on his hands, didn't say much, didn't care for the two waitresses, thrown directly to Yan, turned away by a big step.
Outside the hall, the first to be greeted by the Zhu had changed his clothes waiting.
As soon as he came out, the black charcoal ran out from behind, snatched his clothes and dragged them away.
Zhu's eyebrows were frowning, and he felt a little overwhelmed. This was the Great Hall of the Eastern Chamber of Commerce, but the animal was like a circle running in and out, the top beams were wrong, the beams were wrong, and the master was accustomed to it, and he took a few whips to be honest.
Miao will not use whip, saved his life not to say, running faster than others is the advantage, can also play a mixed catch of fish, and the people who used know the advantage.
"I've got something to do. it's not convenient to take you to the lake, where there are shrimp.
Raise your fingers toward the lake.
The Black Coal opened his mouth, shook his head, sneezed, and flew to the square, leaving four feet to run.
The Lord's riding is a bit spiritual, and I can speak to it directly. It's not like I'm going to be able to ride, it's like the Lord's riding.
This guy is like a duck. It makes you feel like a duck.
Mei smile, know it is good to listen, black charcoal morality does not appeal to the outsider like he knows, like Qin Wei would like to kill it, but occasionally enjoy the taste of pissing is good, though this pissing is not good.
Outside the mountain, there were two horses left by the lord of the east.
Go to the city to see what you want to see, too, to see what is the power of the lord of the city, if not, to delay the wish of the pearl, the lord of the cave is afraid that it will not be long, to change the lord of the city or to change, to send a gift is not useful.
Out of the mountain gate,,,,,...
Zhenhai mountain, the plate sits in a quiet room, Qin Wei slowly compressed the two hands on Dan, the eyes of a flower open six petals of the flower lights resembling alive.
When she opened her eyes, she gazed at the red cotton and the green lily and said with joy, "Congratulations to the lord of the mountain on the construction of the upper floor.
Qin took hold of the force, the wishful pearl of the mouth, stretched out the legs of the bed, laughed, shook the head, "but just broke through the six of the white lotus.
She could see it in her mouth, but the invisible cheer of her face indicated her mood.
The two waiters laughed without saying anything.
It fell by the shirt, and soon, an arrogant fat before and behind was exposed in the quiet room, white spots of aromatic grass, it is estimated that even a woman looked will be heart pounding accelerated.
A pair of white,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Red cotton and green grass helped her to remove hair and the two helped her to clean slowly.
While Qin washed her full chest with a white towel in her hands, she smiled, "The mountain lord is a good figure, and it is a pity not to find a double-trained official with such a good posture.
"No," said the back of the green lily, laughing and laughing. "It's just a wild thing!"
Qin's face turned red, and stared at her, "Two shy little girls!"
At one time the water splashed in the pool, the two ladies dare to return the hand, only to constantly beg forgiveness.
When ther was done, ther said with a straight face, Lord, I tell you a secret, that the lord had asked the two of us privately.
Qin Wei, who opened a pair of jade arms to wipe the two, immediately wondered: "What did the lord invite you to ask?
"The lord listened to the two of us, and asked if you had a pleasant man, and if he had, he would have thought of a way to arrange for you in secret.
Qin's face turned red again and said, Dad's not in shape!
The next time he asks, you tell him I'm not looking for.
"We don't dare say this to the lord," he laughed, "whether we think it's our advice, or we'll come back to you when you find a nice man."
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
Turn around and look at me, and if you're with men, look at the faces of the men who treat the maids as maids, and at the end they're not even maids of the house, and think of it!
Green Liu shut up and didn't dare to speak, but even the lord screamed in.
Red Cotton smiled,The mountain lord will wait,and we will help the mountain lord to see if the status of the mountain lord is suitable,and not the man who sleeps with the attendants.
Don't be ashamed, Don't you both have a thrill?Get you two to the man's room to be a concubine!
Asked what was right, Red Cotton smiled and said, "It's nothing, it's just that the east and the west have sent the evening messengers, and the messengers are still waiting in the mountain, waiting for the Lord's commandment to return to life!"
The guy hasn't been there yet, and he's on the piano so fast, isn't he making fun of me?
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
Shortly after returning, he took the sealed box with the playing table, opened and placed on the side of the pool.
Qin Wei held the side of the black hair on the snow white shoulder, leaned on the side of the shore, reached into the box and touched...
Why so many instruments, doesn't the guy write a long poem?
Take a piece of doom injected into the force to see, finish one and quickly see another.
As a result, it is foolish to look at, first to shake, then to look more and more confused.
After finishing, I thought I had the wrong look, and screeched, I looked at all the playing tables again carefully.
After finishing the second time not reassment, again the child carefully check, see if there is a foot to do.
Yang finally placed by the shore, Qin Wei's eyebrows tightened, his eyes sometimes flickered confused and puzzled, his mouth sometimes whispered, "What did this guy do..."
Without daring to disturb the master's public affairs, the red cotton and the green willows have seen Qin Wei something wrong, and do not know what the master of the seedling seedling hole wrote, can make the master of the seedling so, but did not see the master of the anger!
Look at the red cotton and the green柳 face, look at the quantity of the Yuan play is really enough, a play of the eastern to the whole town Haishan to the play of the master of the tower.
CHAPTER seventy- Qin Wei
Waiting half an hour, to see Qin Wei came out late, Red cotton tried to ask quietly, "Lord mountain, is there anything to the East come out?"
Qin, who had come back from God, still a little confused, not knowing what to say, raised his hand slightly, "Look, help me analyze what's going on down there.
Because of the maid's identity, this kind of thing, without the mountain master speak, the two do not dare to see.
Because of Qin Wei's state of mind, both want to know what is written in the dowry, now there is a mountain master's speech, the two are compelled to take the dowry to see.
I don't know, after seeing, two women too.
After the two women exchanged and looked at, also evidently had the same doubts as Qin Wei, worried whether it was a fake, again looked and checked again, twice.
However, the ten instruments are clearly written by ten different magicians, and the signatures on the instruments are unmistakable, like the fingerprints of everyone.
Finally, the green lily, holding the ultimate, said: "The owner of the seed hole is great! In the middle of the night he has taken over the whole eastern part of the hole!"
Qin, who was thinking about it, couldn't help turning his eyes white, looking back, and laughing, "Well, what about him, do you think it's possible?
"It's kind of weird!"
Both of them have been with Qin Wei for a long time, and are well aware of the situation in Nan Province.
For the lord Yang, the introduction of the blue jade gate, is to draw the wolf into the room.
Initially, Yang didn't want to retaliate, and wanted to accumulate power slowly, but the original lord Lu Yu couldn't see Yang Yang making a big, under the orders to Yang Yang to the side of the office, to disguise Yang Yang.
Yang knows that once he's gone to Liu Yu's side, Liu Yu won't have another chance to get ahead of himself.
It was because of Lu's action that Yang had to cut off the airplane and promised to cooperate with the Blue Gate, to kill Lu Lu and attack the southern province.
Yang and Blue Temple of course each gain, but some things both know well.
Knowing that Yang is not a person, must think of a way to cut off the influence of blue jade on Nan.
Young also knows that Blue Gate is not afraid to come now, but once lent by this entry, slowly connected up and down the relationship, will surely think of a way to take him Yang Qing instead.
It is because of the number of people who have worked in the system over the years, and because of the help of the lord, Yang Qing has not been able to admit that even if he beat Nan Chen, Nan Chen does not belong to him, instead it is not good to bear the guilt of counterfeiting.
Blue Gate does not dare to create a seed, which is missing is also the human blood, does not dare to fight against the huge institutional power.
However, if the relationship was tolerated, the people under the rule of the Southern Emperor could be more than the people under Yang, once it was difficult for Yang to resist.
Both sides understand that cooperation is temporary, at most after fifty years, both sides will have to tear their faces, and see when who is in the upper hand, in any case not the east wind over the west wind over the east wind.
Because of Yang's lack of people, such a large southern province, although the main positions are controlled by the people, but the secondary positions are almost taken by the people of Blue玉门.
No but other mountains, Zhenhaishan presently face this situation, Qin Wei also faces the people below the Blue玉门阳阴违, just because Qin Wei is Yang Qing's working daughter, under her direct control of the Blue玉门 disciple is not afraid to tell Qin Wei how much to give Yang Qing face now.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
All nine of the masters sent a complaint, resulting in the worst of the the masters, instead sent the only good news.
Only one of the Master of the Cave was able to kill a disciple of the three of the White Lotus, which would have caused a stir between the Blue Lotus and Yang Qing.
The Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue
Seeing this good news, Qin Wei was not happy at all, but filled with suspicion, the bastard has just gone, only in the middle of the evening, can the whole East come hole to manage a barrel of iron?
In particular, the disciples of the Blue Temple tightly united in the side of the master of the
Are you kidding?
What is it? Is it foolish to beat the faces of the other nine masters, or to beat the faces of her mountain master, Qin Wei?
Their testimony can't be faked!
Isn't the man called Song really so evil?
But how evil can this be that all the disciples of the Blue Temple are blind?
Qin Wei shook his head slightly, and felt not right, that Song, even worse, the disciples of the Blue Temple can not condemn each on the playing table, the expression supports Miaodong.
The bastard has just gone, and so low, why so great prestige?
If you say something like Wang's shock, you don't believe in killing Qin Wei.
Red cotton and green willows, too, with a look of uncertainty.
Don't wash, don't wash your clothes, and bring me that letter!
Qin Wei stood up from the water, the shore, the sheep fat burst out a mist, the surface of the pearl instantly disappeared.
The two waitresses immediately helped her to dress in socks, a set of hair, six snow-white jackets inserted into the butterfly-like locks of the hair on the back of her head.
In the Great Hall, the face cold mountain lord Qin Wei high sit on.
However, no matter what Qin asked, he was convinced that Song did not obey the orders of the lord of the cave, so that the mountain gate was destroyed, and that the lord of the cave was not respectful, and that the lord of the cave was killed to watch.
Qin Wei did not need to have too much doubt about the possibility of not killing the monastery of the three monasteries of the White Lotus, also seen in the Battle of Floating Cave, and later heard about the monastery of the two monasteries of the three monasteries of the White Lotus died, and the one who completed the task came back, so it is possible to say that the monastery of the three monasteries of the White Lotus killed a Song Fu.
But she's not a fool, so easy to let all the Dong Blue Temple disciples follow on the table to help Miao to get rid of the responsibility?
Simply, you're sure there's nothing to hide from me?
The bottom people don't know the top struggle, the only meaning is to know that they themselves participated in the killing of Song, once admitted, do not say that the side of the east come to the hole can not tolerate themselves, the Blue Gate people have to retaliate themselves, and more to do with the doubling of the power of the pearl.
So killing can't be the truth, it's just one bite, it makes Qin Wei a little uncomfortable, it feels like Dong Dong is really being handled by the fuckin' between a dinner and a barrel of iron.
You can't just say good luck to that bastard who just hit a whole bunch of dead people?

As soon as the word went out, the red cotton asked, "Lord of the mountains, is this to be reported to the lord of the province?"
"Now that's not clear, how do you get me to stuff the papers?
Qin Wei shook his head and immediately let the green leave to pass on a disciple of the Blue Temple.
After a disciple of the Blue Temple entered to see the lord of the mountain, Qin Wei asked: "Your neighbor Song, can you know?
"Song" ""Song" ""Song" ""Song" """Song"" ""Song"" ""Song"" ""Song"" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song""" ""Song"""" ""Song""" """Song""""""""Song"""""""""Song""""""""""Song""""""""""Song""""""
Qin asked: "How does Song help his people?"
Once again, I don't know why the mountain master asked this, but naturally hold the boxing saying: "Song master brother is for people stubborn and simple, the respectful master reassures, the personality is indisputable!"
He doesn't care what happened to Song and doesn't care whether his relationship with Song is good or bad, but when facing strangers, the same door is to maintain the same door, and in the case of uncertainty, saying good things is definitely right.
Qin waved his hand and pointed at the figure who had left the door, and said to the red cotton and the green lily standing on the left and right: See? That is what the master brother should say, and certainly not like all the people who come to Dongdong, that is not common sense!
"What do you want to do, Lord?"
Qin stood up and said,Hearing is false, seeing is true, I will go to Dong to see for myself, to see if the people of Dong Dong are really so enthusiastic about our great, small-sized lord!
Greenwood tried to ask,If they really love?
"It's not possible," said Qin, "but there must be a ghost in there, and if I'd really taken it, I'd have my lord's seat given to him."
If he can endure this, let him deal with the disciples of the Blue Temple of Zhenhaishan, and let the lord spare more of his mind!
Red and Green Liang looked at each other and knew that the mountain lord was saying something that could not be true, but as soon as they had been appointed, you had to go down and check, and it seemed a little...
It wasn't long before the simple meaning of the reply was finally able to go back to the East.
Nevertheless, he did not relax, but instead hesitated all the way, because the mountain lord Qin Wei led several people along with him!The mountain lord had just been appointed, and invited the mountain lord, Oh!
It's hard for some thieves to get on the boat! Though there might be holes everywhere, there might be leaks everywhere, but the people who got on the boat had to work together hard to get on the boat, and if they didn't get on the boat, they would be drowned, and there would be a line of life to get on the boat.
Miaoyi also doesn't know what's wrong between Yang and Blue玉门, the bottom person is in this state, can't do anything, and moreover he has just surrendered Yang Yang not long, inside information doesn't know much.
Standing in his position, I am the legitimate owner of the Eastern Cave, the Eastern Cave man is natural to listen to me, not listen to the words I am natural to settle the horse, is it not possible to drag it down slowly?
Who knew that he could handle the whole east entrance with the quickness of not covering his ears, but that he had made it to the top.
But I don't know the benefits of the unknown, at least for a while.
Meanwhile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zhu's watch is still a hog, you don't speak, he basically doesn't speak, and occasionally does not like to take a shit, only knows hand to hand sword follow, like a guard follow.
Miaoyi brought him out as a guard, and there was a monk with three white leaves who could withstand anything.
There was a red building in front of the road, and people gathered, and surrounded a large group of people, and I don't know which house the girls were throwing embroidery balls, and attracted the passing Mia Yi and Zhu Ten watch more eyes, but did not stay.
The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House The Embroidery House
At this time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides, there were guards behind, and at a glance it was a person of identity.
As soon as she bit her teeth, her two arms pushed the embroidery ball past, and her hand was strong and balanced, and she was not to be the master of embroidery balls, if she hadn't practiced two times, then throwing a bad old head would not have been a big problem.
As soon as the embroidery ball flew, the crowd under the embroidery building stretched out their arms, but saw it flew from the top.
Their eyes looked forward, waving their hands, the embroidery ball hit again flies back to the embroidery building.
Zhu's watch was only a glance, and silently followed behind Miao, wagging shoulders with the crowd this side.
The girl staring at the embroidery with the flying embroidery, looking at the two embroiderers, the silver teeth slowly bite the lips, to the daughter's family, the face was lost, the embroidery thrown out was thrown back, it was unheard of.
The people under the embroidery floor were astonished, and each of them, with their pews, sent the two away, and then turned back and shouted, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss
The lady bit her teeth and went away, and disappeared into the embroidery building.
Inside the city, there is a river crossing, Zhu Tian table to the shore of the bow to ask the price of the boat, and with the Miaoyi twin to the tent small boat.
Their companions waved and carried them along the river.
Zhu holds his sword behind.
As the caravan went, a sounded on the shore, and the man looked back, and saw only the embroiderer's maid, with her horses chased by several great men.
"Sit for me," said the young woman, pointing at the head of the ship.
He looked around, while no one noticed, he tried to illuminate the flower illusion to the other, trying to make the other know hard to turn back.
Who knows the other still chase the horse, is not afraid of the fairy?
This man is now addicted to this thing, for no reason, to make it too low, when the master is also afraid that others will not see, just hide the illusion of the flower of the eye of the heart table, so that no one will see good laugh.
Only thermal transmission indicated the lower thermal.
Zhu looked back coldly at the lady, the illusion of the eye of the flower revealed, suddenly astonished the lady and others, stopped the horse not to make the next.
Miss Harun wakes up, understands why the other does not respect himself, feels the difference between the two, abnormally grieved to bite the lips...
For Seung, this is just a little interlude.
CHAPTER 79
On both sides of the small river, Yang, you can see a woman squatting on the shore washing her dishes.
There was also a blue building, where the girls waved their palms, and with their soft voices, looked at the branches of the exhibition, and invited the tourists who stood by the ship.
Again, on the banks of the river, the princes accompanied, singing, trying to attract a crowd of three, two, three, two, but the girls, with their red faces, quietly peeked at the princes on the tent, standing on the ship's head, breathtaking.
On the flower boat, which washed itself with the cloak, the thick powder of the old whale also loudly invited the prince of the ship to drink the flower.
Thermenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmen

To live by water is the nature of man, by boat all the way, is to see all the prosperity of the east city.
The people of this world, though to spend three hours each day to contribute to their will, and to pay the tax, but also as a result of the guardian of the monks, to defeat the demons, to expel the demons, to keep the peace.
The Six Saints of heaven and earth are also able to accumulate as little as they can, and to seize as much of their will, or even if their power is stronger, they will not be able to take such a large place.
It was also because of the existence of these monks, the mighty of the government did not dare to overwhelm the believers, stirring up the adoption of the will, the monks would not let them first
Although the monks do not often appear as lords, they do indeed stabilize the order of the world.
Of course, not all people along the river side like ordinary people take out three hours every day to contribute to their will.
Therefore, as hard as hard, as well as the people of the heavens are not affected, some are busy and some are restless is the law of life in the world.
Nevertheless, for those who stand at the head of the cruise, this is their own territory, seeing under the jurisdiction of the believers live and play, fearing that at the end of the year will not be able to successfully pay the pledge of the Pearl can be temporarily dropped...
The darkness, riding the dragon rowing under the star moon, simply means a heart seven eight.
Looking ahead to the east to the cave, it means to the hard head accelerate to the top, a little behind Qin Wei, holding a fist, "The master, the subordinates immediately go to the cave to inform the master, let them meet the master, the driver."
He's actually trying to get people to read the news and get them to be psyched first.
Qin looked back at him cold hum: No.
Then he ordered the man who followed him, "Look at him, don't give him the chance to send a letter, I want to see what the east-east hole is doing!
With a glance, the two monks of the three varieties of white roses had come quickly, and had put him in the middle.
Five men, in the moon, came straight east to the gate of the cave, and the speed was as rapid as the lightning.
The merchant who guarded the gate came out of the darkness and stopped in the middle of the mountain gate.
The sounded back and again to the others in the cave.
As soon as the news came out, the people in their respective training homes quickly flew away to the "Long Valley," six shadowmen carrying weapons, riding with the speed of six lions to prepare for uncertainty.
Qin Wei, not so much as to do the wrong thing to hit the mountain gate, has raised his hand to stop the people behind him, with the five people he leads urgently to sit under the donkey, to stop in front of the mountain gate, in exchange for the ordinary people must instantly throw out.
Only on the other side of the mountain gate was there a quick gathering of six cows.
Qin was a little surprised, didn't think the reaction of the East came so fast, this efficiency is unusual.
That's what Mia said before, that if the mountain gate were to be broken again, we'd have to look for the prince's account.
Miao also said, I don't listen to, when I wish I didn't give a pear, I still have to go!
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
Seeing is the mountain lord Qin Wei, the storekeeper came again immediately shut up, hold the fist.
Immediately came to the uncertain Yan Shu and others face to face, also quickly turned off the ride, quickly walked to the mountain gate, hugged and greeted.
Many glanced at the simple meaning of accompanying Qin Wei, seeming to blame the lord of the mountain why not come early to greet.
Some even questioned the meaning in the dark.
However, it is a painful word, and both have made preparations to prevent him from broadcasting, and to interfere in front of him.
Qin, looking up at the mountain gate, hum, "This place is better than the southern province! "
Everyone heard that was not good, and didn't know what to say.
Qin wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi wi
Uniformity is trapped behind Qin Wei entered the Great Hall.
There was nobody in the hall, and Qin Wei went straight to the hall where the lord of the cave lived.
The black coal in the back of the yard was lying at the door of the one who loosely tail, the tail from time to time clattered on the ground gently, as soon as the open eyes see Qin Wei immediately two eyes flipped up, seemingly a little unknown where to hide.
Under pressure, black coal jumped several hundred meters high, fell outside the house, hurried to escape.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
She didn't like black charcoal, but she didn't even go to her own house at night, to kill herself on her own horse, to do such a small thing, she couldn't have lost that face.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
Qin, who came out of the room, looked around, saw the lights on the one side of the chamber, and immediately went away, 'Bang' a foot opened the door.
As a result, two beautiful maids dressed in blasphemy shouted, crowded together, looking inside Qin Wei shivered.
Obviously, living in the owner's back house, must be a swift waiter.
Qin Wei looked at the waiter who was behind, and looked at the irony, as if to say, look, the men are all the way.
Red cotton smiled, this time only she followed, green herb did not come.
There were no shadows of the brave in the room. Qin Wei looked at the two frightened little girls coldly and asked, "Where are your masters gone?"
The two little girls shook their heads.
Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus
It's true! Yan, one of the people outside the large hall, ran into the room straight away, wagging his head.
CHAPTER EIGHT
Qin asked,Where is Xi?
Yan smiled, "The cave master has visited the territory.
Qin and Wei, finding that guy really reassuring about the home, just come and dare to throw the thing of the cave out to visit.
Ask again, When will he come back?
This............
Qin whispered: Then bring him back to me at once.
Yan suddenly wanted to cry without tears, "The lord of the mountain, the whole of the eastern cave is so big..."
I didn't dare to say that big place where you let us go to find him!
Qin Wei thought it seemed to be a bit of trouble for the people, did not correct on this matter, began to call in each person to ask the Song was killed, what happened to the condemnation on the table.
"Are you threatened by any means?"
"Why did the lord of the mountains say this? The lord of the caves never threatened us, only hated the Song, and I could not see down, even though I was at the same gate."
It's no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
There were obviously cats in there, but these people, whether they were Yan Shu and others who were sent by themselves, or the people of the Blue Gate, were held together like iron buckets, and they were neither dead nor free.
Qin Wei is ready to return to calculate.
Nao has been waiting for three days and has no idea when the guy will come back.
What made her unspoken was that even if the owner of the cave was not there, a group of subordinates would keep the affair of the cave in order.
Other disciples of the Blue Temple were not willing to guard the mountains and to deal with things, and were not seen in the Eastern Cave, on the contrary, Yan Shu and others of the swift and devoted followers did not have to do this, all of the disciples of the Blue Blue Temple were doing their duties faithfully.
Moreover, the Prince and others to Yan's attitude is obviously very courteous, thus can be seen to the attitude to Miao Daidong master.
Look at the lord of the great cave, and in the middle of the evening he will give to the east the cave, and in the eyes of the governor there will be great glory.
Whoever appoints himself is unable to deal with each hole, and whoever is unwilling to appoint is unable to deal with each hole, and whoever is unwilling to appoint is unable to deal with each hole, and whoever is unwilling to appoint is unable to deal with each hole.
Didn't heal the old blood of the silent Qin Wei? Didn't he measure the king's belly with the heart of a small man?
It's autumn, and she can't stay here forever, and the ghost knows when Miao will come back.
After three days, finally took the people away, did not know what she wanted to do, in any case, to take the meaning also.
You've got to go to the front of the mountain gate, Yan, and others in the hearts of seven to eight, each to the simple meaning, to look at, you've got to get over!
It was clear to all of us that if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren't able to do it, if we weren
Yan and others killed the Blue Temple disciples.
But the people of the Blue Gate are waiting to do the thing of betraying the master.
Now there is this quiet, the people of the Blue Gate are both afraid and regret, regret how in the beginning on the steamer boat, to face Qin Wei Xu is not afraid to take the boat, and to do all the hard work with all the people everywhere leaking water eyes to see the steamer boat will sink not return to the shore.
Qin, who noticed the expressions of all, with a cold face, the more sure there was a ghost.
The waiter, glancing at the master, could not help laughing, thinking that no matter what cats were, they could hold together, and it was clear that the owner of the mine had made the people fit for the purpose, and it was no wonder that at first the people would dare to throw things into the mine, no matter how far they ran, the other mines had mainly this ability, and the towns and mountains were done.
I don't know what the mountain lord says, if the mountain lord really gets the support of the command, the mountain lord's position let the mountain lord sit is really...
Qin Wei obviously saw her thoughts, gave her a glance, saying angry thing can be true?
Qin Wei did not stop, after asking if there was anything important, and with a single meaning directly to the southern province.
Young's closest relatives just took office and killed the Blue Temple disciples, it is not possible to conceal this, it will be revealed soon, the Blue Blue Temple whether or not to react, at least to ask, Qin Wei must personally reveal the details, so that Yang Qing has a number in mind before.
Knowing I'm going to Nan Province, I'm a little confused, I don't think it's necessary anymore.
People at the bottom don't know what's at the top, and the dark angle involved is complicated, and if they do, they don't have the courage to do it at first.
After arriving at Nan Province, Qin Wei met Yang Qing did not need to inform.
Following Qingqing to the highest pavilion in the back of the mountain, saw Yang is sitting to refine.
Qin Wei, in a white dress like snow, said.
In the case of others, Qin Wei has always maintained the up and down of Yang Qing, only in the very private case to call 'Father'.
After finishing his work, he opened his eyes and threw out a wishful blossom the size of a quail in his mouth, and smiled, "How did you come?
He got up and sat down by the side of the tea, stretched out his hand, and indicated to sit down and speak.
Qin Wei sat on the other side of the tea, "Lord, the lord of the east to the south is afraid to cause you trouble.
Yang said, "Oh," with a little frowning, "What's the matter with him?"
"The lord oversees himself," said Qin, placing before him a box with a musical instrument.
After Yang opened, too, was confused.
With a glance at Zing and Zhong, Yang quickly re-examined a copy of the warrant again.
He was a man who was able to do things. He was not as astonished as Qin Wei was at first, but rather astonished.
"I don't know what's going on," he said. "I ran to the east to see what was going on, and the young man went out and toured the territory..."
Qin Wei gave a detailed account of what she had seen.
After listening, Yang touched the table gently, pondered for a long time, shaking his head, also unable to, finally voiced, "The man who brought you here, I ask myself.
Simplification was soon summoned, for the first time face to face with Yang such high up person, plus the soul of a ghost, this guy nervous can not.
But one thing he did, depending on what Yang asked, he still repeated the old saying.
Yang didn't turn around like Qin Wei asked, rose slowly to the bar of the pavilion, looked at the distant mountain view, one hand slowly back, face no expression, calmly said: drag out, cut!
Zhao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chapter 81
It's not a joke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Qin took a glance at the simple meaning of being dragged away, without saying anything, Mia after all is Yang Qing the person, she does not give the face of Mia also give the face of Yang Qing, it is not good to do without any evidence of the abuse of the hand of Mia Mia, but Yang Qing can do, did and no one can say.
He wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He knew Yang might be frightened of himself, mainly to ask for the inside, but he knew more Yang Yang had spoken out, and if he didn't give Yang Yang a satisfactory answer, Yang Yang wouldn't have changed his mind for himself the shrimp, and killed himself for no reason to others.
"Lord, I am wrong," I said, "please give me another chance, Lord," I said, "I said..."
Their faces were white as they struggled to beg forgiveness.
Yang's head, looking at the distant mountains, didn't return, just released a hand from behind, and lifted it a little.
A glance, the two loosened a single meaning.
The uncertain sense of panic, crashed into the pavilion, kneeled behind Yang, and said with a pale face, "Lord, I say!"
Yang asked quietly, "Why are the people of the Blue Gate on the table condemning Song?"
"It's all done by the owner...
He's been pushed!
After the most difficult to say this word, the simplicity face of bitterness, if after this thing the sleek is still the master of Dong Dong, in the future Dong Dong is afraid not to tolerate itself.
Plum and Chrysanthemum listen.
Qin Wei's eyes flicker, is the end of the mystery to be revealed?
Anyone can guess what kind of pressure must have been on the people of the Blue Gate, but does not know what kind of means of suppression has been used.
"Before," said Yang, "because of the consequences."
Despite his calmness, he put a great deal of pressure on him, because he understands that if he hears something wrong, he will be able to decide his life or his death in a moment, and he will not have any chance of rebelling.
"Lord, it is true that the disciples of the Blue Temple did not listen to the orders of the ruler before the lord of the Miao-dong came to the east, and instead they went to and to and to, and to and to, and to and to, and to and to, and to and to, and to and to.
On that day, as soon as I came east to the gate of the cave, I saw no one guarding the gate of the cave, and I was filled with anger.
Simply puts things through fifteen or ten years of truth.
As soon as the three heard of Yan, they rushed to the front of the mountain gate, and they were angry at why no one looked after the mountain gate, and Yan Yan did not complain about the blue jade.
Blue Gate Song and others come late, and also speak of shyness.
Hearing this, Yang, who was looking back at the people, had squinted a little, had squinted a little in the seams of his eyes, and he was the one who sent him, and everyone knew that he was his friend, and even his friend had been appointed.
"What did your cave owners do then?" asked Yang.
"Then the master didn't say two words, directly drinking orders, immediately go to Zhenhaishan to report to the master, saying the blue jade turned, scared the blue jade disciples one jump, a group of people so hard to see the young master, the result is that the young master didn't give the face, on the spot drinking to white linen repaired Song Fu watch over the mountain gate, even though Song Fu refused to answer, and directly drive the wolf to them crashed past!"
With a smile on his back, he could imagine what he was at that time, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, and what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what he was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was, what was
"What about the back? How did the back of Song help to kill?" asked Yang.
"In fact, Song was not killed by the lord of the cave, but by his subordinates, Yan, and by the Cheu Shao group together..."
To this point, simplicity will not hide any more, continue to speak.
Saying that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that was that that that that that that was that that was that that was that that was that, that that that was that, that that that was that, that that was that, that that was that, that that was that, that that was that, that that was that, that that was that, that that was that, that that was that, that was that, that that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that, that was that,
In the after, the Cheu Shao group smashed the mountain gates, stirred up the quiet, and the Miaoyi excuse jumped, while searching for the enemy to disperse the disciples of the Blue Temple, called Song Fu to the east to the Great Hall to question the sin, Song Fu did not confess, the long-planned Yan Shu, Uniformity and the Cheu Shao group had sneaked back, with the Miaoyi order, the three joined up, and the Song Fu to be executed inside the Great Hall.
Afterwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After that is what happened.
When they looked at each other, they found that the lord of the mine was a very small man, and that it was not enough for him to be wise, and that when he had come to the mine in a few days, he had given the whole of the mine to the fire, and that was a good thing.
Qin Wei's silver teeth bit the red lips, and the riddle is clear, she now rather had a sense of the earlier than not to be clear, and listened to the little boy play the wind, it seems that the whole town Haishan the guy is able to endure, to make her heart very uncomfortable.
Yang closed his eyes for a moment, then slowly turned around and looked down on the knee and said, "Arise!
"Thank you," he said, "I don't know what's going to happen next."
Who knows Yang didn't blame him, but said, Don't let anybody know what you say today, you'll never have anything happened, and nobody will investigate what happened to you, and what will happen to you in the future, I promise you to report directly to the lord of the town Haishan, do you understand what I mean?
As soon as he was surprised, he understood what Yang meant by saying to himself that he would not go out and that he himself had designated himself as the east entrance to the cave, indicating that he had entered Yang Yang's law eye, he did not think that bad had turned into good.
Understand Understand Understand Understand!
The shock was so great that it almost made him turn.
Chapter 82
"Thank you," said Yang with a smile.
Immediately a pale blooming soft and faint pearl of rice emerged from the watch.
"Thank you, thank you!"
"Come back!" said Yang.
After a long walk down the mountain, Yang ha smiled two voices, shaking his head, "When he was on the job, he sneaked into his mountain door, thanks to the little boy thought out, really dare to do.
A::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Before I let him sit down in the east of the town just to see how many people will listen to my words in the southern province, can I say a word nine, not in the spirit of use, just to see who will jump out and stop, really put him in the east of the town I was a little worried that it was right or wrong, now it seems that little boy was capable, but I was worried.
A glance at Zhou and Zhou Qiu, all saw Yang's more and more appreciation of Zhou Yi, as soon as the time is sure to be reused, as the two of the maid's hearts also counted, afterwards to the master of Zhoudong not too lively.
Qin left her mouth and looked a little uncomfortable.
Who knows Yang has smiled to look at the name, asked, Wei, I kiss you the Eastern Cave Cave Lord did not look away?
He knew, of course, that was not the right thing to do with his daughter.
Qin, however, did not like to hear this, rising to his side, said not well: "He is playing now, I see that he can not be so painful as now, when he is behind to bring out the wishes of the pearl to fulfil the commitments of the opponent!
Yang, laughing, pointed at her and shook his head, "You! You! You, the man who gave you a kiss for your father, don't you see the eyes like this?
Don't you think of all those who are held by him, who have done anything to betray the Master, and who dare to betray him even after he has fulfilled his promises?
Qin Wei wasted no words!
Yang went back and sat down, signing, "If there were more talents like that little boy in my southern province, Blue Temple would not be concerned, and the southern province would do well."
Qin said with a frown, "Lord, do you not feel that little man is too deep in his heart after this?
Yang shook his head: "If you were serious, you wouldn't have trouble hitting the door straight away. Instead, you would communicate well with yourself, arrange the way back, and not take responsibility afterwards. He did this to show that he took it for granted to do this, and then run out as if nothing happened.
Qin didn't feel any better, she whispered.I don't think that guy is any kind of shame, just that you appreciate him, and look at him.
"It doesn't matter whether you look at him or I don't like him.
I have sent him to remove the ghosts in the territory of Longfeng, the two monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of the three monks of
Qin Weimer didn't say anything, she knew Yang was right, but she couldn't deny her reluctance to be shy, just look at the guy is not cool!
Knowing a woman is not a father!While looking, Yang Qian shook his head, knowing that sometimes it is difficult to turn the mind of a daughter, this thing does not demand...
The port of the east city, look at the blue sea, the high sea wide, the seagull flies over.
It took him a few days to walk around and quietly returned to the city to see Xiang, then to the place where he first crossed the sea and landed.
The docks are still busy, with all kinds of goods unloaded from fishing boats, and also with long-distance sailing boats by the shore.
After questioning people everywhere, Miao and Zhu Tian left once again.
After a few days of touring, there was a number of things in the mind of the eastern city, the two of them came out of the dock, and smiled, "The Shun Shun is a good city lord, it seems not to have to change people.
Zhu immediately accepted: "The master is wise!"
................................................................................................... 
They were riding along the coast. They had been on the island for ten years. They had a good understanding of the sea.
Arriving at a rocky area, two stop, Seung Yi turned down the horse, flew over the rock to look around the terrain.
Zhu came near him and asked,What is the master looking at?
"I've heard there's a seafarer that can go far without a man," he said.
"Yes."
"It's not going to work for the monks who can fly above the Red Lotus," he explained.
Is it difficult to build
"It's not difficult," he said. "It's nothing different from the appearance of a normal seafarer," he said. "It's that the stern has more propeller blades made by craftsmen, that the propellers are connected to drive the front, that the propellers can be driven on condition, and that the horsepower of the legs can be driven on condition by running on the wheels of the stern, and that the speed is much faster than the speed of a normal power ship.
What are you asking for?
Say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zhu clapped: The master is wise!
"I-"You don't ask what I want to do, just say,"I'm smart.
But if you think there's really no common language with this guy, it's lazy to say anything about the cow's drums, and the silver gun flashed on the reef, stamped, waved, "I've been out for a few days, I've got to see it, I've got to see it, go back!
CHAPTER 83
As it was seen, the prince was very careful of the same gate, and the four brethren and sisters of the two of the whites were in turn guarding the mountain gate.
Today's watch is Nan, Seung Yi and Zhu Tian watch under the mountain gate board.
"Lord, you are here. Everyone is waiting for you to come."
Nan thought of the reins of the two, and went back immediately and shouted, "The master is back.
He looked at Nan, and smiled into the mountain. He didn't think that everyone would think of him, and he thought Nan Nan was making a joke.
Before the people reached the Great Hall, they saw the cave from flying, and each of them said, "The master of the cave is back.
With a handful of people entered the Great Hall, and sat down alone on the high rise, and asked, "Isn't it all right these days I've been gone?
It's all wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong
"What's going on? Everyone's not doing well.What's going on?"
Yan, calmly, said with his arm, "The lord of the cave, the next day when you went, the lord of the mountains, Qin Wei, led the people, to ask what happened to Song's death.
As soon as he mentioned the woman, a dark face.
It's not because of Song's death, it's because she's just been appointed, and the woman runs to check her back, what does that mean?
Miao looked at the people, coldly hummed: Didn't the bitch mean to get in trouble?
Ben's face was still worried, and all of them stared at him, and all of them raised their thumbs in their hearts, and the lord of the cave, your cattle, dare to be the daughter of the lord of the temple, and the lord of the mountain of the town is a bitch!
C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C
Prince Fa and others secretly exchanged eyes, it seems the relationship between the lord of the cave and the lord of Yang Qing is not as everyone imagines, it seems to be a deep resentment, even Yang Qing's daughter has cursed the bitch, the relationship can be seen how.
Many of the people who joined Yang's command, many of whom came with tasks, it is not possible to really listen to Yang, the people who were seized by the sleight of hand, and feared how to fool the master, now it seems that the master of the sleight of hand can secretly seek to come to the side of the Blue Temple, if he can turn Yang Yang's family letter into the Blue Temple hanging on the dark pillar beside Yang, the master side of the Temple can also exchange, it is not certain or a work.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
What's the big thing, as long as you can control the mouth of the Blue Gate, as long as the facts let Qin Wei know what's going to happen? He doesn't believe Yang Qing just lifted himself up, turns back and gives himself away because of the thing, doesn't it not blow his face, say he doesn't know people?
He didn't believe that Yang could do anything to damage his lord's reputation, and said, Didn't he do anything wrong?
"You don't want to say anything," said Mr.
"We're keeping our mouths like bottles, but the key is that the word is taken away by the lord of the mountain, and he doesn't know if the word can get over.
"You don't have to worry about this. I'm sure that's not what you're talking about.
He didn't say anything in his heart, to kill Song Fu has a single meaning, a single meaning can easily open to doubt.
In fact, seemingly more calm Yan and Cheu Shao group also think like this.
As soon as the sounded, there was a sneaking sound of wolf's feet.
They waited a little, and when they saw what had just been said, they hurried into the palace, and bowed their hands to the people with a trembling spirit, and then went in and said, "Lord of the cave!"
Without waiting for the word, the people had passed by, asking with seven mouths and eight tongues whether he had been taken away by the lord of the mountains.
With Yang's words at the end, the simple meaning is to take the chest to ensure that you absolutely do not sell to everyone.
With this, all at once great breath, each clapping his shoulder, saying that he is enough.
Gao sits on the sleek listens to the word is also glad, raised the throat, in the heart of glory, the east come to the end of my control!
Don't all be happy too early, don't you know Zheng Jin?
"Of course," said the Prince, "he is our brother, and he entered the school earlier than the brother of Song."
Everybody wondered why he had to mention Chenglong, and simply pointed out to the outside: "He is with me, and now he is waiting outside for the summons of the Lord of the Caverns!"
When all of them felt strange, the Prince immediately asked,Why is the Master Cheng here?
"Although I had enough of the interrogation, I gave you blue jade over the table, as if one of your masters, who was in charge of coordinating the residence of Nan Xuan, had spoken to the lord himself, saying that Song had no right to die, and asked the lord to agree to send another blue jade over Song's shortage, so that he could redeem his sins, and Zheng Jinlong came with me.
Gentlemen, it seems to you that is a matter of doubt. On the way, Zheng Jinlong knocked on my side, and said, It is better for all of you to have a heart.
Afterwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gao, who sits above, nodded, and asked the people, How do you see this?
After everyone's eyes exchanged, Prince Fa's face grimly said: "The master of the cave, the brother Zheng came only to fear that it is the same as the expression said, is aimed at the death of the brother Song.
"Your Blue Gate people are not finished, and they are looking for our truth, and if he is not faithful, you come together, and do to him, and we are not afraid of him.
Yes, what did he do?
Their faces were changed, and the Prince made a gesture: No, Lord, if we kill the Master Cheng again, the trouble will be great.
Zheng is easy to kill, but what after the death of Zheng? What shall we do if every one of the gates sends another disciple who has been trained by Qing Lin?
As the so-called bystanders, Yan, and Cheu Shao group, look at one another, the spirit of a slight twitch, the master of the cave is in the business of killing the disciples of the disciple of the disciple of the disciple of the disciple of the disciple of the disciple of the disciple.
CHAPTER 84
"You can't go left," said Mr.
Prince Fa took a fist and said, Master, I have a way of bringing Master Cheng into our camp, but I need Master to do for me one thing.
Is This Is Is Is Is Is Is This Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is Is
The Lord, if the Lord, in the allocation of the wishes, can make the Master enjoy the same treatment as we, there is a way to persuade the Master Master.
Many people frown and quickly observed the shy reaction, because this requirement is a little excessive, all the wishes pearl divided by one, there would have been three left to the master of the cave, if there were three more to Zheng Jinlong, then the master of the cave is not one no?
Indeed, hesit, and leaned a little forward, Are you kidding, Prince, that I, the lord of the cave, am not dead when you have taken away all the wishes?
I tell you, at the end of the year, twenty-four wishes for the wishes of the wishes of the wishes of the wishes of the wishes of the wishes of the wishes of the wishes of the wishes.
You,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He's not afraid of anything. He's not afraid of anything. He's not afraid of anything. He's not afraid of anything. He's afraid of anything.
"Don't misunderstand me," said the prince.
"What do you mean?"
Everybody looked at the Prince tried to ask: "Isn't the Lord saying that there is another source of wishful beads? I mean, that when the other sources of wishful beads have been found in the hands of some of my brothers and sisters, the Lord will not be too late for them to be repaired."
As soon as this came to pass, the merchants came again, and the faces of the three kings changed suddenly, not to say, that they were not able to fit into the three masters' brothers, the masters and sisters of the two masters' brothers and sisters of the three masters' brothers and sisters.
Most importantly, the master's so-called wish beads other sources are only on the mouth, everyone has never seen, it is natural to get the benefits of the hand first to get the hand is the most stable, the next thing to say is clear.
But all the princes opened their mouths, and they could not, neither could they, put it in their hearts.
Nancy was outside guarding the mountains without knowing what was going on inside the palace, or she would have been unhappy.
That's it!Your fingers whipped against his arm, and he thought for a while, then he pointed to his head, "You can promise, but when it's time to make other money, you can't shrink, you have to go with me!
Yan's heart suddenly, what flashed in his mind, the master of the cave doesn't really want to hunt the starry sea?
"It's natural," said the prince, "I'll follow the master's orders as long as I'm here."
He didn't say he's dead, but if you're the cave master, we're going to follow you!
He smiled and looked at the other disciples of the Blue Temple.
Prince Fa looked back coldly at the masters and sisters, waiting for victory and others, though some reluctant, but still extruded a smile nod.
"All right," said Mia, clapping his hand, "it's all set, and that thing, Cheng-long, will be handed over to you at the same door to deal with.
Just let him in!
Simplicity took off, soon brought from outside a white fat blue man, always with a gentle smile, looked younger than Song.
The Prince and others shouted the voice brother.
Their arches indicated a circle, finally settled, smiling at the high rise, said: "My subordinate Zheng Jinlong ordered to come east to the cave, see the master of the cave!"
This man looks more than Song's morality, at least to make Seung-yi look not so reluctant, and reach out to help, "don't be too polite."
When asked a few questions, Zheng Jinlong has always maintained a respectful attitude and kept to his subordinates.
After a long conversation, as the people were leaving the hall of the parliament, Miaoyi suddenly said, "It is plain.
When he came to the door, he turned around and said, What does the lord of the cave say?
Slowly walking down the seat, Mia looked at him like laughing and laughing, "I really didn't say anything, bitch
So did the lord leave you?
One's heart, Thinking I didn't show any blossoms, a look of surprise: Killing Song is part of the subordinate, the subordinate says nothing good to the subordinate, is the master doubting the subordinate?
"No," he said. ""No," he said. """No,"""No,"""No,"""no,"""no,"""no,"""no,"""no,"""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,""no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"no,"
In the backyard, eating full of black charcoal and not even active, still lying on the side of the door, rolling the snake's tail, swiftly entered the yard, it also just opened eyes to see, safe, not the woman with the knife on her ass, continue to nap.
Yan, who followed, tried to ask: "Lord, do you doubt the singularity of telling the truth?"
"No, I just think that bitch of Qin Wei won't talk so well, but that bitch has been looking for me.
Miao raised his hand, saying nothing.
Hearing the master came back, he looked at the thousands and the snow behind the two men.
As soon as he entered the room, the two waitresses immediately served the candy, and then silently stood around.
Miaoyi looked at the two, waved back to the two, he can't talk about any trust at the moment.
After the two went out, Mei said to Yan Shu: "I have a place by the sea, you go back to the east town, organize some workers..."
As soon as he spoke of the construction of the dock and the ship, Yan jumped at him with a sense of surprise: "Do you not really want to go hunting for the starships?
"You want more," he said. "I'll do it."
"Re-"
There is no shortage of civil servants, and that is what you have to do. I have been running for a few days, and I am going to wash and wash.
Yan, with only his shoulder, turned out of the hall, saw the thousands and the snow outside, and said with his mouth: "The cave is mainly bathing.
As he washed himself, he paused, reminding him, "All the east of the city, there is no chance of being a cave master's maid, and there is no chance of being a cave master's trusted maid, and there is no chance of staying for long..."
CHAPTER 85
The quiet young man just took off his clothes and buried them in thermal pools. He closed his eyes and enjoyed for a while. He heard the footsteps and opened his eyes to the stone room door.
As it turned out, anxious thousands and snow came in, both of them except for their clothes, only one chest on top, and a cage-sized short on the bottom.
Their shiny shoulders, their delicate claws, and their coriander-like limbs, their curved waist, were all exposed to the air.
Like two girls with shameful bones, dressed in scarce clothing, with red faces, carrying bath supplies came.
He opened his mouth, he was silent for a moment, and suddenly he thought of something, and his face was red, and he quickly reached for a garment on the shore, and pressed directly into the water to cover his throat, and he was nervous, and said, What are you two doing in here?
"Wait for the Lord's bath!" said the two men, with their faces red.
Miao tightly covered her lower body, and shook her head, No, I come myself.
This is what the slaves should do.
The two waitresses, remembering what had been said before, with their heads pressed down, stretched out their white legs to the bottom of the pond, and no matter whether Miaoyi agreed or disagreed, one reached out to help Miaoyi loose her hair, and one with a spoon to help Miaoyi wet her shoulders.
Mia is really embarrasment can not, even a little embarrasment to anger, however, some things are male nature.
The two girls had a little water, a light, half-transparent short dress, how to resist the wind of the spring water, if the water penetrated, and there was the body scent, so that the quickness of the heart instantly accelerated, did not dare to look further, to blow the two to the mouth and to swallow.
But hes not to look at the two want to hide the body, only to close the eyes, the hands tightened the panties, let the two gentle touch the body, the finger pointed over the skin feeling, let the feeling of uncontrollable a shiver.
However, gradually adapted, after adapting to feel unspeakable comfort, is that the two hands tightly cover the crotch always refuse to release.
Knowing that is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thermal Environment on thermal side of the town is not too bad.
Blue Mountains like dreams, between mountains stone tracks, there are flying birds and beasts, a group of people, turning wonders, viewing the forest sea, listening to the spring water.
A group of brothers and sisters, such as the Prince, led the brother Zheng to admire the scenery of Dong Dong, familiar with the environment of Dong Dong, each to respect the brother.
"The six holy places under its jurisdiction, and the heavens and the earth, and it is a good place!"
Several people entered into a pavilion, listening to the teacher introduced Zheng Jinlong around the beauty of the heart feeling that the mountain scene of the district to the east of the cave is not any better than the Hall Blue Temple.
There was always a gentle smile on his face.
The Prince, accompanied by a smile, "Now I have the Blue Gate, too, and there is much to be done!
"Oh," said Chenglong, "do you have a teacher in your eyes?"
As soon as this was said, the smiles on the faces of all suddenly, the atmosphere suddenly became embarrasment, the thought that should come at last.
"It scares me," he said.
Before Prince Fan's words were finished, Zheng Jin-hongren turned and interrupted, still smiling, but in the tone of Morson's coldness, "Are you afraid? Don't you think your courage is too great?
All the others' eyes fell on Prince's face, because he said there was a way.
Prince Faw looked surprised: How do you say this?
Zheng grinned,Teacher, are you fooling me?Teacher Song's death, are you not prepared to give the teacher a turn?
Prince Fa looked quietly and said: "Song master almost ruined my blue jade good, Song should die! give us another chance, we will still do it!"
After a moment, Zheng said slowly, "Is there anything in there? Is there anyone who wishes to hear it?"
Prince Fa said in a low voice, Master, there are things that even if the Master does not say, in fact, everyone knows well, can I stay under the blue jade master, and will sooner or later take Yang Qing in place, said the Master or not?
Zheng asked whether it had anything to do with Song's brother's death.
Of course there is.
Prince Fan asked: "What do you think of this young man?"
Zheng Jin-don't quite understand what it means, hesitated, "The others don't know, but they know how to be low, and they can't get on the stage, and without Yang Qing, without today, it's not enough to say that Yang Qing's heart is not enough.
"Good-bye," said the Prince, "as the Master said, but the Master knows only one thing or two, the relationship between the Young and Yang Qian is not so close as the outsider can see, I waited for him to say something wrong, and to call Qin Wei a bitch!"
Zheng Jinlong naturally knows that Qin Wei is Yang's daughter, Mia Yi dare to curse the lord's daughter is a bitch?How strange is it?But what does this have to do with the death of Song's brother?
At once the Prince had his mouth on his ear, and he whispered a few words after he had altered the facts to a lesser extent.
"Three," said Zheng, "why did he give us so many wishes?"
"I'll see with my own eyes," he said, "when I see with my own eyes a wishful bead of wishfulness that gathers all the people a year."
"What else does he wish for the Pearl?"
"Now, brother, if you know our difficulties, and if you don't listen to me," said the Prince, "you are in a higher position than we are, but once the news has come to you, the little eastern cave will be hot, and the masters will surely send their own letters to our relatives to replace us.
Our loss is a small thing, but if the news is exposed, once Miaoyi is called back by Yang Qing, do we not want to lose the pain of finding the way to the master's school, so Song should die!
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
There were so many benefits, he himself wasted, and the disciples told themselves that they wanted to share a cup with everyone.
However, this has raised doubts about the Master, or else he will not send himself, said Cheng Jinlong, frowning, "Teachers, I can understand your bitterness for the Master Master, but you know that it is not possible to give the Master a reasonable explanation, what to teach me?"
CHAPTER 86
Prince Far, knowing that he was moved, was delighted, but on the surface he wondered, Did not the Master understand what I had said before?
Zheng Jianglong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's a lot to do with my Blue Gate, if you can turn Yang's heart into a dark pile that we'll put in Yang's neighborhood...
The Master thus explains the above to ease the doubt of the Master.
Zheng Kim Long paused and said that was what he wanted to do, but that was to become a grass on a rope, and that if something happened, they would not be able to jump, nor would they be able to run themselves.
After returning to his own training home, Zheng Jinlong hesitated and corrected, on the one hand the fearful consequence of angry masters, on the other hand the huge temptation of interests.
However, after a few days of observation and consideration, coupled with the prince and others continuing to encourage the temptation, Zheng Jinlong hardly wrote a secret play.
Theory also gives examples of a bunch of songs by the singer, saying that the singer should die no matter what the current situation.
However, after Sung's death, Prince Fa and others were very angry, and almost didn't tolerate a fight with S S.
However, inadvertently discovering that Mia was only on the surface courtesy of Yang Qing, in fact he was very dissatisfied with Yang Qing, and even on the back accused Yang Qing's working daughter of being a bitch.
Prince Fa and others are thinking for the big thing, and think that Blue玉门 and Yang Qing is not yet for a Song Roofing face, since Song Roofing is dead, can not be recovered, rather to the advantage, so Prince Fa and others decide to hold on to the matter, first to keep苗毅, to give苗毅 gratitude, strive to develop the heart of苗毅 as an embedded in the dark pile around Yang Qing, to wait for Blue Blue玉门 useful.
Moreover, it is easy to control, controlling苗毅 is equal to controlling Dong Dong, if for this to make苗毅 out Dong Dong, once Yang Qing sent a higher person to control, it is really inconvenient to Blue玉门 controlling Dong Dong.
Finally, Zheng said, He also thinks that the Prince and others are really good heart and suffering, please the masters to take into consideration!
In the court, Zheng Jin Long still a bit hesitant, wandering uncertain.
Finally a bite, throwing the eagle in hand into the air.
Fly away quickly..
As the saying goes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although hesit to control himself did not break that bottom line, after all the two were intimate skin in the most private circumstances, the first time with a woman so intimate, after all the feelings of the two have been different, the underlying consciousness of the two as their own, to wake up is also more casual.
Chi and Snow will no longer be so anxious in the face of the master of the cave, even remembering the first time the master of the cave washed, the master of the cave is even more shy and nervous than them, and the fairy is also shy!
Yan, who entered the back of the eastern palace, smiled, only to see in the pavilion, the snow ten fingers to the violin, in the beautiful sound of the violin, the thousands dancing, dancing beautifully as the fairy, and the Miaoyi squeezed a cup of tea to admire, the little days have been good.
Seeing Yan came in, Mia waved, thousand and snow stop.
Yan, walking into the pavilion, glanced at the two, and laughed, and asked, Master of the cave, these two can be used with satisfaction, and if not, I will let the master of the east town replace them with two.
Or for the reasons of the believer, Others may not be treated so well, once chosen, can not be replaced by, nor can any monk take all the women of the world as his own women of any use, if it is so, is it not for the world to revolt, but the master of the cave is a little special treatment.
It is only those under the Six Saints can enjoy the treatment of the maid of dress, and the monks outside the system can not enjoy the treatment, and the other monks go to the blue building is no problem, if they dare to attack the believers to destroy the balance of the believers to see, the monks within the system will mobilize horses to chase and kill, they will maintain their privileges!
This is one of the reasons why everyone wants to enter the system.
As soon as Yan said this, the thousands and the snow suddenly looked nervously at the young.
Before they were going to be the attendants of the fairies, the city of the east had spent a great deal of heart and blood to educate them, to eat and drink, and no one dare to sin them, because they were going to be the attendants of the fairies, sins are likely to be recompensed.
But if they were driven back, they would have fallen directly from heaven to the earth, without a fairy's background, and no one would have regarded them afterwards, and the consequences of being driven back would have been known, and it would certainly have been without a good fairy's service, and it would have been natural for some bloody people to be angry.
The two ladies looked at their eyes, thought of the condition of the skin in the water, and coughed, "Okay, with the hand, do not change.
He didn't want to be exposed to the embarrasment of bathing himself.
This means that the two ladies have passed the probation period, have been formally recognized, and their identity has changed instantly, and they have become officially the peers of the master of the cave, and no one can be guilty, even Yan Shu immediately faces the two ladies and says: "Aunt, Aunt!"
Even the fairies glorified themselves, and the two ladies saw with astonishment that the lord of the cave had officially acknowledged the two of them, and that from then on their status would be higher than that of many others, at least of those who were chosen together to serve the fairies as the fairies, for the two were the fairies of the lord of the cave.
Before the two didn't know that was the master of the cave. It's not anybody's luck, at least two out of 100,000.
Their eyes were different, and the two gently moved, and stood behind them.
Neither avoided the two, knowing that once the two were chosen, would start to let the two contact things, later would do things for themselves as Qingmei and Qingqiu for Yang, otherwise nothing can do anything.
"Do you have any reactions over there?" asked Zheng.
"There is no reaction at the moment, Zheng Jinlong has lived in his residence not out, Prince Fa they are very anxious, in constant urgency," Yan said.
CHAPTER 87
Just as the two were discussing, Zheng Jinlong, who was wandering in the yard and waiting for the news, paused, looked at the darkness that was passing through the air, and stretched out his arms to welcome.
After two days of flying, the flying eagles finally returned, and the cry fell on his arm.
Immediately a narrow jade was taken out of the eagle's tube for inspection.
Only see above written: Prince Law and others care and suffering, to cooperate!
This was the reply of the Blue Gate, Zheng Jinlong suddenly relaxed his mouth, did not know the attitude inside the gate, he did not dare to appear to the prince and others, betrayed himself, afraid to be caught up in the time, if the Blue Blue Golden Gate Gate had to seek the end, not he could not stop.
With the master's door passed, Zheng Jinlong also had confidence, quickly put the eagle into the eagle nest, turned back into the house, took off his blue coat, and changed into a black suit.
The Lord of East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East East
Waiting for the black cloaked Zheng Jinlong to go out of the door, Prince Fa and others do not know where to flash out, and again in the old tone: "Teacher, what do you think?
They're worried too, if Zheng don't really cooperate, then they can only listen to sleek, join hands to get Zheng done.
Even though they knew that would be enough to stop their thirst, they could not do it.
"Because of your love for the school, I'm going to hang my head for you this time," said Zheng Jinlong, handing over the secret letter that he had just received to several people.
After a few had a look at the force in turn, one after the other was delighted, and at the indication of the prince, several stood in a line, and Qi arched hands, "There is a labourer brother!"
"I haven't seen the master for a few days, and I don't know if the the master has anything to send!"
After saying this, everyone knows that he has decided to share a cup, which is to let the master of the cave rest.
All of them immediately.
Themmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Tell them to come in!
Just after Yan Shu had spoken to the two ladies, the little aunt's snow with a little shaking, immediately walked to the door of the great hall, and summoned courage to the people who waited under the high stairs outside, "The master has asked you to enter the great hall.
His voice is not small, but it is clear that his voice is shaking, and it is clear that he is nervous, and it is understandable that he is so powerful for the first time in the face of a group of fairies.
When Zheng and others entered the Great Hall, Seong Yi saw the black clothes on him, understood that is Zheng Jin Long's attitude, smiled in his eyes, knowing that the man was also drawn to the water.
He looked at Prince, and immediately said to the voice, I've done it!
"Come to see the Lord!"
After all, the next person is ready to fight no one is afraid, to touch the four cloths of the monk can do one thing, Miaoyi smiled, "No more polite!
The Thous and The Snow sneaked a glance, and found that the master was a good man, and that so many fairies listened to him alone.In fact, there were nine below, plus one outside who guarded the mountain gate, and there were ten under, too many of whom could not afford to enter the cave.
But for the first two ladies, even one of the fairies was high in their minds, and more than ten, they had never seen so many fairies who had to be admired suddenly appear before them.
They don't know what to do if they know that their master is the worst of all the fairies.
After nine men stood in two rows, Zheng Jinlong once again went out to the arch and said: "When Zheng Jinlong came first, he hadn't done much for the east, and I don't know if the lord of the cave can send."
It's about showing you're willing to listen to the dispatch.
"The newcomer always has to show," said Mia with a smile. "How about a day at the mountain gate?"
After a while, let a monk, who had been made of three white roses, look at the gate, and come to this set again? Did not the lord of the cave, who had not yet understood the meaning, want to put a poison on Zheng Jinlong?
Zheng Jinlong also jumped, he was only the surface attitude, didn't think the other actually come, but thought that the person in the sight, although low, but the ability to kill the three monasteries of the White Lotus.
But soon I saw the master's intention is to see whether he really willing to accept the dispatch, people don't believe what is said, to put themselves into actual action to express.
"Do your duty," said Cheng.
Let's go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'll introduce you as soon as the people are almost there."
He lifted his fingers to the waiter, This is a thousand, This is a snow!
After everyone looked at each other, each holding a fist, "I have seen a great aunt, I have seen a little aunt!"
Chi and Snow in the tension of the two missing.
After a brief exchange of positions, Zheng Jinlong went to the mountain gates, and was alarmed by the right to guard the mountain gates of Wang Xiuchen, who dare to guard the mountain gates.
Hearing that was the meaning of the lord of the mountains, Wang Hidegan was able to let go, but in a low voice reminded: "Teacher, Song Teacher thing you know, too be careful.
Zheng nodded, on the surface, but in fact the heart tightened, or a little worried that the master of the cave will play.
Song-the last time the mountain gate was knocked, everyone is not stupid, after all, it is guessed that苗 is behind playing, in seeking excuses to jump.
So Zheng Jin decided today to protect the mountain gate and not to go, so as not to turn the boat in the ditch...
The news of Zheng Jinlong's humble surrender soon passed to Zhenhaishan, Qin Wei in a white suit like snow lying on a couch, looking at the secrets in his hand, a taste of thirst, the guy sent the Blue Gate to investigators to get it done, is the Blue Gate waste?
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
The Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue
Anyone who wants to find out the truth is true, but Yang agreed on the spot.
Afterwards Qin Wei asked Yang why agreed, what if to find out the truth?
Yang said, look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look look
Thes soon moved to the South.
Or in the mountain pavilion, Yang, who got the secret, laughed, "One more fold in, this little boy is really to the east of the cave to operate into the bottomless cave, come one to swallow one!
A glance at the other side, the little boy again did not disappoint the lord, see the lord is more and more admiring him, the key is that the guy all the blue door fit the lord's appetite.
CHAPTER Eighty-eight Incubated Pluto Eggs (1)
Certainly Zheng Long's affair, Blue Gate is waiting to be handled, for the time being no concern, Mia finally can concentrate on the refinement.
But before that he had one more thing to do, which was to get to the bottom of the hole, to get to the bottom of the hole, and there was no time, and now there was time, and the last time that he had been with Old White in the red dust, he was going to try it out, as Old White said.
One day, just when it was dawning, Miao said to keep the thousands and the snow outside and not to let anyone in to disturb, and one hid in the quiet room to prepare, it was not possible, because the old man said that this secret must not be passed on!
As soon as the bulk of the eggs came out, the temperature in the room seemed to have fallen a little, the eggs in the hand were like holding the ice.
Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia Mia
Carefully remove one of the eggs from the membrane, and place one hundred black eggs the size of quails on a plate.
Again, I felt a small knife in my hand, the blade was in my left hand, my right hand grasped the handle, and my left hand hand was bloody.
Old White told him to cover each egg with his own blood, to cover the egg with his own blood, and not to have any blanks, to separate the sex from the sex, and to let the egg in the place of birth feel his full breath.
After making every egg black, carefully confirming that there was no mistake, spread out the bound hair braid, hardened the hair from the head.
This is the secret of the old and the new, that the hair must be complete, not cut, and that the hair must have roots, and that the roots must not be cut, since they are to hatch.
This pull is a hundred, after careful screening, a dozen hairs without roots are useless, and repeatedly pull from the head a few times, until it is full of a hundred hairs with roots intact.
A hundred hairs were infected with blood in the left hand, and a hundred hairss were held together in the hand.
At once, a hundred long hairs were formed like a cow's hair, like a hedgehog.
He held a hundred long hairs on the top of the dish, and arranged each of the eggs in the dish, and stuck them directly down.
Their skin was not hard, but exceptionally tough and soft, and it took a long time to stab a hundred roots with bloody hair into the skin of their eggs, and into the eggs.
This practice is known as the Yin Yang Line.
Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y
And that's why he's pulling his hair and bleeding himself, is to expect one day to be able to control that kind of fear mantis.
Although he didn't know how powerful the mantis was, even after becoming a monk, he felt that he had no power of retaliation against the mantis.
Almost at the moment when hundreds of hairs were inserted into the pit, the hundreds of hairs were quickly transmitted into the bones of cold, not pure cold, but the kind of feeling as if there had been a false sensation, as if there had been a moment in the pit where the souls were shivering.
This strange feeling put Mia in a state of spiritual ecstasy, gradually, my soul seems to float around in the eternal darkness!
In contrast to ordinary people, this situation means that the soul is not keeping, it means that there is a big problem.
Fortunately, the 'Star's Secret', which he learned, played an enormous role in the critical moment, when the body's hard-worked method was under the influence of the cold, and immediately moved itself in a relentless manner, a warmth quickly expanded to the whole body, and the cold power was swept out of the body instantly, and the suprema.
Miao Yi shivered, woke up quickly from the confusion of his mind, and found immediately that the hundred long faces had frozen in ice.
"My dear," said hes, "these plum eggs are so strange that they make me lose my heart!"
He's expecting what this thing will be like when it hatches.
After setting his mind, carefully recalling the old and the new, the five fingers grasped a hundred long hairs, began silently to guide the power of the hundred long hairs into the hundred dark eggs, to the secret method for it.
In less than half an hour, Mia opened her eyes, took the force, and grasped the hand of a hundred long hairs also relaxed.
Under his work, he had a hundred long hairs melted, and quickly spread out from the roots of the ice pack.
He doesn't know if it's going to be useful.
Turning his palm out of the sack, he drew his lips out of the sack and blew a little cloud of stars to the cut of his left hand. Only the blurred cut of his blood and flesh was healed immediately and at a visible speed.
After returning to the first, Mia looked at the plant in hand without shaking her head, it was really lucky, then the mantis was hanging out from the red dust of the star, if not the plant, to hatch the mantis egg afraid of some trouble.
There is no reason, because according to the secret of the old white doctrine, the Pluto eggs every day to fill the whole body with their fresh blood, it is 98 days, this 98 days, no day can be separated, otherwise you have to give up before.
In other words,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
He washed the blood of his hands in the flowing hot spring.
There was some curiosity among the thousands and the snows that saw what was in her hand. What was in the white, black, and red dish?
Whatever it is, Snow has taken the initiative to help him.
It may be now that they are accustomed to calling, and handed it to her, and was about to say two words, but found Snow's face instantly pale, shivering at the end of the plate, the plate slipped from her hand involuntarily.
Fortunately, Mia reacted quickly, one dragged the plate, and another caught the distorted falling snow arm.
He also responded by neglecting himself, that which was in the dish was very heavy, and that which the common man could not bear.
However, his refined technique was very effective in suppressing the intoxication, and quickly passed into the body of Snow, which would sweep away the intoxication in her body instantly.
The snow that turned white finally came to rest, but had been injured in a moment by the wind, and the man who stood there was still a little empty, and his face was still pale.
CHAPTER 89
"I'm sorry, but you're all people, and you can't touch this thing.
"Are you all right, Snow?"
Thous and Snow looked at the plate, which was untouchable to all.
Snow shook his head and apologized quickly, "It's the slave's fault.
"It's all right," said Mia with a smile. "It's all right," she said.
The two went out of the hall behind him, only to see that the outside was already sunny, and when the thing in the dish saw the sun, the condensed ice cream hair immediately emerged a plume of black smoke, the frost white disappeared, instantly restored the hair's original color.
It is not possible to see the sun melt so fast, it is not possible to smoke.
It is clear that ice covering hair is not a natural ice, but is manifested by a very dark air.
The ice suddenly turned black smoke into hair again made the thousands and the snow, because did not feel the fairy's fairy, instead felt a evil spirit.
Suddenly the black coal, which was lying on the side of the door, sneezed, and lifted his head and opened his eyes, and looked at the thing in his hand, and seemed to feel something.
Nevertheless, as soon as he saw Miao taking the two waitresses to the'starboard', he had nothing to do with himself, and continued to fall asleep, and lazy was lazy.
Thermal Observatory is a high platform that is easy to look at the stars, Thermal Observatory's sleight of hand puts the disk on the ground, the play according to the old saying once it starts, before it hatches, can not let it touch the ground, to be separated from the ground, put on the Thermal Observatory.
Under the sun squatted and watched for a while, the wind blowing a root of hair planted on the Pluto egg, and did not know that the old saying that Pluto was gradually acquainted with and accustomed to this root of hair was false.
"A Thousand, Snow!"
"Here," said the two ladies.
"From now on," said Mr. Seong, pointing at what was on the plate, "I am going to shut down the process, and you two keep the current under the observatory, and do not let anybody come up and touch it, nor do you let it touch the ground under the observatory.
Every day before the sun, or when it rains and you can't see the sun, remember to come and call me in the quiet, and every day before the sun rises, you must come and call me in the quiet.
"I've got it down," said the two ladies.
The Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Five Five Five Five Five Five Five Five Five Five Five Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten
The two nodded again.
"Sew me a coat..." She began by drawing a pattern of a cloth bag for them to sew.
When the two ladies understood what they were saying, they quickly went to get the yarn, and when they came back, they sat by a side and cut the cloth.
Just then, Yan entered the yard, found苗 Yi, said that had contact with the east side of the city, the dock and the ship's construction will begin the same day.
Don't lose the worker's money.
Miao gave an order.
It was not the first time that had been mentioned, and Yan said that he would take care of it, and after he had noticed Snow's face, he asked without hesitation, "Aunt's face doesn't seem so good, is she sick?"
Snow shook his head, remembering the feeling before, still with a heartache.
Seung Yi looked back at Snow still some dark face, know that just hurt the spirit, there is no big problem.
"I'm looking for you two," he said.
Yan asked, "I don't know what the master tells me?"
Didn't both of them have training qualifications?
As soon as this came out, Yan had guessed what Yu was going to say, "But the Master is going to let them both practice?"
Chi and Snow immediately looked quietly, after all it was not the first day, these days constantly hear the people often talk about the refinement, how little and how little know what it means, not by careful heart tightened, little ears raised.
"Yes," said Seung.
That's what he was going to do, and he felt that there was nothing that could be done by the two weak women around him, especially for the practitioners, who were a bit of a problem for him, to go back to the mountains and to invite people to see him, to go for a long time, to climb the mountains, to lie back and forth, to be exhausted, to change the colour of the flower, to go for a long time is not the way to go.
Like Yang, there are two trained waitresses, to do everything is more convenient, and also can be used as a guard.
Especially when he saw snow hit the ball, it almost happened to him to put the thing formally on his mind.
"Where can I get the tricks for the two of them?"
After a moment of reflection, Yan said, "The complete practice is the root of life passed down by the different sects, and is not to be passed down, and in order to control the disciples, it is also to be passed down in stages, and I am afraid it is difficult to get to.
If you have the opportunity to the sea of clouds, there are three no matter the area, the six holy places without a foothold is also mostly in the place, the demons mixed, some do black eating things is normal, but it is possible to buy a lot of money, but without the refined work method no one can guarantee that the purchase is complete, if it is not done well can practice to fire into the devil.
After all, most monks tend to memorize the Dharma in their minds, and even if they are carrying with them, they will do things only by their own understanding, and avoid the exhalation of the Dharma.
"The sea of clouds..."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
"It's too far," she shook her head, "and who's going to risk it anyway, and it's not as safe as you say, is there no other way?"
Yan shook his head, "It's hard! To suppress the number of monks in the world, it's harsh to deal with this private selling of practices!
He didn't say who was suppressing, but when he heard it, he knew it was the Sixth. The Sixth didn't want to see too many people sharing the power of the candle in the world. Once the monks were overwhelmed, everyone wanted to have the power of the candle, there would be turmoil, there would be serious threat to the existing rules, and the Sixth would not allow anyone to threaten them.
He asked with a frown, "Where is the master's maid?"
"It is natural for the lord to teach his own practices, usually should be like this.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a good thing to say, in fact the idea is to make Miao, like other sects, to teach a little bit in stages, so that can also control two waitresses.
CHAPTER 189
There was a moment when the heart was moved and sad.
It's...don't move.
As soon as the body moves, the brain also starts to move, how could he be so wise as not to know that Vivian was dead.
He refused to admit, nor to think deeply, only to force himself to sit like this, to convince himself that she was just asleep, that she would wake up.
Little Splash felt that only when White's body began to rot, would the governor really get back to reason, knowing that the man he was holding had been dead for a long time.
But it's strange that's not what happened to her body.
Even her pale face was much better, although the body is cold, but sleep with no doubt.
There were no signs of the body.
Her eyes were brighter.
Therapist's old head was finally pushed, and he took therapist's pills. "I've lost most of my life," he said.
Murgon hasn't slept for five days, and anyone can see how tired he is.
But the whole man was awfully awake, awfully awake.
"She's sleeping after she's taken her medicine, and I think you should come and see her. When does she wake up?"
Then the old man sighed, and went to the bed, and gave her the blood.
"In fact, this phenomenon is extremely rare, and there is no need for medical treatment, but there is something particularly important to be done..."
M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M
The old man's voice went down, "I'm about to treat another man..."
You're not going to miss what you said.
As a result, the old man's method is like electricity, instantly a needle is attached to his neck.
M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M
Their hands went out, and they caught the attack of Mon Mon.
Once in a while, Mr. Murgon has not been able to sleep.
Bad old man touch his head, "I almost died, but I guess I won't live for long, he wakes up not crazy even good. "
She's not coming back.
And the state of Ming is a sadness in the heart of the gods, and the five bowels of the gods, and the six bowels of the gods.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
"You are protecting the life of my lord, and this time if you are not protecting, I will kill you."
When she had finished, she turned and went to the place where they were executed, and was silently punished.
"It's no wonder my master says that selling fries can't be a god, that everyone has made me a god, that God can't make a man who wants to die live."
M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M
He wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'll give you a needle," said the old man when he woke up. "You're going to die, but you're going to see Yan."
Their eyes were dim, their faces were pale, but they were full of anger, and they looked cold and cheerful.
"I didn't want to save you, after all, you're such an evil man, you're not sure what's going to happen to the world."
M M M M M M M M M M M
"No," shook the old man, "I can't help you," and "I can't help you," he said.
"You can't pay, how can you pay for a hair, even if you save everyone in the world."
CHAPTER 190 The Matters Between the Lord and the Queen (finished)
Bad Old Man: "You're not stupid, you know she's dead."
M M M M M M M M M M M M
If you look at the old man, you just need to get a few more stitches.
"Her condition is so special that you can't keep up with it, and the pharmaceuticals can't keep up with it," she said, "that's why all the pharmaceuticals protect her body, so that she doesn't rot for years, unless you burn her with fire."
"The little emperor," said the old man, with a sigh, "they took her body and burned it."
As soon as the emperor heard, he did not know the emperor's mind.
"Good, good."
He made a series of goods, laughing together, "Whoever takes her, you don't want to live one."
When he had finished, the needle burst out of his body, and blood flowed out of his wound.
Look at the old man, he knows he's back to the old man.
The Most Injured, The Most Injured.
Mogon washed away from therapist's needle and flew straight out.
As a result,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I don't live long," said the old man with a shiver, "is this guy really wicked, and he's not going to kill me, but he's going to keep torturing me?"
There is a huge pile of wood in front of the palace.
She was lying in the wood, quiet, soft, like asleep.
His eyes were red and his teeth were bleeding.
He cried with his voice: "Go after my mother."
Everyone in the palace, except Mon Mon, agreed to send Bai Wei to the road.
All those who were on this side of the emperor were afraid of their lord's madness, so they agreed to burn the emperor's hand.
It burns.
A little fat can't stand, knee down and cry.
As a result, without waiting for the fire to burn to the body of white widow, a flying dark shadow, without a deadly head stuck in the fire, to hold the body of white widow, then jump out of the pile of fire.
Little Fat looked at the man, and cried out with a great deal of resentment, "Murgen, you can't die, my mother was killed by you, but you want to touch her body, and you're not a man."
King Murgon held Vivian, and the flame burned her hair and her horns, but Vivian did not lose any.
He didn't answer, but said softly: "What a mess is that you dare to step on my head, it's time to clean the palace."
At the beginning of this sentence, Ming returned to the evil cruelty, a hand covering the nine thousand years.
The Emper wasted.
People in the house.
Especially those who admitted to burn out the body of Bai Wei, whether or not the heart of Murgon was to be killed.
Emperor Murgon refused to change, and he made the emperor a puppet, and the whole world a slaughterhouse.
Killing is his only love.
Murgon looked at the door, red.
He gently touched Vivi, in his arms, " Vivi, you see, I've killed again today, and you're asking me for forgiveness, shall I not kill?"
She's so quiet.
Murgon laughed,"If you don't speak,I'll continue to kill."
He once said that if she dared to die, he would take the people of this world down to hell and bury her.

"Why don't you give me a better chance."
Chapter 191
Therm washed over therm of the whole man as he struggled from his bed.
He shivered, and his face was unspeakable.
Suddenly he could not hold himself, biting his teeth seemed to want to call out who's name.
But there were many noises.
But they couldn't name the girl in the dream.
His heart beat fast, and he could see the sea of fire spreading out of his dream, and it would devour him at any moment.
He looked down at his hands and seemed to be holding her.
Those joys and sorrows were slowly fading, but the love that was deep in the bones, seemed to have been infected with him by the man who was called Murgon.
Huan knows he's been in trouble for some time.
And this incongruity has caused his emotions to fluctuate.
For example, now, he will feel... sad?
Is It Sad?
His chest was as painful as a hole opened, and all the instruments were checked, and his body was without any problems.
Huang thought for a long time before going to bed.
As soon as I went to bed, a servant came and said, "Doctor Qin is here."
Huang nodded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As a result, the door of his home was opened, and Qin, commander of the medical staff, handed in all the medical equipment.
Huang looked quietly, with a dark eye.
Qin, looking up at Ying, who had become accustomed to his dead face, hastened to meet him and said: "My room stay."
"Isn't your room going to stay for life?"
There were many rooms where he lived, and Qin often came, and he reserved for him a special room.
Qin: "Of course I know, so I'll use it for a while."
Huan did not speak.
Qin didn't have to ask and said: "You thought I would come and live here, you're wrong, there's a lot to do in my hospital, and there's a lot to live here."
Huan wasted no time.
Qin began to say: "I'll give my room to your wife."
Huang thought, then quietly said: "Byee?"
Qin: "Yeah, I've already sent her to the room. Mr. White doubts that there's been a lot of trouble in his house, especially when Ms. White was kidnapped in the hospital two days ago, and he feels that everyone around him can't believe, so he'll give Mrs. White to you first. aren't you her unmarried husband?"
Think for a moment,I don't have time to take care of a patient.
Qin: That's your unmarried wife.
"I'm not going to have a wife."
Qin a look of shock, "What?"
H: You can move her in anyway, you take care of yourself.
"She's not my wife."
"I gave it to you."
Qin's old blood washed out, he defeated.
Huan shouldn't have a wife,he should have been with the robot.
Qin decided not to talk to the emotional child, he needs to go quiet, no, he needs to go to white Wei arrange the environment.
After all, she is sick and sleeps, and needs special care and medical instruments to keep her alive.
Qin's hands quickly, arranged the apparatus, saw the situation steady, and then ordered the guard to stay all night.
He came out of the room, and saw that Ying had a glass of water and was sitting on the sofa in the living room, and seemed to be thinking.
Chapter 192
Qin also became thirsty, and after the servant brought water, after drinking a large mouth to say: "You are insomnia?"
"I think of something I need to think about."
Qin Qian went to the sofa opposite him, drinking water and said, "What questions need to be thought about?"
Isn't it difficult for a company to close down?
Huang said calmly: "I'm thinking, will I be J?"
Qin Autumn poured out of the mouth,"J"!
"It's in my dream, I've been dreaming about that guy, and I've been thinking about J."
Qin: Stop Stop, what strange dream have you done again?
"I dreamed she was dead, but the body was always as lovely as sleeping."
Qin Autumn weird tone," cute?"
Hue Hue Hue Hue Hue Hue Hue Hue Hue Hue Hue
Hue Hue Hue Hue Hue Hue Hue Hue Hue
Then he went on and said, "And the man in the dream, on many occasions, couldn't help but want J's corpse."

When did it start?
Looking at her dead body day after day without any response.
Or are you starting to get crazy, sick, or even twisted?
He had done all he could to stop himself, but at last he couldn't help taking off her clothes.
He felt himself alive by his cold skin.
The Killer hasn't been able to trigger any response.
She's dead.
He knows. He always knows.
He even knew how terrible the darkness of himself was that he refused to put her into the ground.
When the little emperor was six years old, he would rather burn her body than leave it to him.
Maybe he knew at the beginning that he was going to do this kind of thing to her.
Many times he really wanted to do that, but often at the last step, he looked at her quiet face, and did not go.
He's afraid she's going to get angry at him.
Even though they're already married, it's still the last step.
He didn't dare.
M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M
He washed her body thoroughly, and dressed her comfortably and beautifully, and then took her out.
The vacant palaces, The slaves fled everywhere.
When he knew that little emperor was beginning to build up power, to link up the forces of the parties, and to plan for independence, he did not stop his actions.
Sometimes even help him.
The Young Emperor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's been a decade, and he's been guarding the cold body of Vivian for a decade.
It's fast.
Mogon, holding Bai, slowly walked to the gate, and saw a young man in the shape of a lion, wearing a armor, and holding a long sword, holding the banned army in front of the palace.
The young man's face was cool, his sword pointed at the king, and said with a harsh voice, "The thief, bring my mother back, and I will give you the whole body."
Chapter 193
The emperor grew up very quickly and lived under the emperor.
Again, under this humiliation, step by step, began to fight for power and profit, and now finally can take the sword, to revenge.
M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M
His look was indescribable gentle, and then he looked up at the little emperor.
"Here again? She's always mine. Why don't you tell her again?"
The emperor washed his eyes, and said, My mother is dead, and the dead are great, and how can you, how can you not leave her body, and how can you not let her go to give birth?
Nobody knows in the palace,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When he saw so much of his private affairs, how could he not have known the filth of his mother's mind.
"You said you loved my mother, but what you did was to insult her, and your face said you loved her."
Little Emperor said here, barely crying, he hated that he had no power to protect her, and he hated that he had grown too slowly to allow her to be buried.
Murgon, looking down at the little emperor, laughed suddenly, "I deliberately, I hear, that her soul can only be trapped beside the corpse, if she does not leave a corpse to be buried."
The emperor suddenly remembered that thief had asked the temple high priests to enter the palace.
"I've asked the high priest to put down the spell of locking the soul, and if there is a soul after a man's death, she can't escape from me, she can only stay by my side day and night."
The emperor shivered, his eyes filled with blood, and he drank in anger: "Lord, do you love a man like this?
"I've been a madman, and even if she died, she wouldn't want to get away from me, and I'd like her to be with me all the time."
The Little Emper waved,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He's not going to the king. He's not going to get up.
But without waiting for any action, suddenly the flame jumped, the palace had already poured oil, a little fire plus the wind, suddenly the flame burst.
Everyone had to retreat to avoid fire.
When the emperor saw that he was standing in the fire, and that he was holding the emperor's wife, he could not stand to go into the fire at once.
The man behind embraced him at once, "Lord, you can't go in; the fire is not going out; where are you going in?"
No matter what the little emperor did, he cried to the emperor, torn to his heart, "The emperor, you let go of her, you let go of me."
This fire is not going to go out.
M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M
Hearing the words of the little emperor, the emperor lifted his eyes, and in the light of the fire, the smile, which could not be said, relaxed, even with the tear marks under his eyes.
Then he took White and turned and walked slowly into the palace full of flames.
You can't live together.
For ten years, he has been thinking about his union with her, but he has always stopped at the last step.
'Cause he knows he's dead even if he gets her body.
If there was a lifetime, she knew he was so dirty, she might not want him.
All right, dead, they can burn together, they can't separate.
Chapter 194
Murgon couldn't help holding her, and the flame began to devour their bodies.
He stared at her.
Then he put his head on her neck, and murmured softly: "I miss you, Wei."
()
Qin covering his head, he felt a headache.
What is this?
"In the end, the little emperor couldn't really separate the ashes of these two men," he continued.
Qin Qian shake hands, "I think you have a problem recently. "
Huan nodded,I know.
Qin: "You must have been bad, so start to change, even the dreams are so change. And you dream about love every day during this time, don't deny, you must have been thinking about love crazy."
Shu Shu looked at him.
Qin clapped,,What do you do these dreams?You've been, don't say, a woman, not even a few times.Which man is like you?"
"I think it's not like a dream, it's more like it's real."
Qin: "Mom, is your delusion so serious?
Huang wasting his time to convince others. He stood up and said,I'll go to the company.
Qin reached for him,,What company are you going to,I'm telling you're going to be in love,you're going to be in C,you're such an old man,I've seen so many,I think women are going crazy,you know."
Huang tried to pull his hand, but found his pull dead.
Qinqing continued: "You should go now to meet with your wife, to talk about love with her, and finally the water to the drain will be able to do some shameful things, so that you will not always do those wishful dreams."
H: Let go.
Qin: "Your boy, don't be shy, I'm here, you know, I've never talked about the pain of love..."
Hu: "You old man, let go."
Qin Autumn was like electric shock, stayed on the scene.
After defeating the enemy, he turned faceless and went to work at four in the morning.
Qin, covering his chest,"I don't want to save your future wife, nor do I want to give you a taste of loneliness."
After leaving, Qin Qi sigh, feeling that he is older than many years.
He thought of going to see White, after all, people are still sleeping.
As a result, as soon as he opened the door, he heard the guard say, Miss White, wait, this needle can't be pulled like this.
Why did she get so much? She's just trying to piss off the system.
That broken system took her life value and replaced her life for a month.
In addition to her earlier life security low, deducted five days life value.
As soon as she woke up to hear that she had lost five days of her life to the system, the heart attack occurred immediately.
To keep her from dying, the system uses life to prolong Dan, to get ten days of life, and one tap leaves five days.
There's an hour left.
Five days One hundred twenty hours, it's only one hour.
She's gonna cut the system. She's gonna say it's not the system.

The system shut down immediately.
She doesn't have any time to go into the system, and she's got an hour left to do something more important.
She went downstastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastasta
She's seen him a few times, after all, being the president of the hospital.
She said in a hurry, Hello, where is this?
When I woke up, the rooms were changed, weren't they the hospital's super vip?
Qin immediately said: "It's your unmarried husband's house, it's like that, your father wants to make you feel deeper... what do you do?"
White Wi's hands touch his clothes like hungry wolf.
When she had no time to hear what he was saying, she reached out directly from his pocket and called her father.
As soon as the phone rang, she said, Dad, the bitch in White Yao wants to kill me. I have a heart attack, she's taking my medicine, she's taking my unmarried husband, she's taking my place, she's lucky I'm not dead, and she's the last time she's said that she's going to kidnap me, she's going to drown me. You'd better get her under control, then wait for me to go back...
She paused and said slowly, "Go back and blow her a thousand and eight hundred palms, and let her wake up, and the wild chicken is not destined to be a phoenix.
The phone stopped for a long time, seeming to digest her words.
Then suddenly there was a light laugh, "Sister, I don't know what you're talking about, you've been sick for a long time, have a problem with your brain."
My heart trembled.
"What about my dad?"
"You said our father, he slept, so don't disturb him this night."
She smiled,What do you want?
"What do I want? I want you to die, don't you?"
"That's your dad, don't hurt him."
"Is he my father? "You ask yourself," said Mr. White, "in your eyes there is only one thing, and my mother is a grass." "You're doing something." "He's on fire, and I'm dead."
White went out quickly, but saw outside the room, a completely strange house, a huge hall, raised by a brilliant expensive crystal hanger.
Their servants came quietly.
The door is a special design, without the consent to open the kind.
Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey!
Only White White could think of her strange unmarried husband, as a rich man of the enemy.
"What do you want? As long as you don't hurt Dad, I'll do anything."
Although Bai Chang washed away when young, attracted to Bai Yao such a private woman.
But to Bai, Bai Chang really poured full of love.
"My sister, who always looks like the queen," said White Yao, smiling delightfully. "Why are you so low against me?
Vivian had reached the door, at the telephone, the woman voice still loud.
"Dad is bound by me by a bomb, and now I want you to choose, are you taking your own life, or are you going to die like this?"
Chapter 196
Shut your eyes and calm down.
Then she opened her eyes again.
"I chose to use my life."
When Qin came, she heard what was said.
He was like,What's going on?
White Wi turned and said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Qin realizes that's not right, he immediately let the attendant open the door, and then go to get the car.
White Wi flew up, when the door opened, pushed out Qin-and directly sat on the driver's seat, closed the door, and drove, a series of moves fast and terrible.
As soon as Qin's reaction came back, the car was exhausted.
Qin is shocked, he suddenly pulling legs to run after his car.
"Byeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeye
Without a cell phone, how does he play the King?
()
Huan's house was about an hour away from her home.
White washed away at a speed of no life when she came home.
The system reminds you have ten minutes left.
Can't she live a little longer?
What's this broken system doing to her life?
She never lived a successful day.
Mrs. White pointed directly to the door lock, the house was empty, and there was no one.
What about the usual dozen?
They've all been sent away?
Vivian's heart beats very fast, if not the life value of the system can make her physical quality greatly improve.
She thinks she'll have a heart attack.
All of a sudden White Yao appeared at the door of the stairs, "Sister, you are here."
She stared at her,,What about Dad?
White Ya looked at her gently, "Father took sleeping pills, and he was very vigilant, and if I hadn't been looking for a long time, I wouldn't have let him sleep."
"If you want me, what are you going to do? I'm going to jump on my own, or you're going to cut my face with a knife, and you're going to need a dozen more to get your breath out."
White Ya suddenly said, Don't come, sister, I am afraid of your special.
It's not dead. It's flying.
She felt absurd, but she had to defend herself.
Beaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
Vivian didn't think the system would suddenly remind her what was left of the three steps?
She chose to believe in the system for almost a moment.
White Ya's face changed, "Stop for me."
She'll be able to touch her a few more steps.
But Vivi jumped up a few steps, and the system simultaneously reminded, "Bit, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
When she was about to scream, to make Angel die, suddenly her brain was shaken, her eyes dispersed for a few seconds, until she was awakened, she had two eyes shining and looking at her.
Sister,I love love!

White Ya jumped at her, happy to hold her.
Bai Bai jumped and kicked her.
White Ya was kicked to the ground, a happy face, " kicking is kicking is love, sister you kicking more, kicking me kicking me."
She feels like she's having a heart attack.
And the system is in this moment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She wasted her 119 hours of life on such a stupid thing.
"I love you, sister, you'll kick me."
White Wi bit her as she wished.
Come on, you're fucking nervous.
Chapter 197
When he came out of ther, he saw Bai kicking away, and immediately took out the remote control button of the bomb.
Then he rushed to Biao, and hugged her, and said to Biaao: "I advise you not to move lightly, now as long as I press this button..."
"Well, you white- how did my dad know you were doing this for this bitch?"
Anle took a deep breath, just to say, suddenly he jumped madly, a palm distorted An An'lele's left face.
"You make your sister angry, look at my love palm, blow you a love peach."

Anle touched his face.
"In fact, when I came back, I saw these two bitches dress up for your dad," and continued Dan's life for only ten days, with a five-and-a-half-hour deduction. "I'm afraid you'll be threatened by the bitches, and you'll be in danger of life, and you'll just have to use your life to buy your love package."
"You don't have a bad heart," she said, "let's go straight to the heavens and get some devil's meal."

The system paused and worried to say, "Your life is a few minutes away, and you need to be dismantled, and after this we'll go to the next mission to save our lives."
Vivi knows that's not the time to correct this, her time to divide seconds.
Immediately she said to White Yao: "Give me to dismantle the** on my father."
If you want this bitch's life, you're gonna have to get rid of it.
After thinking about the strange events that had been experienced before, and looking at the change in the nature of Bai Yao, he immediately realized that it must be Bai Yao's devil.
Immediately he held his hands and said, Miss, what have you done to Ya?
Violet's face was cool. "I said, take my father's ass off. "
This is like a flame of love, which hits the heart of White Yao Yao, she suddenly bursts out with a great power, and the peace of the whole person is overturned.
"Yes, sister. even dismantling, is the shape of love love."
White Ya hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand
"You're deaf," said the older sister. "You're deaf.
"You're poisoned? You're awake, and you're not going to be able to stand in the white house if it's taken down."
They have gone to this day, they have been thrown away, without any way back.
As soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died, and as soon as he died,
White Ya suddenly thought of something, and hastened to find out from the safety of the gun, over his jaw, "Take me away, you pig, my sister-in-law, and do not take me away to show you."
Chapter 198
Ann was shocked.
Beaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
"Yes, my sister.I'll definitely throw a bullet in the shape of love. killing and suicide are all shapes of love."
White wasted her face: she didn't want to talk to this loving intellectual, she felt her intellectuals were being pulled down to the bottom of her heart.
Neither will he be able to kill himself with the devil.
He does so much, not for the sake of White Yao.
White Chang fell asleep because of taking anesthesia.
When she saw her father lying tired, the tears of her eyes almost stopped her.
Even though he slowed down his feet, the demolition was just a few steps, and then the demolition was done.
White Ya eyes shining, "Sister," "I've got it."
"You're good," she nodded. ""You're good,""I'll take him to death. ""
Tears flowed from the eyes of the white, "You are so beautiful, to love me, to hate to become a fire, to burn in the heavens is to love care."

"It's time for us to die," said the elder sister, "It's time to die."
She picked up her gun and fired straight at her.
But at the moment, the cat rolled under the body, escaped the bullet, fell before her hand, reached out to take her handgun.
His hands are much better than White Yao.
Take it seriously, ten white yao are not his opponent.
As her face changed, she knew that if she had a diarrhoea, she would not have escaped from her poison.
And she heard a familiar reminder.
10 9 10
There's no time.
With a sharp eye, she shouted directly to Bai: "Let me go upstairs, immediately."
It turns out to be this way, also because it likes white Yao.
If he jumps upstairs, he can only go after him.
Indeed, there was almost no hesitation to jump out, "even jumping, I will jump out of the way you love."
"What's going on you wake up."
He had no way of taking care of anything else but to chase out.
When White Ya looked, it was really going to jump.
Vivian immediately called the company heart, let's come to protect the White Chang.
She'd forgotten it wasn't her phone, and she'd been too quick to press the familiar position, and not to notice that the number recorded wasn't right.
When the phone rang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She didn't say anything.
There was a quiet voice.
Who are you?
She wasted her time looking at her cell phone, not her own cell phone pressed, and she had to call someone.
Whenever she had nothing to say, she cut off the phone immediately, to call the right person, but the time had come.
System free gift to a newer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At last she couldn't stop crying: "You wouldn't have sent anything other than a newbie's big gift?"
Isn't this system so poor that there's still a big gift for newcomers?
CHAPTER 199
Ying looked at the phone, suddenly felt the sound familiar.
But in ecstasy, but do not remember, who is this voice.
He kept working for a while until he remembered that the number was Qin-Ao.
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
Qin's anger has been heard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Huang hanged the phone.
So he's really confused with reality?
Just now he felt that voice, especially like that woman he dreamed of.
But...
He looked down at his cell phone, not a dream, Qin-Qin's cell phone has just, in total, called twice.
He stood up, grabbed the suit on the chair, and went straight out.

When Qin Autumn arrived at the White House, it was seen that the White Yao, in a way that destroyed the soul, hurried to the stairs.
"Sister I love,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"

What are you?
Qin looked foolishly at them to the highest floor run.
Then he immediately went to White.
She fell pale on the side of the bed, and he was astonished, and immediately rushed over to hold her.
He thought something would happen. He had already called the ambulance and the police.
After calling Ye, the ambulance also arrived, carrying the man Ali to the ambulance.
When he jumped, he was stopped by a rain shelter downstairs, severely wounded directly into the operating room.
She is in good condition, life characteristics is not awake.
After awakening, he looked at his daughter with a sad face.
Injured,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But he guessed, and he knew that had something to do with his two daughters.
Angel has been locked up and is being tortured.
When Xiang arrived at the hospital, he saw Qin Xiang sitting at the door of Bai Wei's hospital, silent tears.
He took a step, and came behind Qin and asked, What happened?
Qin returned, holding the phone,"I lost the race again."
Huan didn't take him. "Who borrowed your cell phone just now?"
Qin: "White."
Immediately he pulled the door of the hospital and saw a woman lying there on the bed.
She slept quietly, because of long illness, the beautiful face was a bit sad.
His lips were white and his face was not good, even his long black hair lost some light.
Huan didn't know what he was thinking, he had seen her, after all, his wife, but he had never made any impression on her.
Qin Autumn was not aware of the wrong entered.
"What are you looking at?"
It's too horrible to look at Vivi.
Ye shut up for a moment and said softly: "When she wakes up, I will hear her voice."
Her voice, for a moment, stirred his unburdened emotion, made him hard like a rock heart, and trembled.
CHAPTER 200 The Miss of the Dead (1)
When White woke up, she heard the sound of the system.
[The objective of this mission is to get the love of Song.] [[The objective of this mission is to get the love of Song.] [[The objective of this mission is to get the love of Song Song.] [[The objective of this mission is to get the love of Song Song Song Song.] [[The objective of this mission is to get the love of Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song] [[The objective of this mission is to get the love of Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song Song] [[The objective of this mission is to get the love of Song Song Song Song Song Song Song
She couldn't wait to think of anything, because when she opened her eyes she saw a pair of unbelieving eyes with resentment.
After a pause, she discovered that her hands had thrown a man out.
The young man, whose black hair washed up in the sun, was caught by a few threads, and under the scattered threads was a very handsome face.
And that face, looking with hatred, and thus fell out of the car.
White Wi could have reached for his hand, but only for his sleeves, which, due to the acceleration of gravity, were torn apart, and the man fell, and was instantly drowned in a flower of flesh... dead?
White took a look at her, and breathed cold.
She was standing on the farthest side of the carriage, where the doors were open, and the carriage was full of people, and outside, a crowd of rotten corpses was chasing the carriage at speed.
Whenever a human falls, they will run for food.
The man she had just thrown away, had disappeared from the corpses, and was estimated to have been robbed.
And the familiar reminder sounded.

All of a sudden she remembered a very important thing.
She looked at the piece of cloth hanging on her fingers, and wondered, "The man who was just thrown out of this body..."
The system cheered to remind: "Yes, it's a man."
White washed her hands with blood, and with a good sense of negative.
Did she just throw the man out to feed the dead?
The Master was eaten by the dead. Who did she capture?
Isn't this position
White asked with a shaking voice: "Aye, this face is not going to be a ghost."
System: "Look at the dead who are chasing your cars. normal people know that's the end of the dead."
"But the man who was taken has been eaten."
System: "It's something that the host has to work out, so, go on, love your care."
White Wi wasted face.
What's up with the system, being bound by the evil spirit of White Yao?
The system also reminds the host to start accepting the memory of the body.
The familiar headache came again, White White face much pale.
She had her memories and was silent for a long time.
The purpose of this mission Song Yun with this body White Wei, is a university student.
She is beautiful, so is welcomed by men.
Song is a dead man, who is the kind of technical man in the dormitory to write code every day, although the look is good, but the personality does not like the girl at all.
These two guys couldn't have gotten together.
But I couldn't have imagined that white woman was a green bitch, she was pure on the surface, but she was really enjoying herself, with her poor appearance, getting a man's feeling of vanity.

Song Yun will be seen by her, or because he comes alone, no woman can come near the reason.
She thinks it's challenging to be a man who doesn't see any woman.
So I bet with my friends, that I can within a month, to capture the Song Yun this never close to female stubborn stone.
Because of not having talked about love, Song was once confused by white Wei's pure appearance, and agreed to her confession.
As a result, two men were friends for three days, and were just getting to the stage of watching a movie.
Sung Yuan looked at the seriousness of White Wei.
I even know she's betting on a friend.
Feeling Deceived by Song, she posted some of her deceived men's bad deeds on the Internet.
He also asked for a break.
White Wi felt severely humiliated, just to retaliate to Song, the last day virus just to explode, to die in the city.
Two men who just broke up were forced to flee.
Because there were too many people who had fled, there was only one truck.
Song Yuan at one time good heart, dragged her up, and the result was that Bai Wei thought of his shame, at one time in the spirit of revenge, on the back of the car will not be prepared for him, to push down to feed the dead.
And she just pulled the man, and white white came through.
White Wei looked at his hands, how can not react quickly to pull Song, now Song is eaten dead.
Who is she going to take?
Get Dead?
No,you should be thinking about how to live.
Due to the truck, she stood by the door, and was easily pushed down.
Someone has begun to force her out, and if she falls, she is probably destined to feed the dead.
Once again, the system reminds, "The branch task reward is issued, please accept the host."

The best reward comes from a super strong survival skill.

Better come with a gold finger that can live without eating.
The man in front of the truck suddenly shouted, "No, the car can't accelerate, so we'll be followed by the dead."
There are too many people, and the car is too heavy, and if the car fails, one person will have to feed the dead.
"No... let some people get off?"
I don't know who said this.
But this is almost all the people, the common idea.
But everybody doesn't want to be in the car right now.
A car is the fate of the dead.
Bai Bai stood by the rear door of the car, one step out is outside the car.
If you want to eliminate some people, she is the first to be eliminated.
Indeed, someone began to push her out of the car.
When she looked back, she found out that was a teacher at the same school.
A gentle man who is so selfish.
When she was about to say something, there was a sudden wind blowing, and the system sounded like, "Bing!
Suddenly appeared the subtitle floating pink love bubble.
Her curly long brown hair washed up by the wind, her bright stars shining with a moving light, as pure as a deer.

But the teacher stared at her, and suddenly turned red.
She's about to say something.
There was another set of pink subtitles.
I saw the pity on her face.

CHAPTER 202 The Miss of The Dead King (3)
As if her sadness had caught her heart, he immediately drew her hand, "Don't stand here, it's easy to fall down; let's go in."
Didn't you just push her down?
This attitude has changed rapidly.
Their teacher pushed them away and dragged them to the top of the car.
She realizes that is a great teacher, many people are afraid of him, even his orders many people listen.
If it were someone else, at this end of the day, dare to push into the car, it is estimated that the offender will be thrown away in anger.
They've come to the top.
There is a small group, the head of the group is one.
Therapist locked her into one of the innermost seats, "Vyvy, you sit here, until the car leaves the city, and my uncle will come and take me."
Then he sat beside her and looked at her with shame.
White Wi listened to discuss how to get some people out of the car.
It was only after she had heard that the schoolmaster had the right, and that a particular uncle was the chief of the army.
None of the people in this small group are the same class as Lin Xiao.
This also tells Vivian why these people are treated so well.
There's no oil in the car, but if there's a couple of generations of cow forks in the car, there's gonna be someone to save them.
When she heard the cries of someone, she frowned and was about to say something.
"Don't be afraid," he said, "there are always people who fall out of an accident, and you won't be in trouble."
White White looked at him.
Did she know him?
In the Master's memory, The Master was low temper, but never played with these people.
Isn't Linsha in love with the original White White.
That's what she thought.
The Pink Bubble Subtitles appeared again.
Her beautiful, soft as the clouds of the sky, and as the mist of the sea, fragile to the heart of compassion, could not help to hold her, to protect her.
"Don't worry," said Lin, "I'll protect you, and I won't let you get hit by the rain."
Without saying anything, she knocked on the system, "What's the matter with that pink subtitle?"
Only she could see her embarrasment.
System::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
White wasted,"Can I shield myself?"
Such subtitles can make people commit suicide. It's unbearable.

It was when Linsha was excited to protect her.
The system reminder sounded suddenly.

Isn't Song still alive?
And at this moment that swallowed Song's corpse pile, the unconscious corpses suddenly made a terrible hoarse voice.
It's like fear warning.
All the dead were suddenly twisted, and the rotten bodies were ripped apart by a huge space force.
And in the pile of rotten flesh and bones, suddenly appeared a pale hand, full of blood, and bent slowly.
Then he stood up slowly, handsome to the evil face, in the middle of the black eyes was a circle of blood redness, he suddenly smiled gently.
The laugh wasted.
"I'll eat you."
CHAPTER 203
When the car began to confuse, White was ready.
There are too many people, and the speed is too slow, and even if there were two generations of Lin Xiao, there would be a great disaster.
Any two generations are not good.
Especially when a corpse jumped to the top of the car, and several people stood at the rear door, when the corpse was dragged down, many people in the car crashed directly.
They started shouting at each other, and many of them got off.
And it was found that there seemed to be more and more corpses, and there seemed to be others, but the corpses didn't know what they were attracted to, and they were chasing the car without leaving.
Finally a terrible wave of deaths followed them.
This is a terrible scene. enough to scare the brave.
"Is there anything to remove the dead?
The system immediately got excited and said, "Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

There's nothing you can take if you're eaten by the dead.
System: "It's expensive. You can't credit it."
"I've done so many tasks, why don't I save some life? You say, did you steal my life, did you make me lose everything?"
The system got serious, "How can you have nothing?"
V: What else did she not see?
The system's cheer- "You're with me."

The system gave her a kiss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I'm gonna go,,I'm gonna go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go.
Vivi only felt a bit of old blood to to, this broken system, to keep the heart diaphragm to her is not.
It's better not to have a system like this.
And the system is the poison of love love how to speak style so... brain damage.
Linshao suddenly grasped White and said with a solemn face, "White, don't be afraid, I won't let you go."
She did not know at all what a strange delusion the enchantment had given Lin Xiao.
Linshao suddenly sounded ashamed, "Will you marry when we are safe?"

"I've got all the names of our children, I'd better have two, one boy like me, one girl like you... hey, then we'll be together seven years old and eighty years old, and we'll be together in the sunset, and we'll be together in the sunset."
She feels ache and doesn't have any heart disease.
Suddenly there was a loud sound on the top of the car, as if something had jumped on top.
After a shock, the car slid, and White White felt that the car was unbalanced, and the whole person fell forward.
Lin Xiao grabbed her, and the two almost rolled into one.
The car was like hit something, a shock, many of the people in the car were thrown out of the car.
The Dead.
begin to bite human.
The scene was horrible, heavy bloody smell spread in the air.
The car also began to slow, suddenly the car emitted a silence, but stopped for a moment.
Everyone shouted. The car stopped means they were going to die.
Lin's reaction was awful, and he grabbed Vivian's hand for a moment, kicked a few people, and pulled out of the car, jumped out of the car, and ran to the front.
CHAPTER 204
Those who were not able to get out of the car, the dead who were chased up were crowded up.
She didn't turn, but heard the cries of the dead.
And there's people screaming.
It's like hell.
Liang hurried ahead of the edge of the city, an abandoned commercial area appeared.
He said,We can jump over here and get out of the city. My uncle is out of the city.
She suddenly shook Xiao's hand and said calmly, "You run first, I can't follow you."
She said the truth, she did not follow his footsteps.
Lin looked like he had practiced, and he was a big man, so his legs were much better than hers.
She followed him to such an extent that was already the limit.
Now her legs are heavy and her heart beats so fast that her chest hurts.
She knows very well where the limit of one's physical strength is, She is now the limit.
It doesn't matter whether it's because of the popularity, Lin Xiao's personality is good, you can run one.
Lin looked back and was moved, "You are so good, you have not only the most moving eyes in the world, but also the most beautiful heart."
She thought she couldn't help herself, and Lin went on to say, "Why are you so cute, so beautiful, so..."
P P P
It's just a hand.
You can't talk if you give Lin a little.

Just after escaping several dead attacks, Lin realized that he could not run out of the city with the burden of Vivian.
Even if it's the world's most beautiful burden.
But my life is the most important.
Liang said goodbye,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I'll see you when I come back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then he ran away.

System::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Vivian listened to the system and put her life forward.
Several dead bodies came up, smell of rot, almost made Bai Bai's stomach sick.
I don't know if it's a mistake these dead bodies seem to be catching her.
Whenever she thought she would be pursued, the dead would slow down.
Vivian saw the warehouse the system said, she jumped into the warehouse, shut the door with force, and all the heavy stuff pushed to the front of the door.
The chased dead bodies were screaming outside the door, they struck the door, screaming.
Vivian wasted her sweat, and if she were to be bitten by these things, she would have to kill herself at once.
It's too ugly to be dead.
She refused.
But the warehouse's doors were so tight that the dead could not get in at any time.
White Wi sits on the ground and complains to the system, "I think there's nothing wrong with the dead out there but Song."
Yuan fell into a pile of corpses, it is impossible to live again.
If he's still alive, he must be dead.
System: "May."
"I'm going to get to the target, not a piece of meat, two eyes out, seven holes, thin hair."
All the bodies outside are like this.
System::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Vivian: "I've suddenly got a question."
System:What's the problem?

System: It's too much forty, is it not too low for the host to hang on for days?
CHAPTER 205
Shire Wei: "The first face was 50, and the first face was the one who pushed Song into the pile of corpses, and he was only 40.
System: Is the host's focus shifting?
She's talking to the system, but she's just distracting.
After all, out there are dead people are afraid.
Vivian looked at the door. "It's good that the door is strong, otherwise I'll be eaten."
When she had finished, suddenly the door shivered, and the bolts on the door burst one by one.
Vivian with the system:...

Violet sat on the ground and watched the sun shine through the door.
A Master appeared outside the door, with the back of the light, with the dark hair of strange glow, with the face of the most handsome with a twisted fairy smile.
"I found you white white."
His voice, with a little hoarse, had a strange sexy.
Within a second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then she returned to the expression of fear, the voice shaking, "Song Yang?"
His eyes were dim, his eyes were brighter, and he laughed, "Yeah, didn't you think I'd come back?"
Tears rolled down her eyes, and after a few cries, she climbed up from the ground, and screamed at him, and then her hands stretched out to hold him.
She cried,,You're not dead.It's really good.You're not dead.
Her cry was filled with joy, guilt, and relief.
Zhong's body was hard, and with a hoarse cold, just like the body.
He looked at White, and laughed more, "I thought, you know, I'm dead."
She put out her fist and beat his chest, "I hate that you die, that you can hurt me, that I've never loved a man so much, that you can hurt me so much."
Her tone was with a tenderness.
Song seems to have some misunderstanding of her attitude,"Do you like me?"
"What do you mean,I've always liked you,and it's not easy to summon up the courage when you're a girl,and you've turned aside from me,and you've been doing something on the Internet to insult me,you know,I hate you.I hate you.I hate you.I hate you."
Song Yun's eyes brightened, his mouth smile more strange, "Love?"
"Of course, do you think I'll like you? Do you know how much I like you lose face? You're poor, you're introverted, my friends say you're not at all pleasant, and I've been trying to get married to a rich man since I was a kid, how can I like you as a poor kid."
System::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
"But when I saw that you liked, I kept telling myself that you had no future, nor could you give me my life.But I still liked you, but I couldn't keep my face from following you, and as soon as my roommate betted with me, I ran downstairs and confessed to you."
Zhong Shut up.
"You're going to agree to make friends with me."
S S S S S S
"You don't like me. I lost my hand..." "I'm glad you didn't die."
Song suddenly smiled,You really like me?
She's sorry She's always confessing you don't have a face.
Song Yun extended his hand, lifted her smile brighter, "I confess too, I especially like... you are eaten by the dead. "
When he had finished, he threw her out.
All dead outside.

She also thinks her performance with the spirit of the people, how can make Song Yun's heart a bit soft.
This is an opportunity to remind: "Everyone who is obsessed with air quality is only useful to those who have a better sensitivity than zero."
Song,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
She fell onto the ground, her hands grinding to reduce the force, all the skin was grinded, and the blood immediately flowed out.
The dead outside, like smell of fresh meat, excitedly cried around.
White's pupils tightened, "Are there any uses for this kind of stuff?"
System::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
It's unconscious if you don't step.
Now the end of the world begins, the order of the dead, also only one Song Yun.
Vivian: "So this branch award has nothing to do with anything other than confusing the people of the street?"
System Encourage: "When you reach a good sensitivity of zero or more, the air will be useful."
"The devil can wait till that time, it will be eaten."
She just said to the system, Several dead bodies have jumped.
She was frightened to the ground, frightened to escape the attack of the dead, she looked at Song Yun, eyes are helpless despair.
Song Yuan still smiled, standing in the sun, the eyes were dark ghost.
The Dead seem to have been ordered, and the attack on White Wive is fast.
They opened their mouths, exposed their smelly teeth, and ran quickly, to catch White Wei.
There was nowhere to hide, because the whole warehouse was surrounded by dead.
There were no bodies in the warehouse, except for Song.
There was nothing to look at, but she would rather be torn to pieces by Song and not eaten by the dead.
I'm going to play, at least Song is handsome.
As a result of just running into the warehouse, the foot was dragged by something, the whole person was thrown to the ground.
A dead hand grabbed her leg and dragged her out of the warehouse.
White Wi finger grasped the ground, finger belly bleeded.
She felt the nails of the deceased, attached to the flesh of her leg, and the blood began to pour out.
Violet was shaking and suddenly felt she was under a shadow.
As soon as he lifted his head and saw that Song had come to her before, he squatted slowly, the face of the handsome, still that strange laugh.
Even the smile mixed with a bit of malicious satisfaction.
"Do you know that's what I was like when you pushed me out of the car," she said. "I'm desperate and I don't have a way, but I'm being eaten alive by the dead."
White Wei looked at him, eyes red, she shouted: "I'm sorry, Song."
Song's smile turned,"What's wrong?You're a woman, not the most selfish, how can you apologize to me."
White Wi was dragged out step by step, she put her fingers on the ground, but her eyes looked dead at Song.
"I'm sorry, Song. I know I'm not a good man. I'm selfish and worthless, I'm careful and I'm enjoying myself, but I'm not really intentional, I don't want you to die, I just want to frighten you, I don't think I can't hold your hand in the end."
Here she said, without crying, she reached out with the last of her power, and grasped his hand.
His Sleeve broke a corner.
CHAPTER 207 The Dead King's Girlfriend (8)
It's when White pulled him up, it's ripped apart.
She's doing her best to hold his hand. "I'm sorry."
she said with a feeling of guilt.
Song did not struggle, let her death pull his hand.
She was about to lose her power, and the power of the dead was so strong that it was not possible for man to resist, and she had reached the limit of her power.
Suddenly Song's fingers tightened, holding her back.
A gleam in white white white white white white white white white white white white white
Song's voice was soft, "I believe you are not deliberate, but..."
He bent his thin lips, and the darkness of his eyes trembled, But what about that?
When he had finished, a finger, a finger, loosened the power, and left the light dim in the eyes of White Wei.
White Wi because of the loose hand, was dragged out the dead.
The finger of the deceased had been caught in the flesh of her little leg, and the skin of her head had been burned.
She was pulled out of the warehouse, the sun splashed on her, the corpse jumped up, one hit one, and jumped on her.
White Wi felt her legs, hands, and back of the deceased were crushed, bit through.

She lifted her head, and her eyes were filled with despair, and with self-blame.
But there is no hatred.
Before her body was drowned, Song saw her mouth open and say a word.
"Song Yun, I'm sorry."
It's like she's just trying to frighten him, but she can't get hold of him.
Yuan suddenly exited the warehouse.
Their deaths,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When Zhong wakes up, he realizes that he is full of rot, but the flesh does not know why is constantly reorganizing.
It didn't turn out to be so ugly.
It's nothing different from what it used to be.
The only difference is that he has infinite energy, strong power.
There's a body like a body.
I didn't even have a heartbeat.
He hated White and hated her.
This resentment made him want to give Vivian a taste of what she had experienced.
Even though she doesn't hurt, she feels where she's been hurt.
There's no good meat to describe her.
Beaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
Her face was very white, with all the traces of the tearing of the dead, and she was very unbearable.
When Song Yong came to her side, she suddenly looked at him.
Her face was not attacked, Qing, with a little tenderness, now looking at him, without any end to bring a little poor tenderness.
Song asked softly: "Is it pain?"
Violet looked at him, as though he had been in pain.
Suddenly she reached for her fingers and blood flowed from her hands.
"Song Yun-"
Whiteway approached him.
Song Yun stood very well, he lowered his head not minding "thank you" one.
It's like treating a poor, but not a hunter.
Violet was struggling to sit up, which was already the limit of her body, she could not stand up, her hands had just touched his face.
CHAPTER 208
Dust and blood on his fingers.
Zhong seems to be waiting for the curse she hates.
Sheaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Song Yun replied: "Yes."
"Will you say something to me before I die?"
Zhong did not respond and looked at her.
With another hand suddenly grasped his clothes, drew down his head, she played with the last power.
Zhong's body is stiff, eyes are deeper red.
As soon as the kiss washed away, she smiled and said, I have deceived you many times, deceived you purely, deceived you sincerely, deceived you poorly.
She laughed, but her eyes were crying.
"I'm sorry I didn't catch your hand and get you out of the car."
Her voice weakened.
"I didn't mean..."
Her fingers lost strength and slowly loosened his clothes.
"Song Yun, I love you..."
She fell back onto the ground, and her eyes began to lose their brightness.
Finally, darkness came, she finally completely lost consciousness.
Song Zhong paused for a moment, but after knowing, reached out and touched his lips.
It was his first kiss, with the blood of her fingers on her lips.
He stretched out his tongue and licked, and the blood smelled sweet.
To him, man is indeed very good food.
I like you.
Like it?

She was sure she was going to die.
She's been grabbed, bit, and the virus is sure to infect her.
Low life insurance can only last for one day, and one day she feels unbearable pain.
Burning, cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She confusedly communicated with the system: "Shang, how do I become a corpse and capture Song? By the time I was bald, my teeth were distorted, my face was full of rotten flesh, my intestines were moving out and out, he must not have a good sensitivity."
"It's okay," she said, "I'll wash the rotten meat, I'll put the intestines back, I'll sew it with a needle, and I'll look good on the top of my hair."
"Are you really cute?"
System::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Violet felt she had more power to fight, she didn't know how long to struggle, finally opened her eyes.
Everything in front of her makes her doubt.
This is a room in an old house.
Some are old, but they are very clean, and they have a very homey taste.
Looks like you've been living for years.
She slept in bed, and the light green curtains were blown by the wind.
White Wi sits up and finds herself not dead, the wounds become white traces.
It is a characteristic of human.
Being bitten like that didn't turn into a dead body.
She took a breath and went out of the room with her bare feet.
Then she saw in the living room, Song, sitting on the sofa, reading, seriously focused.
When Song saw her go out, gently asked: "Are you awake?"
"I'm not dead?"
Song shook his head,"You are very special, immune to the dead virus."
White wasted a moment, and when she returned, she laughed sweetly, "Isn't it? I'm lucky."
Song,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
She didn't think he'd ask this, some shy low, after a moment of silence, finally braved to raise her head.
Her eyes were bright and full of laughter, "Yeah, I like you."
Song Yun put his finger on the book, did not know why the force.
He pressed down those uncomfortable little movements, and went before her, and touched her face gently.
Then he smiled softly, "If you really like me, can you die for me?"

Chapter 368
There was a lot of fire on both sides, and there was a lot of smoke over the sea.
The high-speed scanning gun in his hand at night fired again, and another plane was blown up by him, which was a very good gun, and he was addicted to it, and the little milk bag commanded himself,
The First Terrorist Air Force formed a formidable defensive unit and began the last round of assault.
When Nikla saw the situation was not worthy, the voice raised, "Lord, retreat, let's go again, we'll have the whole army.
Louis's fist was so tight, his face was so dark, and his spirit was so fierce that he could not see what was going on, but he was so unwilling that he was thrown back, and he was so close that he could catch them, and it was so bad.
The man's jade eyes, passing through the killing, turned again into the silent eyes, he pointed to Nikla, he immediately ordered the cover retreat.
Lewis stared at the two of them floating over the sea, and hummed, this time they were lucky, he would not have.
"Baby, are they going to retreat?
Laughing at night, he had his own clock to the magnetic scanner, holding it as if holding a child, with a faint and dangerous smile on his lips.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
This game has turned the situation.
Louis, he shouldn't, he shouldn't be attracted to him, Nono's death, he must find someone to be buried, or he can't breathe this.
When did the game start?
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
"Yes, don't pursue, we have the capital to play with," he said. "I don't know if they're going to get it done.
The little bottle looked at the direction of their escape, laughing silently.
"It's over," said Chu. "There's no more support. we'll go right now."
White Night and Chu left the telephone and ordered the hand to turn back to Rome.
They knew that had a virus, they had taken precautions, and they had been warned that they had a virus, and they had been careful.
Li lying down, breathing like a cow, couldn't help kicking the girl, Little Anna, you have to lose weight, dead again.
His whole shoulder had a bit of hair, because he had been in the sea for a long time, consuming a lot of energy, and then hanging on to Anja's arm, which was so floating, that it was really folded.
He didn't catch her out of the sea, but he still felt a bit creepy when he remembered the scene.
All the Black Eagles were happy because they were safe, handing over towels handing over towels, handing over hot water, one can't be busy, and one can't be entertained in the air.
There was a lot of fun on the plane, and the men were together.
She washed her hair with the black eagle handed over, and wrapped her cold body with a blanket.
She had a sneeze and couldn't help but tighten up.
The Black Eagle, laughing, said, Thirty-three, madam, thinner than you want her to be.
"I don't like it now.
The three leaves came up and wiped the sea, because the bones were so heavy.
The Black Eagle had two pairs of clothes to change, because it was a man's dress, which was very funny on Miss Cheung, and she barely wrapped herself in a blanket.
As soon as he changed his clothes, the Black Eagle told her that she would rather speak to her.
Jiang Yang excitedly grabbed the phone, " baby, it's Mom.
Hi, Mom, do you want a baby?The little baby sat on the couch, smiling, and chatting with Cheng Anya, hadn't heard her mom's voice for a long time.
"I don't want at all.
"You're too busy to find Mommy tonight," he said.
Better to think of a promise, tos of heart, and to smile, "Well, baby, wait for you to return to Rome, and you can do whatever you like,
I miss you don't hurt me, you disrespect me.
"Resentment."
Joan laughed, and asked, Are you not hurt?
"No, I'm fine, there's nothing to worry about," said Nan, smiling, "Mommy, the plane's about to land," said Nan.
"All right.
The little milk bag shut the communications, Cheng Anya drinking hot water warming the body, the Leth three little eyes looked to be able to talk to the son, and the result of not talk to hang on, He was very dissatisfied, eyes complaining to Che Che Che Anya.
Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss
Ye, feeling completely ignored, couldn't resist twisting Miss Cheng, "no conscience little thing.
"The little bastard."
Joan laughed, and gave him the hot water, and he drank the rest of the hot water.
It would be more beautiful to be warmed with a little wine.
As soon as the plane landed in the castle, Chu, Ye Wei, and the eleven others were there, and as soon as Ye three and the flight was safe, all of them breathed.
"My brother and sister, it's really confusing..."
Levy laughed and trembled, "Brother, I should have taken it for a memorial.
"The filthy girl."
Xiao laughed and said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's taken so long. How can it happen again?
Little Couple wanted to hold Anya, but she was forced to drink, Little Couple it came to mind, his mother had a virus, the Black Eagle had said, and then he looked at his father's mother's hands, and his heart sank a little.
"Dad, Mum, you all...night, you're going to help them."
The first reaction is to find the night, he is a genius, without he can't cure the disease.
You know, Don't worry.
laughed.
"Virus?"
A Man with Gold and Blue Eyes blinked, Little White, isn't that your strength?
Little White?
Their wrists twisted, smiling softly, Jason, shout a little white try again?
What's up with the old man calling you little white?
It was little white, and you call it black jack little iron.
Jason, known as the Flaming Dragon, is on the scene flaming, like the King of the Golden Fleece, but as handsome as the gods resent.
Especially those blue eyes, as bright as blue gems.
There was a burning flame, like a volcano, and a very outward kind of hegemony.
Black Jack was a young man of more than twenty years of age, who was a mixture of Chinese and English, and who possessed the mystery of the East and the depth of the West.
A pair of gray blue eyes, which always look like fog, give one a deep feeling, but look closely, you will find that he is extremely sharp, and has a deep and unspoiled convergence.
The two leaders of the first terrorist organization, are not old, have different characteristics, but the atmosphere is strong, one has a kind of kingdom of the world, not to mention the three great capitals here.
This line looks past. It's very visual.
Jason, you must have been repaired.
No No No No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of them.
Eve looked at them, shaking her head, "Brothers, sisters, don't worry about them, you'll take a hot shower, take another look, and you won't get sick.
She invited the maid to take Yechen and Cheng Anya down to wash and wash, and the little lad, though he wanted to follow, stayed here, and at night he was going to beat, and the little lad quickly pulled his sleeves.
"Byee, can you save my mother?"
The children's eyes are bright, like two black grapes embedded in the pale face, full of expectation, as if at a white night, the light in his eyes will fade.
Jason grabbed the little bottle in his arms, with a great deal of pride, " baby, you can rest assured that little white dead man will be saved, and not that living man,
You're worried about shit. There's a chance to blow up the black party's defense.
"Who ever questioned therapist at night?" Black Jack doubted, and Jason glanced away.
The little bottle was held by a tall boy, with an unusual twist, kicked Jason, "Let me down.
"The old man wants such a son," said the old man. "The old man wants such a son.
Jason's blue eyes shining, like a small milk bag is a fat meat.
All of them.
He said with a smile at night, Jason, don't let your mother teach you in Chinese, and don't keep saying the Chief won't use words, and you won't get anywhere.
"I'm not on a level, okay?"
Jason was dissatisfied with the fact that he had been linked to the Chief, the so-called Chief of Staff, was a matter of principle.
After a struggle, Jason let him down, he asked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Be quiet," he said. "Be quiet until I check them and make sure you don't have to hurry."
"I'm sure I'll do my best," said White.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
"Don't worry," said White.
"It is," said Eve, "it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it is, it
Chu smiled, "I agree."
Little White, do you have a sign?
Jason was deeply doubting he had no sign at all.
Eleven wanted to beat him.
"How come you two didn't catch Louis back?" asked Black Jack, "This guy's gonna die soon.
"The old man wanted to kill him," he said. "The gang is all over the place, and the guy's headquarters have been bombed, and he's got a good mood, and he's pretty stupid."
Louis was not in a hurry, said the little bottle, with a dangerous curve on his face, and with his dark eyes the brightness of a calculator. He and we have one thing in common, but the fight between the gangs and the terrorists is another.
It's going to cost a lot of money.
Throughout this time, his position in the Black Party has been shaken, and I have always doubted that the Black Party still has a power hidden from us, or that they will not be able to stop this act of self-destruction of Louis, and since so, we shall let Louis take the way for us, and seize this power, and destroy it.
Fraud!
That's what everybody agrees on.
Knowing he was always angry and dangerous, but because he was too young, people would always fall in love, plus a long pink appearance, always let go of his essence.
"I'm in the dark!"
Jason raised his thumb, he was always an action, not the rest thought about so much, but most of the time he would listen to the plans of Black Jack and Chu.
He always listened to the plan of the little milk.
After a full movement there is a powerful group of thinkers, which is a terrifying force.
"I agree with this method," said Chu, who had always agreed with his ideas, "it will be a long time before someone who is not high and thick will come and provoke."
"If it is," he said, "when have you refuted it?
Black Jack laughed, but this time, he must teach the Black Party a lesson, that in fifty years he will see us go.
He had no concern,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ye and 11 look at each other, another force?
In their hearts a face like a touch, is it a black and a black?
Within the Black Party, only they could have enough summons, and mysterious, except for them, they could not think of anyone else, who could have such power, and who should have been the man over whom Louis, without reason, obeyed.
All the crowded into the room, and the little bottle of milk went to Cheng-and she had taken a good bath, and a cup of hot tea, and she was warm and baked, and her cheeks were red, and she was in bed looking at her fingers, if she had thought.
"Mom...
"The little bottle pushed into the door and came close with laughter.
Joan came back to God, squinted, and praised, "Honey, you have a fan.
This costume, which has a little bit of a child's taste, is a dangerous person.
"Thank you," Mom said.
Don't come near, sit away, I'm afraid I can't beat you.
Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go
The little bottle stared angrily at her, "Ma, you don't want to leave me.
"The correct answer. "
Joan laughed, looked at the little bottle, she always felt that the child had something different, though it looked nothing like the past, but the mother was the most aware of her child, of what had changed in him, how well she could feel, no matter what she had hidden.
"Mom, how do you think of me?
Do you think your baby is cute?
The little milk bag blinked angrily, look very cute.
Joan looked at him smilingly, "You've learned a lot about your father's love, aren't you? Tell Mommy the truth
Have you been deceived?
Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak
"Well," said Louis, "I've seen the pictures, and it's clear that he's been beaten with blood."
Chen, apparently, did not believe, and bite his teeth, "He's been beaten with a thousand knives, and I don't hate him.
Reminded of all that she had encountered, she hated Louis in her heart.
Her bright face washed with cold, and her feelings were worse when she thought of what she had been through.
Mommy, I'm all right, it's mostly his.
The little bottle smiled gracefully, held up the sleeves, revealed a white arm, "Look, there is no wound.
His arm was healed seven eight, and soon, he was no more afraid of being found by Cheng An.
All the whips he'd been whipped had been left, and since he'd been whipped, he didn't feel like he'd been deceived, but rather he felt the pain of being whipped.
If No was alive, he would have been beaten like this all his life.
"It's okay?
Cheng Anja glanced, did not miss the pain in the eyes of the son flashed.
Little Milk nodded,I'm really okay, Mommy, it's you and Daddy, Daddy says you've got a virus, and Daddy's got a virus.
She thought of the three leaves of the beetle, and her cheeks were red again, and she had no desire or hope to say, "Don't mention, I jumped once in the desert, I jumped once in the sea, and how can I not touch it."
Miss Cheung said softly, and the little milk bag had no doubt of him.
"Mom, it's not going to happen," said therapist. "It's so bright that there must be a way to save you."
CHAPTER 369
At night, after a detailed examination, the two were separately taken out of the blood to make a more comprehensive analysis, his face was rarely condensed, the small milk bag had a less than good sense.
At first he was struck, infected with germs, the doctor determined not to amputate to survive, but at night did not see even a glance, leaving a sarcastic word, entered the laboratory elegantly.
It's like there's no disease in the world that can't be beaten by a genius. Last year, Chu took 23 shots.
He's a mythical existence, shouldn't make him feel awkward disease.
But this time, as Jason was expecting, the virus was not strong for the white night, and once he had shown his consternation, it was clear that things were not going well, for which Jason was very friendly and sympathetic to the white night.
You've finally encountered doubt, it's hard, it's better than a little milk bag in the field of computer technology is a mythical existence, but is broken by two brothers.
White Night contacted Rome ten virus experts came to the castle to study together, the whole castle fell into a congested atmosphere.
The party is very clear.
She had her eyes opened, and on her way she felt that even death was not much.
She had a life of love,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She knew enough of the days when the rocks were falling.
The only regret is not to see the peace, now the wish for her is also realized, so to live and to die she is no matter, even less to leave.
Neither was afraid of death and showed much more than they had expected to calm down.
said Chu, that is the spirit.
As they were in the conference room talking about the virus, and about the remaining five days of life, Chen suddenly remembered one thing, "You shouldn't be able to delay the trial of the virus for us for a few days.
Once again, she was about to forget the face and Chu away from this thing.
Even though he had not told them to take the message to Chu, how could not take it, it was a compromise, even though he had not said, Cheng Anja and Ying Zhao would have informed Chu.
As soon as Chu opened his eyes and his eyes were fixed on Cheng-the kind of eyes that, in silence, with a sharpness of urgency, frightened Cheng Cheng; and as Jason and Black Jack and others were laughing, they were suddenly quieted.
"There's news about you."
asked Chu calmly, his tone normal, but too suppressed, he was tight, everyone could see, he was very stiff.
The Little Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che Che
He left only two words and hurried away. Jason Black Jack hurried to get up and follow him.
It's hard to see him in a hurry.
There'll be another massive military operation, with the three giants fighting together, and it'll be absolutely fierce.
Eve is in the heart for Prince William.
Someone's half of Jiangshan must be gone, it's not all gone.
Now that's all he's got on his mom's virus, he's thinking, a man comes up, "My little lord, Chugo, let me go to the library.
The little milk wrapped his lips. "Dad, Mom, I'll come with you for a while."
At a glance, Zhang and Zhao Zhao had a sense of the beginning of my family, little lord, it seems that the first terrorist organization is established, look at this attitude, which is different from the good son before her.
After all, since the son has chosen, then a way to the dark, she supported.
It's a very proud thing. It's a very proud thing.
If Jian had a thoughtful look at his shadow disappearing in the corridor, return to God to ask Eve, Eve, what is going on?
"I'm a mother," she said, "but the little milk doesn't mean she'll believe he's all right.
Eve admired her three sisters' sharpness, and when she looked at the eleven, considering not to say anything about the promise, she knew at a glance that something must have been hidden from them.
"Vyvy," said she.
Eve took a look at them, and spoke of Ninening and the promise, including the death of the promise, the small milk bag blind, fifteen and ten, without concealing.
The more he listened, the heavier his heart was.
Surprisingly, she thought his eyes were different, rather than so clear and clean in the past, even though his background was different, he was in the past just a child, and somewhat simple.
There are things that she's experienced, that she's been shocked by, that she's changed her eyes, that she's come out feeling different, that she's not more than that.
Leth also twisted his eye, a little heartache of the son's experience, and in the heart of all self-blame, that if it were to change the way Anja died for him, I am afraid he would not be able to go mad, why is blindness so simple.
This is very similar to what happened to him in the past.
"The girl is sure she is dead," she asked.
Levy nodded,Our people have searched and confirmed that is dead,and when I say No,I'm going to be angry.
Levy, touching the table, said of the promise again, All the evil things are paralyzed on Nono, the Lord is a king.
Ye had a little to do with his business, and he was a good man, and could not have been so enthusiastic, could he not have had an inner feeling?
"No," said 11, "I have looked at the family, and indeed there is such a plan, even though it is a plan, but it is true that the family also has such a curse, but it is too cruel for the parents to give up their promises and to let others grow up.
And they were silent, and said, Behold, the future of my son is grievous.
Especially Chen, she was not anxious, but she knew her son best, looked like the past, but after all, it was only a deceiving image.
When the heart is as dead as flesh.
Don't worry too much either. After all, you're a little girl, and maybe you'll grow up.
After all, said Y, two children, the feelings are deeper, and with the passage of time they will gradually fade.
Even deeper love in this world can not withstand the destruction of time.
Chen smiled, and said a soft yes, only to make them feel better, even the three of them know that it is harder to forget than to remember.
It takes just a second to love someone.
Forget about one, but for life.
Ye asked little about the recent of the dragon, Ye Wei did not hide, said 15, the situation is not optimistic, the three giants of the dragon are in trouble, especially Lin Yean, the recent trouble is continuing.
Brother, don't worry about this. It's only right that you've got the virus out of you.
Levy laughed,This thing is not going to go, it's going to take a break, it's going to take a rest, you don't know, sir, it's been a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time.
Can't the new weapons war, and the world's largest illegal weapons dealer, blow?
According to Jason last night, there have been ten or three countries that have purchased the gun for free, and all weighted countries that have issued joint statements to oppose terrorists and eliminate terrorist organizations, and as a result have been paying for our weapons.
So say, truth, you are the cloud!
Eve laughed more.
Miss Cheung did not comment, Le smiled, and the arms market in Jason, Black Jack and Chu in the hands of three, indeed control many international throat blood.
It's so strong that no one can ignore.
Their next heir would be their family, and the power would be estimated to be greater.
After a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What happened?
The boy didn't mention No when he came back.
"I understand," said Cheung. "Thank you," said Cheung. "If it were not for you, I would have liked to have seen more.
"We're all going to thank you for your life," she said.
At noon, five fighter aircraft took off from the castle, and three helicopters took off from the castle.
In fact this thing can be done by one person, there are no difficulties in the world to make the three heads of terror move together, Jason is bored, Black Jack is bored, anyway, Black Hand Party is not going to make it, just happens to be a life-saving stage, they also want to be active active.
The laboratory was packed with dozens of virus experts in a panic.
His face was so heavy that, for the first time, he put his hands together, and his dim and distant eyebrows were close together.
"Mr. White, who developed this virus?"
"I've been doing this forty years, and I've never seen a virus like this," said the head of the virus team.
"He's working with the Black Party," said White, staring at the decomposition of virus molecules on a huge LCD screen. "The virus is not his stronghold, but he's involved a little, he's involved a little, and he's done a good job, but he's never really seen a virus so complicated.
"That's bad," said the captain. "In June last year, more than a hundred virus experts came to Rome, and one of them was my friend.
He says he's studying a virus for the Black Party, mostly this one.
Can You Find Him?
Ask quietly, more than a hundred virus experts, I'm afraid are the top talent.
"He's dead," said the captain, "and it's clear when you hear it at night.
This group of viruses is under the control of terrorists, is the best group of experts in Rome, they say they can't, I'm afraid...
Hope is low.
"Mr. White, have you no idea?
"I've had one of the most difficult diseases," he shook his head at night.
This virus is too complicated.
"You can get the best remedies for a day. "
' said the captain, 'the medicine is not, but the relief is.'
At most, however, it can only be relieved for about 20 days.
Their eyes were sharp, and their hearts were depressed.
"Mr. White," I said, "I've checked all the virus history. This is a new virus that has never appeared before."
"But in 1934, this virus was spread in Siberia, and it was infectious, and it was a cell virus, and the people who carried it had the same symptoms as Miss Cheung
The only difference is that there is no second wave transmitter, the transmitter, and also a month of life, but the principle should be similar.
The government's external claiming that was a nuclear war leak is actually due to the spread of the virus.
As soon as the white eyes lighted on the report, almost greedy reading the information above, the virus was called su- 1934, extremely scary, that year spread in a small town of Siberia,
Later, the government shut down all exits to prevent the spread of the virus and cleaned up the entire town, killing nearly 50,000 people.
It's also a cell virus that they can find the most similar cases.
"Look at all the information, I want all the the information.
A quiet order, the man nodded, and immediately went down to collect.
A white night with a hand in front of the computer, squinting eyes, in the laboratory, people come and go, shaped hurry, are studying this virus, and all kinds of tests are starting to be combined.
"I don't think so, Mr White," he said, "because they've been studied, they're sure to find a cure."
"It takes a long time to study a new virus," said the captain.
Even with anes, they can only delay it for 20 days, I'm afraid they haven't got it yet.
Besides, this virus is extremely unstable, and is a cell virus, if it is temporary, the relieving agent is not useful, and by the time will surely die.
"Do it yourself," he said.
He washed his face at night, and spoke great words.
Captain
All Louis could have gone Aya and Le Trois a little ruthlessly, and you want him to give a cure, which is impossible.
He would have expected that they would have given Miss Li and Miss Li, and he would have expected that they would not have, and that he would have found him, and at that time he was sure that the dragon had seen him, and that he had not yet found him, and that no one had found him.
It's a risk.
He was convinced that Louis would never appear in the near future.
After they came back last night, they were busy checking, taking blood samples, they were both asleep and uncomfortable, after all very tired, plus the virus was slowly swallowing the body, they were both unable to eat.
Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss
"Aunt, has he been like this for a few days?
It's been five days, said Eve.
The little milk is very strange to such a beautiful city, purple eyes, as pure as a flower, which has not been environmentally polluted, has not been in the past a wickedness and a wickedness.
It's awful to see what he's doing now with his wife.
"Woman," you said, "I'm bad."
He wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He wasn't so...so... tender when he was three years old with Mommy.
Eve had a habit of moving his feet and touching his head.
Really? She washed with pure eyes.
Yee's face not red heart not jump, Of course, when did the wife deceive you?
Little Mermaid.
It's too...
It's clear.
He had to feel that's not like the ordinary.
"Aunt, can he find me?"
Little Milk doesn't care whether or not he hears it.
"He said he couldn't find it," said YV. "It's a big ice," she said, "and it looks like a cow.
Little Milk Pack
With another expression of grieving, holding Ying always bite, the small milk bag deeply felt unsuitable for children, went up to the laboratory.
"Nin, how come?"
"Isn't there an idea?
A glance at the heavy face of the little milk bag knows that things are not well, he is mentally prepared.
At this moment, someone sent the 1934 virus information, said the White Night, "I'll talk to you for a while.
He looked carefully at this information, the little milk bag curious, also in the past to look together, the su-1934 in the information is comprehensive, harm, the number of deaths, the government hard measures, at night the most concerned is his designer.

The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
Chapter 370
Knowing that was designed by Grandpa Suman in 1934, he immediately contacted Suman, and on the other side was very angry, very angry, staring at the little package, ten fingers long like a ghost would pinch the throat of the little package, and straightened him up.
11 Naturally knows why, very quietly laugh.
He looked at his wife with his soft lips and said, wife, how terrible!
Everybody nodded, really scary,
The three were afraid of their own sister eating their own son, this expression, not ordinary scary, everyone felt very scary.
Nobody but 11 knows why.
Aunt, What are you doing A A A A A A A A
"I hate you"
Ye's charming face turned into a ghost's grieving and resentment, the eyes had a bit of creeping,
What's he's talking about, there's a response from suman.
"Be quiet."
Suman's sounded like a morning wind blowing over the top of the mountain, with a refreshing, clean to the dust, it sounded like a high not to climb, not to be profaned.
"Well, Sue, I have something to do with you. Is it convenient to go online? I'll send you something.
Nine's voice was so urgent that when he called Suman for the first time, he forgot to call, and at this moment even his own aunt's grieving eyes were gone.
What's wrong?
"Yes, it's a life-saving thing."
No No No No No No.
Come on, I'm on line.
Suman did not ask, he said softly, Ninning just said a good word, and Ywei grabbed the phone, "So beautiful, have you seen me for a long time, have you thought of me?
It's quiet down there.
"Ive?"
"Why do you call it? It's enough to call it the slave.
Let's not look like that's what we've all been talking about.She's got a cell phone and she's laughing at what's called a buzz.
Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel
The coldness washed away in a moment, the eleventh, the white night, and the Ying at the same time, Ying just looked at the Ying at a glance and the gorgeous oblivious.
It's more than it is.
At that instant, all seemed to think that he was going to return to his former wickedness, but his eyes were still so clean, though full of murder, that there was no wickedness
With his fist, very sad, but without any real action.
They're relieved.
"I'm busy," said Suman. "I'm busy," he said.
The beauty of Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y
She wants tos a man, whoever the other, only to avoid, absolutely no level of playing the opponent can resist.
"She's not very interesting," she said, "and she's sent three words to the slaves."
Evey, holding the phone,,I'm not wasting my feelings for the sake of the slaves.
Chen and Chen smiled, and went to the small milk bag at night, and would have sent the information at night to Suman.
The Eleven pointed to the ghostlike ink, and Y was smiling, and asked, purely innocent, "Who deceived you, O White?
Tell your wife to help him.
It was also very interesting, with his finger pointed directly to YV, grievingly complained, "Woman, you have deceived me.
All of them.
Shen smiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I don't even know what a face is.
Eve laughed softly,You mean, I'll have to beat myself?
Mel stared at her, and ran to her, holding her sleeve, and cried, "Wow, who is he, who is he, and why are you so good to him?
You'll get him!
Eleven is a bit creepy.

And now I understand everything.
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
Later, if he returned to the previous he remembered the days when he was a great white.
A.
I'm afraid that's not enough for him. How cruel is this man! How can he be so good?
She's worried about her future.
Ying gently touched the face, laughed charming, " big white, how can you wrong the wife, he is hundreds of kilometers from me, how can not get, to get the wife also get you.
"Woman, you don't love.
Big White is good.
She had a poor look, and she was afraid that she had thrown him.
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
Don't fall in love with you!
You're a beauty.
"The wife..."
M M M M M M M M M M M M
Otherwise the old man beats you don't even recognize your brother.
All of them.
Miss Jiang and Mr Jiang weren't happy watching the play, and they looked at each other smiling, and they thought that the way the two of them got together was interesting, and Miss Jiang thought that the two extremes of the man were really challenging.
At first she had seen the wounds on Eve, and had been beaten to the point of intolerance, and the iron on her wrist had almost destroyed her hand, and it was from these wounds that she knew how cruel the man was.
Now it's really challenging to be so white, to rub and to rub and to rub.
Only a woman as brave as Y will survive him.
Their eyes were filled with tears, their delicate lips trembled and their leaves fell like autumn, and everyone around them was terrified.
For the first time, in contrast to the Yan who had been seen in the supermarket, the lips of the little cheerful be bent, "Aunt White, do you know who Sue is?
My Aunt's old lover Oh, my Aunt is very enthusiastic about him, and has been following people for a year.
This time I've got a way to contact Suman, but she doesn't, so Aunt is jealous of me.
As soon as she heard this, her eyes looked more sadly at her, and she stood up, angrily, and she was very handsome, and she was very brave to take off her sleeve.
Levy stared at...
O O O!
Come on, you're making up!
Look at her back. She's got a little bit of a temper.
Miss Cheung smiled softly, "Vy, you don't go to comfort, he is really attracted to hair.
Didn't he seem to be angry with you the first time?
From that day on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Where to leave, he fear leave a little unhappy to give him to run,
That's amazing.
The eleventh explanation is that Y has not only infected people with color, but also infected the temper.
After a wave of milk, laughed gracefully, raised a thumb at night, after all, to see the play of Yves, it was hard to get, some free screening, he naturally enjoyed watching.
Against him.
The Lady rose to the table, and went out with a great stride, and looked as if she had taken a sword.
"Aunt," said Suman. "Oh," said Suman.
The little bottle shouted behind her, and she seemed to not hear, and to not see at the blink of an eye.
Everyone laughed, and it was a good thing, but it was a very good thing, and a very strange thing.
They say little white and black are perfect. That's good.
Although this white is thorough.
Suman obviously had the information of 1934, and the analysis of this new virus, he himself is a virus expert, and look at these professional things too quickly.
SUMAN: You brought people.
Mother Max: Is There Any Help?
Suman:7.
Mother Max: Okay, I'll go right now.
Suman sent an address to the little milk, the night he remembered, he was a little curious, "Seventy per cent, is he sure? We have so many experts at our disposal, can he?
There's a lot to say, but look at the information, there's a seven-percent chance.
"Yes," said Suman. "Yes," said Suman. "Let's go," said Suman.
It will take a few hours to get here and come back soon, said the little milk.
It's an opportunity he doesn't leave any chance to heal his parents.
Miss Cheokokokokokokokokokokok
`I'll go,' said White Night, his face pale, and he could see no emotion, but only himself, how curious and enthusiastic he was.
CHAPTER 371 The Beautiful
There's always a power comparison between men. White Night is called a genius doctor. He's in trouble, and so many experts are in trouble with viruses.
The man at first said he had a seven, usually like a man like them, and at first said he had a seven, then changed the explanation, and saved.
It's amazing how strong this man really is.
Moreover, a high-speed magnetic pulse can open his eyes.
Suman's name is like Ray.
There was nothing to do with Ya, and it would not take much time to go, and since they were told that they had hope of being healed, they were not happy to come, and the plane was soon ready under the arrangement of peace and night.
The first terrorist organization was temporarily assigned to Clode, who at night let the experts in the laboratory continue to study the virus, and once the analysis reports were sent to them immediately, to avoid Suman repeating the study.
Everything was arranged in order, and hadn't taken into account Levy 11 and Levy, who knew that the plane was going to take off, Levy dragged Levy onto the plane, Levy onto the plane, and Levy onto the plane, she and Levy onto the plane.
Furthermore, it is possible to meet with.
"Aunt, what are you going to do?"
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
He also thinks he's going to give his mom and dad a cure for the virus.
"Why can't I go?
Soman and I haven't been talking for a long time.
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
Are you talking?
People are very suspicious, talking is not so stimulating, She is dreaming to hook up with Suman?
In fact, there is such a great beauty, Ye also remembered about Suman, the whole group is very nervous, what is it really a goddess, too charming.
Even the constantly over the top of the milk bag lifted Suman to the heart of the mouth.
Take a look again, just on the face sleeve away, very brave, the atmosphere is very good, how to turn the eye again is a wife murder is also a reasonable wife slave, holds Eve not to shake hands, is a typical wife what is not brave.
Isn't this change too big?
Xiao and White White said, Big White, are you jealous?
She was holding her, pointed at her head, with a pure face, seemingly not to be jealous.
Ye, once again, said he was so rare, that he was not so good at Miss.
Occasionally hanging Miss to see her own throwing of rose leaves is addictive.
Jia also raised her thumb, "The trainer has the skill, Vivi, when there is no teaching two ways.
All right, I'll make sure you're all right.
Miss Li pulls the process, laughs very dangerous, very angry, " Little Anna, I'm not good enough for you, you also learn what the trainer calls,
I'm not satisfied. I'll change my husband.
The little milk was shaking, and he and the white night went together.
Take a look at the eleven eyebrows, Y smiled, "It's sour, brother, what do you eat at noon, don't bring such a threat, you'll be so good as big white, the three sisters will be better to you, more gentle.
He had to be as white as the ink, and it was estimated that Miss Cheung would be more able to oppress him than Eve, and he did not.
Besides, he didn't dress ink so purely not polluted, let go.
That's what I think.
Miss Cheung thinks it's very reasonable, she thinks that's what she expects, that's what she expects, that's what she expects.
Come, my dear, and look at me with a smile.
The three little lip corners shake.
The wind was the same as the leaves. He learned ten to ten things. He felt that his wife must be more than two hundred meters away from his sister, so as not to get hurt.
Levy laughed in her arms, even 11's lips could not lift, a bit of laughter.
The little bottle washed over the eyes, said the child, Mother, the watch is so stimulating, is not suitable for children,
You also have to take care of such a pure heart.
All of them.
Pure?
Do you want purity or darkness?
She smiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I love you.
The little bottle fell deeply on the shoulder of the white night, expressing comfort, "It is indeed too terrible, to mourn for you in the future.
White Night, Chu, and others long suffered from Ye Wei, 11's bullying, long had a relative, now to meet Miss Zhang's evil hobby, is that people will feel women very scary.
White Night also returned to the shoulder of the small milk bag, as well as expressed condolences, "I too for you after twenty years.
Excuse me, I don't need it.
The little bottle smiled, and the man who wanted to be poisoned was gone, and nothing was left.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
Miss Cheung had a smile on her ears when she heard that, her heart felt heavy, and at one point she did not know what to say to the little milk bag, but looked at him deeply.
The others did not expect No to go up there, still joking, the three of them were a family, already very mature, and on the night of the pain of the small milk, although indifferent to the people, but he grew up with the others, and the emotions were good,
There was a lot of talk between nature and the leaves, and the atmosphere was still very lively, and there was nothing to worry about the virus.
Everyone's anxious. He can't be anxious.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Eve kicked her foot, and when the ice had learned to see her play, it had to be played.
In fact, she thinks the two plays are not worth.
Don't say she's curious, Miss Li and the little milk bag are all curious, with several eyes fixed on her.
She said,Suman is not like me, she has abandoned Suman, not abandoned me, I am the original.
All of them.
The cold people like Ra 11 were shaken, more to say, Cheng Yan and others.
Vivi, you can say this, it's true...
It's awful.
"Brother White," said Vivi, "I'm sure that's an absolute falsehood, and you can believe that she's excited when she hears Susan."
After many years of oppression, it is not easy to get the chance to return, naturally fear the world is not disturbed.
The Small Pack also expresses doubt.
With a blank eye, looking at the look of the heads of all, and looking at Y, pulling Y Y's sleeve, asked, "Woman, will you deceive me?"
"No," she said. "The beauty is light, and her face is not changed."
She said she wouldn't cheat on me.
It's awful that white ink can be taught to be like this by Eve.
The little milk bag laughed very happy.
As a male compatriot, white night respects ink to a hundred.
She was lying on her shoulder, laughing and shaking. This man is so cute.
Miss Cheung wasted her time, saying that you don't have to make a distinction, is not a typical little white rabbit.
"Vyvy," she said, "it's your trick."
"The three sisters have won."
The two women smiled, Miss Chang looked at the leaves, the spine of the leaves, the hair of the bones, the gray of the correction,
There is a lot of little Anya's wicked interests, and it is seen that it is definitely one of the ways to die.
Little Anna, stop the strange picture in your mind, I and him are not a dish.
Ying made a statement at once.
M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M
Levy laughed,My brother, our house is more tender than yours, it is delicious, it is pure from the outside.
This is absolutely true.
Miss Chen smiled more gently,Your brother doesn't even know how to write two pure words.
And the little milk, Mother, if you feel uncomfortable, try to get out of the wall.
She's a beauty.
Be careful the old man killed you.
If she could hit a man at this moment, she would have gone to the spoon behind the small milk bag, and she would have liked to have said one thing, So-Bein was a slave, but she would have wisely swallowed the words back, without any prejudice to the pure white face of So-Bein.
Looking at the oppressed two male compatriots, the night feels alone is really good, the sun shines, the life is good.
"What are you talking about, wife?"
She asked with sincerity.
"Well, I agree with what you just said," said Jian, "she's better than Suman, and she's the world's first to grow up like that."
There are no pairs in the world, she has never seen such a beautiful person, if a woman, sure to give to man a fairy all the shock, especially a pair of purple eyes like water, more than a little charm.
Even though he is now as pure as white paper, but with a smile charm, no one can be compared.
Ye did not comment on this, but laugh.
Little Anna, do you dare to be a man, do you not want to live?
Le 3 n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n
Miss Cheokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokok
You really don't look like that.
As the little bottle touched his chin thought, I'm also curious about what Suman looks like, Aunt, really?
Ask 11.
Ye waved hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand
The Eleven looked at Ming and said, Each has a thousand autumns.
"That should be the man of heaven.
The Little Milk.
Huang Yang looked at the jade in front of the milk bag and wondered, "My dear, what are you wearing
Are you falling?
Isn't this girl thing? Her son doesn't always wear this thing.
The little bottle smiled, the pain flashed, instantly returned to calm, he just to answer, to help him with the ink, "It's my Nono.
It's a little dark.
It is not known to any of the three orphans or to the three orphans.
If the little cherry had been left unattended outside, the expression was calm, not to see any sadness, not to see any despair, but many years later, Jiang An-ya remembered the scene again did not know.
There's a quietness called dead water.
"It's good," said Cheng, softly, "I'm going to take a look at you."
"Well, I think it looks good too."
Looking at the scenes of their joy, he remembered Nono, who would not sleep at night, afraid that one night he would dream of her again, but when he awakened, he could only catch the regret that remained in the air, and not sleep at night.
These feelings, he experienced too early, he felt more in the heart.
As time settles, this memory becomes more and more clear, firmly printed in the mouth, slowly add to the print, no longer erased, life as a shadow, he keep this memory for life, and no repentance.
There was a silence on the shoulders of the little milk, but the three knocked on the table, "Don't, don't you take a fool home?
To meet the brave to get away from, do not listen to the loss?
Miss Miss.
It's too early for this love enlightenment.
The little milk bag with ten hands, puts out the most venerable gesture and expression, "The wise God-bearer, the little boy must follow the teaching, no more dare.
Everyone laughed.
The atmosphere was once again, Cheng Ya smiled, and said nothing more, but the heart was very pained, and he looked at her with this kind of bold smile, and was very touched.
The airplane landed on a private deck, a vast estate, like a desert, with vast palm trees and palm trees, and in the center of the garden a well-built fountain.
In the courtyard of the elegant villas, there is a variety of strange plants, and the estate is ancient, and there is a thick historical taste, and in the bend of the corridor hangs a crystal lamp of the petals of the flower, which is exceptionally beautiful.
came to meet their maid a black robe, a black head, a black sand, a typical Arab woman dressed,
Take them all the way to the hall.
Eva greeted them with a pleasant smile, and one of them laughed in English, "The master is having a headache again.
It was very hot in the summer, but the hall was very cool, and according to the observations of the night, he found that the walls were made of ice, and there was nothing to see on the surface, but it was very cold to touch,
This is a special design to reduce summer heat.
Don't worry.
Their walls are made of ice.
Eve and eleven had lived here for a long time, and it was unfamiliar, and Eve automatically to take the fruit on the table thirsty.
It's awful hot summer in Riyadh, it's hot air, it's dry.
Shortly afterwards, the maids brought their ice-creams and their fruit desserts, because they knew the tastes of the leaves and the eleven, and prepared for them both two glasses of blue-green fruit.
"I didn't think you remembered my love," said Eve in Arabic.
Diana smiled and said, The Master is receiving the Prince of the Seven, and will come in a moment.
Doesn't it look good?
Ye is very gossip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dana's big eyes are smiling, "You don't look good.
Ye is successful.
You're too stubborn, sister.
He shook his head at her shoulder at night.Can your family hear Arabic?
You've got to get the inside out before you hook up.
Keep the backyard from burning.
Levy, having forgotten this, said in Arabic to Mr. White, my drink is not good, let us change.
She was very clever to change hers and hers, and her eyes immediately stopped, "No, I suddenly feel good to drink.
This guy understands.
Little Milk laughed, and explained to Cheng Anya again, that these people did not understand the Arabic, and that she did not understand the foreign languages, English, Japanese, and French.
Shortly afterwards, someone outside shouted at the master, and he saw a steadfast figure slowly walking into the eyes of the people, with a white robe and a light and quiet faintness around him.
It is an unholy purity.
Yang's first feeling is that's a beauty!
There was only one thought.
The beauty smiles.
CHAPTER 372
Suman, a tall man, dressed like an Arab, with white robes, black crowns, white scarves, and with white robes, long hair bound with silver ribbons.
A thin, long, like a long mountain, a pair of dark, bright eyes, like the springs of the mountains, with a slight cleanness in the cold, looked like the wind blowing on the ice, cold, stiff.
His nose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
All man gives man a sense of arrogance, coldness, and highness, which cannot be profaned.
It is not wrong to think of a woman, because it is a man who is extremely confident and strong, a woman's family, who will have this kind of force, and this kind of forgiveness, which is only my self-esteem.
White,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This appearance was absolutely one hundred per cent brilliant man, he stood there, the whole world seemed to be accompanied, he became the only light, the whole hall, no one man or woman, no man, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
But as soon as he came out, a silence, was shaken by this beauty, even to see the familiar with his beauty, Ye Wei and 11 were shaken, and some are not tired of how to see, how to see, he still as at first sight.
Suman's eyes were sweeping the men and women of the hall; he had been accustomed to the brilliant eyes of others; his eyes were on the small chest of milk; his lips were not often smiling, and he lifted them a little.
Come on, come on, come on.
Sweetie,the slaves want to kill you.
Eve was the first to respond, not even to the vinegar, to the shadow of jumping, to offer to embrace, Eve was the first killer, the body moves very fast, but someone faster than her.
As she moved, and as soon as she moved, she held her waist to the side, and the five coloured officers were filled with protest.
This is a woman.
Suman's eyebrows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I don't think of you at all," said Suman, his eyes cold, his voice soft, and his smell clean.
Worship the twelve, and if you can live with her, you must indeed worship her, otherwise how many people under heaven will be harmed by her.
"You're not nice," said Sue.
Eve protested, clapping white hands, indicating that he could let go. It was a very foolish decision to take him, unless there was no man in the castle to take him, she really did not want to take him.
"Suman," the little milk came, touching his lower jaw, "you are so unlikely."
Although I've heard of very human, but when I met know, really human, sophisticated, charming.
You too, little man.
Suman patted on his shoulder, with a soft look, "What's the matter with Eve?
Eve did not do it at first.What do you mean, Sue?
Truth is, I hate you.
She's my aunt.
"The world is small.
Suman's always cold eyes also flashed helplessly, turning and turning it is a group of people.
The little milk was introduced to them all, because Cheng Anja and Ye Three had little virus in them, and the two were just nodding, and Suman was not always happy to communicate with people, just as he was in his heart, nodding was a greeting, and so it was to the White Night.
"Well, how do you see so many people sick?" Suman said coldly, and all felt that there was a kind of invisible pressure spreading, and that it was someone who had such a spirit, that a simple word could have the effect of deterrence.
Miss Cheung, who seems to be a bit of a genius, is always a bit of a temper, of course, with the exception of their baby, anyway, they are both sure to come,
The rest don't care about them.
I don't think you don't?I don't know you don't have me.
"Yeah," he said.
Oh, are you sorry you didn't deserve to be a slave?
Eve smiled and touched Suman's arm, "Woman, do you really not want to be a slave?"
"I don't want," said Suman, with his cold eyes turned, and his eyes were filled with bitterness.
"Woman, don't do this. I'll be happy if you hug me."
All of them.
All the others had excuses, he said lightly at night, "Their two viruses are mine, and perhaps I can help.
"No," said Suman with a cold, convergent, fierce spirit.
The light night breezes, but as if there were a layer of frost between the eyebrows, and gently out of the heaviness, believe me, you will need.
Their eyes were touched together, one elegant, one cold and arrogant, and the spirit was not allowed to pass, and the people felt only a kind of pressure, extremely oppressive.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
You're not so good,but he's better than you are.
"I want the latest analysis," said Suman.
No No No No No.
Suman's eyes turned a little, and left him in the laboratory, and the rest of the people were not allowed to follow him, and all the people listened, and remained in the hall, said he at night.
said 11,He hadn't given a good look to the identity of Vivi and me at first.
"Oh, Vivi, how are you, but...
"The taste has changed a lot," he said, laughing.
She didn't understand what White had to say, and the little milk was smiling, and the eleven were inclined, and Y was waving, and she was speechless.
"It's an accident..."
"Is he an Arab?" he asked with curiosity at night.The Suman Five had an Arabian depth, and an Oriental depth, which was more like an Oriental in general.
His mother was an Arab, His father was a Chinese, a mixed-breed.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
Levy leaned on a chair to drink ice and said slowly, You know why the slaves are up to the heart, So beautiful from the outside to the inside, you know, hard to see real man.
It's a pity people don't see her. According to inside news, Suman doesn't like women like men, so she's out of the game.
"Aunt, your charm is gone."
"The little boy," he said, "look at this man, who's lost his way to the north.
Where did it fall?
Levy pointed at the side of the ink, laughed at the charm, her charm shines to the ink.
"Woman," she asked, "you don't say he doesn't look like me, have you abandoned him before? Why do you want to be close to him?Womanman, you are lying to me."
Remembering is normal. Embracing is a basic ritual.
She hasn't gone to hug.
White Night and the little milk, the eleven cold hum, said Ye Wei very cooperative, "Do you see the eleven the ice hug who?
Don't want to live to hold her, how can you have a wife and eleven?
Fire and ice can't be pulled together.
"Woman, you'll be just like the eleven, without being too enthusiastic.
With my eyes lowered, in my depressedness, my purple eyes became dim, and there was no light.
Levy wasted her mind, and she was a little... uncomfortable with the manner in which she had always behaved, and, moreover, Suman was not interested in her, and she was a little bored, and there was nothing much to it.
"Vyvy, have you noticed that he seems to be getting smarter.
suddenly said,especially these days, it feels very obvious, not as it was at the beginning as white paper, what Ye Wei said.
Levy nodded. There was another concern. Was he going to recover soon?
Or?
Big White, did you remember anything? asked Ye, softly, with her head shaking, 11 and Ye looked at each other and did not speak.
Maybe it's a mistake!
"Woman, if you do this again, I will kill him."
Big White, go. I'll take you to see the sights of Riyadh.
Sheaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
This is a small study room.
Since Suman is a virus expert, the home laboratory has the most complete research equipment in the world, although the sparrows are all five dirty, look past, are test tubes, test agents, automatic equipment, computer graphic analysis, huge LCD screen.
Suman took the blood of the two, and injected them separately with two different colours, and there were only three, and the three leaves were not taken into account, and asked quietly, "Sir Su, can this virus really be solved?"
While Suman wasting his time on a system check, he said softly, "Maybe, maybe not, and I don't have the full idea, you have to see how the virus is unstable."
There was also one ready, looking at Cheng, smiling slightly, Che Chengng, smiling back at him, living and dying to their place, seems not to be so important.
Suman took a look at the perfect, perhaps because he had a good relationship with Nine, he had a good feeling for them, and his attitude was very gentle, after all, he could raise children like a small milk carton, and his parents would not be lazy.
Moreover, in the last few months, the events, the rumours, the world, quite dramatic, Suman knows that they are quiet parents, naturally also concern, and feels quite interesting.
Now to see them can face life and death, in the heart to appreciate.
"You call me Suman."
Suman's voice was always clear, and there was no emotion.
Chen, smiling, as he examined, and as he talked, asked, "Soman, how do you know Ning Ning?"
"It's a coincidence that he wants a picture of the weapon.
I didn't want to, who knows the computers at home are all black, I can't just compromise, I don't agree, I'm afraid he's even the nationality for free to help me change, wake up to be a national, say uncertain identity card spouse column will jump out a name.
said Suman.
Her parents,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My son's behavior is really...
You robber!
It was his son, thought Ying, and though it was dangerous, it was the most effective.
You're so miserable.
Miss Cheung shut up for half an hour, shut up for such a word, and at the exit regret, normally not as a parent, what do they have to apologize?
Miss!
"Well," I said, "I'm sorry."
Miss Cheung's attachment to the little milk bag had reached its limit.
"It's a good thing to happen occasionally. My son uses a lot of it.
Ye said, I don't feel any shame at all for the actions of the little packets, but I feel rather glorious.
"Yes," admitted Suman with a glance.
Miss Cheung and Miss Ying were a little successful, and Miss Yinging was very good, but it didn't matter how to know, it mattered that they were now forgetting their relationship,
Isn't that nice?
Suman checked for Miss Chang, his eyelids slightly raised, his cold eyes slightly passed, "I'm sure that's not the nature that's passed down, it's the nature that's passed down.
Thirty.
Miss
"But you're all right about one thing," said Suman, letting Miss Suman get up, and letting Miss Suman lie down.
When Suman checked the leaf, looking at the pictures and the information on the screen, his eyes sank, because it was Arabic, Chen did not understand, but the pictures were clear, it was the liver.
"It's a bit of a problem.
Suman.
With anxious forethought, "What's going on?
Isn't it saving?
"The virus has penetrated the liver. He is more serious than you are.
Mr Suman was telling the truth, he felt they were strong enough to bear the news, and he did not hide, "It's a cell virus, and once it invades the liver, the body will be severely depressed, and in less than a day, it will not be able to move freely, and it will only be able to survive in the laboratory with sedatives and oxygen masks.
Cheng Yan's eyes opened for a moment, the color faded, only felt the heart is sore, even the head is sore, a blank,
No matter what,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
She had a strong feeling that she was about to lose her leaves.
"Soman, what do you do?" "Soman, what do you do?" "Soman, what do you do?" "Soman, what do you do?" "What do you do?"
She reached out to hold her hand, and the cold touched her, and though she looked at death and death, she was sure that when the sun and the sun were gone, there would be pain and despair.
"Don't worry, little Anne," she said, "there's no hope."
He said softly, We're all talking, aren't we?
"The consequences are worse than I thought," he said, "and I'll do everything I can."
Suman said quietly, with his cold eyes fixed, "I'd rather ask him for something than ask him for anything.
Cheung Anya's mind wasted, somehow, Suman's speech is always to be believed.
"What about her?
"She's fine," said Suman. "She's in control for the time being," she said. "She's the first strain, and the virus is much more stable than you are, so she's in good shape.
"Why? I'm more addicted than he is.
It doesn't have much to do with poisoning.
"The instability of this type of cell virus is not so strong," Suman explained, "and the second-wave virus amplifies on the basis of its instability, making it easier for mutations to occur."
Joan did not really know about the virus, but when she saw Suman's sternness, her heart was healed, but she was not anxious or sad, and she accepted the bad news calmly.
"Yes, Suman, the designer of 1934 is your grandfather, and the principle of the night is similar to this
Are there any cures?
Soon asked.
Suman nodded, with a cold eye, almost untouchable, "It was studied by my grandfather when he was young, when my grandfather had liver cancer, and my grandfather studied cell viruses only to cure liver cancer.
It was locked in a laboratory, and no one knew, because he knew the dangers of the virus researched, but was stolen out by the students into the hands of illegals, causing the death of tens of thousands of people throughout Siberia, he regretted,
Afterwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although the same principle, this section is obviously more complicated, at present I have only an approximate idea, it must be confirmed before dare to test on you.
Li looked at Suman and smiled quietly, "You let go, I believe you.
The wife, I can't see him
Suman had a detailed inspection of the younger and the younger, and as the evening approached, he remained in the laboratory to prepare the information, and had the maids take them and the younger and the younger to the house.
Little Milk was waiting for them in the room for a longer time than in Rome. Little Milk was anxious and afraid of what would happen. If Suman had said nothing, it would have been estimated that no one in the world would have been able to save them.
As soon as they came back, their faces looked very pale, and the little chew washed up in their hearts, and they hurried forward, and the little chew was afraid that one would accidentally touch him, and that drinking would take him away, and the little chew was unwilling to leave a safe distance.
"Dad, Mum, you're all right," said Suman.
Little Milk was in a hurry, waited for an afternoon, lost patience, now only to hear the good news, even though he knew it was very little.
Shen Ya didn't hide from him, she said, but she didn't show the fear in her little chest.
"There's the world's best cow doctor and the world's best virus expert," he said.
Leth smiled a little, the little bottle showed calm, very great wind, he thought not only at the first time, that the child's performance, and not panic, but also busy to comfort the way father.
But...
Don't worry too much about what to do. If you believe in them, then believe in the end.
Whatever the result, I and your mother will accept.
Don't put on your face, it's awkward, your mommy's not dead yet.
Miss Cheung waved at her son's face, looking at her discomfort.
Impressed, her son must have been graceful and lovely, tightening her face in disbelief.
"You know," said the little milker, with his pink lips filled with discontent. "In any case, you must not leave me.
Miss Cheung smiled,I can't tell who just said,the best doctors and the best virus specialists are here,and it's going to be okay.How can you say no so quickly?
Don't have confidence?
Mummy, don't you break the baby like this. The little milk bag stared, and the little gentleman expressed dissatisfaction.
Miss Cheung smiled at Ying.
Little Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann
Mr. Le proposed that, because of his business relationship, he had come to Riyad twice, but that he had come and gone in a hurry, and had not come and looked at the beauty of the city, but had been impressed only by the night view of Riyad.
It's not enough to have a trip with three of us, it must feel good.
Besides the last time at the sea, their family has not traveled, nor knows he has not the opportunity to enjoy the warmth of a three.
He is very cherished.
"My baby," said Suman, "the specialty here is very well known," the little milk bag smiled gracefully, and cast a vote in favour, and the black eyes showed childishness.
The three little nod, to the son than good gesture, the father smiled at both.
Cheng Anya hesitated, her bright eyes were filled with fear, and she remembered the pain, which could not be expressed in words, which was very painful.
We're not good for the streets. Don't go.
She'd like to, said Ji, but things aren't allowed. There's always a physical collision in the street.
It's unthinkable to have a virus.
That's right too.
Even if the streets were wide, it would be safe to go to the streets of Riyadh.
Miss
Small Package
Don't set a bad example to your baby, Daddy.
Leth smiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The little bottle touched the nose and turned to smile, said one sincerely, Father, this is not the thing to say,
It's still important.
When Jian looked at the father, she was very cute.
Don't do that. drive. we don't get out of the car.
Joan laughed, baby, look, your old man is going to start a hard day tomorrow, you will have to work harder.
"Obey! "The little milk bag has a kind of military service.
Ye and Ming were not happy, and one afternoon disappeared, and when they had dinner, Suman came out of the laboratory, and the two men came up high, and Minginging one wife screamed so that all felt the food was very sweet.
There was a seat reserved for the two, and when they came they sat down, and the maid gave them food and drink, and when they went out at noon, the big white looked unhappy, but now he was glad, and his cheeks were red, and he seemed lovely.
Eleven, pulling Eve,,You got him? Didn't find anything?
In terms of compromise, Ye and the eleven best, the two did not even communicate eye to eye to know what the other did in a short time, Ye Ye shook his head, "all normal.
Because of their special relationship, Ye, no matter how they feel about, whether they love, they have a defense against him, no matter what they do, they must not interfere with the whole thing, so they are careful and normal.
It's just that's a fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake
Don't talk about strangers.
Her mind, always uncertain, how others see her is like the past, not half, and it is for this reason, the leaves and the white night to reassure her to see the ink.
What about my sister-in-law
Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y
"Good," said Suman, "and I'm not going to do anything about it."
"Aunt," said the little milk, "you're all happy. Remember my mother?"
Little children, eat more, talk less.
"Aunt," said Aunt, "have you been deceived?"
Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel Mel
Every man, with his eyes, could see that it was no good.
Suman washed away the food in his dish, picked up the cold eyebrows slightly, and his eyes fell on his face, because he sat on the opposite side, and it seemed not strange that he could see with his eyes.
Strangely enough, Suman had seen it many times, and all were, except that the rest had felt.
Suman's sexuality, as Eve and Eleven know, was mentioned once on the plane.
Miss Chen's usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's awful for both men, especially now that the eyes are pure, the face is like a peach, the eyes are like a peach, the lips are like a peach, and it's a very good pet to have.
It was amusing for him to see that Y was not tired.
Soon in the minds of all flew out a very intertwined triangle of love, and the woman looked at the woman, and the woman looked at the woman, and the woman looked at the woman, and the woman looked at the woman, and the woman had pursued the woman for more than a year, and this time she had come running with the woman.
I didn't expect to bring me, but in a strange way to add to the enemy, the enemy called himself a wife.
Everyone is now thinking, how sad Eve should be.
The little bottle of ice coconut, the dark eyes turned and turned, floating on his aunt and his great-aunt, Suman, the more cunning the more cunning.
Levy slowly put down his fork, laughing at the so-called all kinds of mood, the single knife straight into, "So beautiful, do you see my house big white?
Suman looked calm, didn't pick up his eyebrows, talk.
She looked innocently at Y, afraid of Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y
Silence.
Miss Cheung took the tablecloth very gently, almost lying laughing on the table, the three little corners of the eye, laughing and feeling very thin, after all, Suman is the master, they are the guests.
The little bottle is drink coconut, is squeezed, turns in a direction, is still coughing.
"Haha"
"In a strange silence, the only one who laughed at the filming of the night, he was lively, indifferent to people, and this was the first time that he was in such a state of disbelief," said Suman.
As if he didn't know what he had done, he looked around innocently, "What is the matter with you?
Levy touched the head, comfort, she was deceived so many times by the Suman, never won one, not thought by the Suman as soon as the face of the face of the Suman.
Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good
It's all right, big white, you've done a good job, and it's worth it.
Eve great praise, Ming heard the wife praise, naturally smile not close the mouth.
"Vyvy," she said, "you've taught me a great thing."
Levy smiled and cried with a belly, Su, don't be ashamed, too. If you are thinking of a kiss for the slaves, the slaves will also be thinking of giving you a big hug.
All of them.
Lucky for you don't have anything to drink, Auntie, but you are strong.
Ye muster the feeling that had a sister, that his life would be perfect.
Miss Chen thought that her name was indeed a change, she had been conscious.
Suman's eyes were still cold, and his lips had a curve that could not be said to be a laugh, as if the autumn had been cleared, and the man's tone was flat, without any disturbance.
He is not a complete individual.
There was stillness.
Ying smiled and looked at ther, "Have you touched such a case?
"I did it a few years ago."
"Why is it?
"How do I know?" answered Suman, not coldly.
Levy washed her face, Sue, don't behave so rudely.
"I'd have been so rude.
Even if it's true, you don't have to be so straightforward.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
She still doesn't know what they are talking about.
"I don't know," said Suman.
Didn't you say there were cases?
The three leaves are also curious.
"It's not a disease," said Sue. "I don't know," she said.
Eleven is most interested in the other thing, can heal?
"I don't know."
How do you know when you ask three?
said White.
Levy glanced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Suman's cold eyes swept through the night.I'm afraid I don't know what to ask.
Everyone's silent. So beautiful. You're dead.
He's not a disease, he's not a normal, he's not a professional, he doesn't make any comparisons.
Suman Tea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
They laughed, and took a drink of red wine, and the people were silent.
It's awful.
Have you never heard of a complete individual?
It's more than talk. He's clearly a living man.
CHAPTER 374
After dinner, he drove away with Anya and a small pack of milk, and Sumanben wanted to have one as a guide, and he refused, and, while he was unfamiliar, he had a son who could never be lost.
He didn't want anybody to ruin the sweet time of their family.
The night scenery of Riyad is indeed very beautiful, away from the desert city flying a dozen years ago, now the skyscrapers of Riyadh, the streets are wide and bright, the city lights are lit, the whole city lights are lit, the feeling of a light sea.
As the car slowly passed through the city most belonged to the fountains, two fountains can be seen in a few streets, each with different designs, each with different sizes, and each with more cooling than the hot summer days.
"The Sahara is mostly in Saudi Arabia, and every green area in Riyadh has to be maintained manually, at a huge cost," said Leth, smiling. "These fountains are only for regulating the temperature of the city.
It was too hot for her, too. In the daytime, in Suman's residence, there was ice everywhere, and it was very cool. But as soon as I went out, there was a lot of heat, and Levy laughed and told her that 40 was the normal temperature, and that 45 was the hottest.
She understands why the streets of Riyadh are so empty, and normal people do not go out for a walk and a stroll at more than 40 degrees in the day and at more than 30 degrees in the night, and that is absolutely to blame.
There were too few people on the streets to take photographs when they were looking at no one, and though they were all hot and sweated, they were laughing, and they did not know that there was a storm over the Suman residence.
Suman went back to the laboratory after dinner, filled up with 1934 drug data, continued to study viruses, and the whole Noda laboratory was alone with him, and he was not surprised when Yves came.
How about a good night with you, So beautiful, So sweet, So soft, So boneless, So soft, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet, So sweet.
Suman didn't blink, first, about himself, he wasn't as big as Y, but, second, the scenes of such embrace were too much, and he too was paralyzed.
Men's ink and silver belt, elegant, slowly tos down the rolls in his hand, cold pressed the eyes of the man on Eve, at least to dress professionally.
Levy laughed in silence, and took a look at Suman, and the more he had, the more he had, and the more he had, and the more he had, and the more he had, and the more he had.
"You know," he said.
Suman clapped her hand.
When will you be able to feel a lot of softness When will you be able to feel a lot of softness When will you be able to feel a lot of softness When will you be able to feel a lot of softness When will you be able to feel a lot of softness When will you be able to feel a lot of softness When will you be able to feel a lot of softness When will you be able to feel a lot of softness
"You didn't ask.
Suman grinned, indicating her rise. He hated such close contact with a woman.
Levy, with a grin around Suman's neck, Sue, if you're telling the slaves that you like men, that the slaves were changing sex for you, and now we're sure to be gods, you'll be breaking up a beautiful marriage,
Do you have to have a slave?
Suman wasted no time on YV's inconsistency, on the one hand, and on the other, reaffirming that is the nature of truth, on the other, "I don't like you, either, because you've become a man.
"Beautiful, don't take people with such a sex."
Why can't the beauty, Ye is very confused.
Don't let the old one down!
"Don't worry about something, I'm busy.
Suman washed, and the kind of non-violent and powerful spirit spread through the room, if the ordinary man had already been frightened by the softness of his legs; if it had been for Eve, it would have been no use at all, for she had experienced a more appalling atmosphere.
Do you know what I am looking for you garlic?
"Well, you're not going to turn the corner," he said. "You're not going to turn the corner again.
When Suman saw blood, though Eve had been with him for more than a year, he did not understand that there were many jokes.
After all, he accepted the two friends of Yev and 11, otherwise how could they have stayed at home so long, even if they were stronger, he would have driven the two men away, more or less.
What was I liked him? Levy admitted, with her heart uncovered, without any embarrasment or shyness at all, and she took a shot at Suman's chest, "Is he like that, two, or one?
"What do you think?
Suman replied,What do you care about?
"He's a black man, probably the man behind Louis, and what do I like about him?"
"I'm not sure," she said, with a smile. "It's just a plot."
Suman looked up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It's a reasonable conclusion," said Eve, leaning down from the side of the chair. "I've counted people all my life, but I'm not going to be counted.
You're done, said Suman softly, with the warmth of an ice fountain, You love him.
Levy's smiled a little cruelly and aggressively, " Sue, do you think I should kill him?
Suman smiled,,I'm sure you won't let go.
"Laughter, I can't kill anyone in the world?"
YV also smile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm sure."
Suman said in silence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don't say two, you can't go anywhere.
Levy waved, aren't you, I, you, 11, White Night, who of us isn't like that?
It's the same thing as before.
Susan looked at her, not speaking, and her dark eyes had a fearful penetration, and saw that Eve was a little disturbed, "You really don't know when he will be well
"I don't know," he said, "but there's no such thing as an example," and "even if I've met one, there's no such thing as an example of another."
Suman speaks.
Is there any way to keep him white forever?
What do you mean?
Let him do it forever.
Ye, it is not possible.
"You're too demanding," said Suman, with a very cold tone. "Now this sub-sexuality is a temporary occurrence, which doesn't last long. It's the original, it's the essence. Don't mess with it, it's like real and virtual.
"I don't care," I said. "Is there a way for him to keep it?"
She didn't like the present more than the old one, and she didn't know what the old one was, but she was worried that once the old one had returned, they were both over.
If it is, it is better to keep it.
Would you rather keep an empty shell?
Suman wondered that was not Eve, whom he knew to be unintelligent, and who would have taken such an extreme step for a man.
It's not an empty shell, but it's so cute now.
"No," said Suman adamantly, "the virtual soul will devour the original for too long in his body, and he will die in the end."
Levy's eyebrows twisted.
Will you die?
She breathed a little, her mouth pressed like a stone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Soman, I have a very unfortunate premonition," "that he is dead, that I am dead," "What do you say?"
"Do you want him or you?
"No," said the old man, "I'm not going to die."
That's the end?
Suman replied.
"OK," said Levy, with a smile on her face, "I understand."
Turn around and go out of the lab.
As soon as she went out, she came in the night, and Suman's eyes were dim, cold as a sword, as cold as iron, "What are you going to do?
There's the latest virus analysis over in Rome.
White Night answered lightly, looking at the direction of Eve, Are you sure you are not good at batting
"The duck would have played well. "
In the night,
Eve, sitting alone in the court, silent, had known not to go to Suman, the heart is extremely heavy, she has never been so hesitant in her life, looking at the moon, Eve's heart feels more restless.
M M M M
What should she do with him?
It's not clear what she's thinking now, and if she's back to her old, then they're not going to fight again.
When she thought of the pictures of the two men who killed you and me in the past, she was filled with a sense of helplessness.
If he had been white, it would have been unfair to them, and even life would have become fictitious, as Suman said.
It's what Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y
She won't behave towards the enemy, even if the enemy is a mermaid.
Kill him?
Don't go down?
Susan had a clear eye and could see everything, and if she had a fight with Meron, she would have done her best, but if she had killed him, she wouldn't have done it.
The beach was a living example.
If she were to kill him, she would not be able to kill him if she had returned to her previous life.
Kill, huh?
Levy wasted a moment.
It's a problem.
On a hot day, What are you wearing here? 11 beat her shoulder and sat by her side, Want to kill her?
"You're really the worm in my belly," Levy laughed. "I'm not trying to kill him.
One time the tiger returned to the mountain, almost killed her three brothers and her family, now that the virus in the lee three young and Cheng Anya did not know whether to dissolve, the small milk, though people are safe, Connono died, he also died.
If she had been on the beach at first, and had heard the eleven, and had killed the brothers of May, then nothing would have happened, and Louis would have taken them away, easy to say.
Now, she felt very clearly that was not right, the feeling in her heart was heavier and heavier, and all the spears were pointed at the brothers of the墨 family, and the墨 was by her side, and this was a good opportunity, and if it were lost, she would have no chance of killing the墨 for the rest of her life.
Their iniquity should be ended by them.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
"I can't say anything," said coldly. "You'll decide for yourself," said coldly.
"That's it."
Eve laughed, and in her heart, "It is true, so pure ink, how can I go to the hand?
"No," he said.
Vivi,you're really too deep.
There's been no news for so many days, and where did he go? said Ye Wei, and it's so unusual and worrying, that you said at the first time on the beach, he had almost lost his gun and his life, and now he's in our hands, and he's no trace. Isn's something strange about him, he's no reason to care for him.
"I'm surprised, too.
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
As murderers, their feelings are most sensitive.
Eve and 11 looked at each other, and did not speak at all, and the two sat again, and Eve returned to the house.
She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She hadn't seen She
Levy sat down smiling at his lips, What to play?
"Game."
"I've got the monster," said Mr, giving her a look at what she had done.
It was a game, and she was relaxed, and the little fool, she looked at the ink, the color of the face, the pure smile.
It's like a child.
Who's really going to hurt a child?
Wife, why are you looking at me? She felt her eyes, paused the game, asked curiously, eyes are a little blank, what is the wife at all?
"It's all right," said Levy, leaning on the bed.
This little fool, how can his eyes be so pure?
"Woman, are you not very sad?"
She was lying next to Y, her eyes were a little sharp, "Who deceived his wife, tell big white, big white shattered him whole.
Angel.
"It's only the wife who cheats, and no one cheats the wife."
Ye Yang, Where do I look sad?
You know what hurts?
What's the heart?
"You look sad."
"Woman, do you really like that Suman?"
"Yes," he said.
What about me, big white?
You're different.
Ye smiled and clapped his cheek, "Don't whisper,
What do you care about Suman?
"I don't want you to like him.
"I like my brother,""I like 11,""I like my three sisters,""I like my friends more."
Sheaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Wife, you didn't mention me.
Their eyes looked as if they were being wronged, and their sleeves were like theirs.
Come on, I'll wash my face, and I'll talk to you for a while.
With a few clicks on the keyboard, the game was changed into another 3D graphic.
Drink?
Why did the brother let him drink?
She played on the keyboard, after drink, your wife will love more.
It's awful, isn't it?
Grandfather: Well, trust brother.
His eyes looked at the red wine, which the maid had just brought, and the wife had never let him drink, he curiously brought it.
Eva came out of the bathroom, and suddenly felt a change in the air, the interior is made of ice, separated from the outside cool, but she felt her heart half cold, she sat down along the bed, slowly swallowing down a glass of wine...
When was the wine here? She was astonished, but she saw her eyes lifted, and her purple eyes, cold and fierce, were filled with a kind of deceit.
Eve stood still for three seconds, raising her smile of all kinds, Hi, beauty, are you awake?

Levy's smiles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's beautiful but dangerous.
The two confronted, and no one spoke, as if they were stronger or weaker than they were in the air, and the two equally beautiful and dangerous eyes collided fiercely in the midst of the air, and a burning fire sprang up.
It feels too familiar.
It's like when they were in thermal waters, they were all evil, and they didn't care, and they wanted to put each other to death.
You want to kill me, don't you?
They were a kind of people, and since she had moved her heart to kill her, she knew that her real life would not be left to each other.
"Where is it?" asked hesitantly, his memories remaining on the island, and the scene in which Levy struck him with a rum bottle, for seven days, all his memories were blank.
He can't remember what happened when he was very white.
But he knew, according to his sharp observations and astonishing inferences, that Eve had escaped the danger, and that it was his help, or that on the island, even if the eleven were intact, neither of them could escape.
He knew that if he had a drink, he would have listened to those who saw him at first sight, so he would never let him touch the drink, and he had been born to become a fool by chance once, and three times, when he felt that he was white, he let him drink, and once, when he was very young, they broke in, and he let him drink, and then he went to the teacher to say goodbye.
Besides these five, this is the sixth.
She was sure she would not use him, and his brother was sure to temporarily leave Eve and 11 in order to protect him.
Saudi Arabia, Riyadh.
Levy smiled sweetly, with a ring,,You don't remember anything?

Eva is angry.
Though she felt more overwhelmed by hers, in these seven days, her little girl had no favour on him, and she had barely fallen into her bed, and she had barely been so kind, and she had barely been so tender,
Why doesn't he remember?
Levy was very uncertain, and said coldly, No!
"No need?"
She didn't hear?The girl's smile, becoming cold, has been tightened by a fire.
"I don't need this memory. "
Her eyes were cold, and a burst of fire was rising, and she was laughing, "No, you were only dreaming, and you woke up without any trace,
For a slave, it is not even a dream, it is not necessary to remember.
Their eyes were dim, their curtains were flickering, and the whole room was filled with terror.
The atmosphere is tight like a tight string.
Suddenly, as soon as he moved his foot, his shadow was like a ghost, and as soon as he blinked, he fled before her, and opened his five fingers, and straight took her throat, and the speed was great, and a wind swept through her, and she went back and forth, and her right foot was pushed up against the wall, and her body flipped,
After lying on the back, one leg sweeping to the spinal cord, the wind distinguished the direction, and did not turn,
He held back her wrists, stretching and pulling, as if the eagle had lost a chicken, and had thrown the whole man into the wall.
Oh, shit!
She had no time to breathe behind her. She lifted her hand, she held her hand on the wall, she kicked her feet up the wall, she avoided the hand wind that followed, she reached for the iron handle of the crystal lamp, she turned lightly, and she kicked her hand, forcing him to retreat.
Eve fell on the plane, a foot kicked the room wooden chair sweeping to Ming, and the people along, did not respond to him at all, who knows Ming's fist to the chair, huge impact force collided with each other, hard to break the chair.
Four.
There was a collision between the fist and the fist that came up, and at that moment the fist felt stiff, the tiger's mouth was sore, and the other hand opened, and grasped the hole in the fist of the fist of the fist, and twisted the fist of the fist of the fist of the fist of the fist, and twisted the fist of the fist, and twisted the fist, and twisted the fist the fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist fist
You can't beat me.
"I'm not," he said, "I'm not, I'm not."
A burning breath washed through her neck, her most familiar breath in seven days, and she smiled softly, Then let's try a harder heart.
She said, her elbow to the rear, she held her hand, she felt pain on the other side of her arm, and she twisted her hand, and kicked her back to his head.
At a moment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
There is only one leg.
Copper Bone.
"Yes, Sue, you have so much money to steal."
The chair was too uncomfortable, so it was scattered, it must have been stolen, and Eve threw the stick in her hand, and threw the punch on the face of the beautiful woman.
After two punches without being addicted, she was held by her hand, and she was beaten hard to the front, and the two figures instantly changed, and she was beaten hard on the wall by her hand, and she had no feeling, and on her chest, and on her belly, she had been beaten four or five times.
"Are you going to be like this?" "Are you going to be like this?" "Are you going to be like this?" "Are you going to be like this?" "Are you going to be like this?"
It's awful.
Compared to the first fight in the waterway, this time, the ink, the hand, the faster, the action proves, old man, I am harder than you, so you don't come and play harder with me.
A glance of the blood of the lip of the flower, like a lost rose, but stubbornly blossoms her beauty, stubbornly emits her charm, even if it is decayed in the decayed pride of the flower.
Why didn't he?
The Lady, laughing in a manner, lifted her hand, and swung at her, and her head flashed, and the Lady rose, and the other hand, from the side, swung at her face with a bloody hand.
With a gleam in her eyes,,This fist,This palm,This seven days, all of us have been deceived, and no one owes no one.
He wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There was a little blood in the corner of his lips, and he looked up, and he looked coldly, and, as the wind was blowing again, there was none of the strength left in his chest, even a few strokes, and he was dead.
It's too cold.
Although she smiled, it was a dangerous smile.
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
This is a very clumsy way of wrestling, It's like everyone forgets they're all good wrestlers, It's like fighting on the streets, It's just not defending, You're hitting me, I'm hitting you.
The two, like a beast, whispered, the furniture of the whole room scattered scattered scattered scattered scattered scattered scattered scattered scattered scattered scattered.
There was nothing good about either of them, there was a shade, there was a shade of blue and purple, and it was unbearable, especially that of Ye Wei, which was like a blood-stained broken doll, but she was like an infinite force, able to stand so stubbornly against the ink, and to show no weakness.
It was so quiet, that Sooman and the eleven had come early in the morning, with the leaves and the young, and with the little milk.
By the time they arrived, Eve was riding on her body, beating one-on-one, the fierce white night and the three young watches all shivering, suddenly she kicked one foot fiercely to her abdomen, Eve fell behind her body, looked to fall on a shattered glass, 11 next to her, She was faster than her, pulling her hand cleverly, the two stood up from the ground, just standing steady, at the same time beating, the fists hit together fiercely, the two retreated at the same time.
Eleven pushed her waist forward, and she stood straight, and both breathed, and were confused.
Their faces were beaten so hard they could not bear it.
When all looked at the look of the black, they knew that he had returned to his original form.
When there is a day, there is a great difference.
"You're really hot. "It's a very strange thing to see Eve hit like this for the first time.
Despite watching the play, but the hand has been tight, ready to fight the state.
Levy laughed, like a blooded rose, "I'm a beauty, I can't beat you, how about a group?
Heh,You can try?
"Brother White, no.
M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M
A cold smile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He can't go.
He's gonna want to get out of here.
Chen, you've beaten him, but he's dead.
Virus, good weapon.
Raise your thumb at night. Good idea.
The Three Little Looks at Ye.
Suddenly, a tear from breaking the window, shot into the room, the glass instantly broke, the room rose up a white smoke, all came out of the room, closed the door, entered again, it was empty.
"It's old," said the little milk, "and since it's gone, it's futile to follow it again.
As her eye dropped, she covered her abdomen, and breathed blood again, and fell into her 11th womb.
"Vyvy...
Before he hurried, he did not dare touch her, and was in a hurry.
Leth looks at the night, the night...
"Go to my room first," said 11; then he took her by the bed at night, and went to 11's room.
She was afraid to see the past, but the little milk bag entered the room of Shev, She was afraid of her son's danger, and she could only stay, and the little milk bag escaped the full debris of the wood, and jumped to the bed.
"Well, what are you doing?" asked Ying in a low voice, and sat down curiously.
Everyone looked at the computer screen.
M: Drink?
M: After drink, your wife will love more.
M: Is there something like that?
Grandfather: Well, trust brother.
Miss Chang said nothing to the heavens, this is the myth of kidnapping?
"Yeah," said theraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprap
A game between a gray wolf and a white rabbit.
The Little White Rabbit must have lost.
"It's a great great great great great.
The little milk bag touch, hands on the keyboard hit several keys, suddenly the screen seemed to collapse, scream scream scream scream scream scream scream scream s
Finally stop at a place.
"Dad, do you remember when we came and saw a car park outside?" asked the little milk.
Leaves three little.
"It's there," he said.
Ying wasting to speak, suddenly a great pain in his arm, followed by a great pain in his liver, like a sharp silver needle, and a great pain in his limbs,
A convulsion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Achen..."
"Dad..."
Let's call Suman.
Jiang, said Jiang, the little milk bag jumped down, and hurried out.
"Achen, hold on, it will be all right."
De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De
His hands trembled in fear.
Isn't Suman saying he'll get sick tomorrow?
Is it too early?
"Oh..."
There was a sudden screaming, and there was a burst of blue on the forehead, and the finest five organs were twisted together, as if they had endured the pain of non-humans, and had gone beyond the limits... into a coma.
Chapter 376
The virus had developed early on, and she was in a panic, sitting like a needle, and she wanted to be with the three, and Suman suggested that she shouldn't go to the laboratory, and the beauty always spoke with a kind of dignity that could not be resisted, and even if she had been in a panic, she did not go to the laboratory.
Mummy, don't worry. Dad's gonna be okay.
Anya, the small pink face of different age of stability and firmness, he smiled gracefully, as if nothing had happened before, the lightness of which is admirable.
Baby, Mommy's not so good, and you're here to comfort, okay.
Miss Cheung knew her son best. She laughed and told him not to worry.
But, no more worry, she will take care of the son, not panic that even the son's emotions are free to shine.
What a pity it would have been if she had been frightened and comforted by a small packet of the same.
She's always been the most brave mom?
Both mother and daughter went to see YV. She was severely injured and unconscious. She had been checked early in the morning, and had been ordered to prepare for the medicine, and to give her the pain medication.
Joan looked at Yves and felt a bit of pain. She was injured so severely, and the night was quiet.
Isn't It's not worth it?
There was a drop of blood in Eve's room, and her clothes were bleeded, and when she saw it she was beaten and bleeded.
It's awful if you can get Eve into a coma.
It's all right. It'll take a few days.
She smiled at night, and gave her medicine.
Didn't you say there was some deep hatred between them, that they were all going to die?
He touched his chin at night, and he thought seriously, and it was very wrong, he said.
Are You Angry?
They never beat you to death.
said the eleventh, chill, she is now more curious about how suddenly it is, too suddenly,
When will she wake up at night?
"I'll almost wake up tomorrow morning.
said White Night, poking the shoulder of the eleventh, said the eleventh, did the eleventh really fall in?
What do you say?
Was she in love with her big white brother or was she beautiful?
Think about it.It's supposed to be beautiful.
"Why?" asked the eleventh and the twilight, thinking in the twilight, "Be quiet, my dear, and you know what it is to love."
"How do you feel?
said the little milk, such a character as to invite to see her, big white?
After he became a fool, Eve would follow him at will, if she had replaced someone, she would have thrown away.
That's not the reason.
Poor Vivi.
Looking at her wounds at night, she sighed as if she were dressed, and laughing as if she were dressed, she said, "I'm a little expecting how she's taken such a strong ink and beauty.
Miss Cheung, who kept silent, couldn't help crying,I've always been confused, isn't there a difference between big white and ink? isn't it one person?
Mummy, it's pretty easy, too much too much too?The little milkshake objected, agreeing at night, agreeing at night, and they'd just taken them as one.
A demon. an angel.

"No," said the father, "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's not hard to get through," "sometimes it's not hard to get through," "sometimes it's not hard to get through," "sometimes it's not hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard to get through," "sometimes it's hard
"It's all one," said Jian, smiling at his point of view.
It's different.
The same.

It seemed to see what she was thinking, and the little bun laughed again, "Mommy, democratic choice, have you ever seen a real democracy?
You say society harmony, when has society harmony?
White Night, Eleven up thumb, strong, just one word.
"You're a big man. don't behave like a weak woman.
Small Package
Some laughed away from Room 11, and at night laughed, "It's really a great mother.
"Their house is exquisite.
No No No No No No No No No No No
"Mr Su," said the master, "I ask you to go to the laboratory."
When the maid came hurriedly to ask for the night, all of them were astonished.
What's wrong?
"Suman let the night go to the lab."
Little Chew explains, Chew's mind is sinking, is not Achen's situation worse? heart pounding, Chew's face suddenly become extremely difficult to see.
She was sitting alone in the court, and the little lamb would have liked to accompany her, but it was too late for him, and the little lamb could only go back to rest.
It was also hot in the evenings, there was almost no wind, and the temperature outside was unbearable, and even in shorts it was unbearable.
Joan, however, unexpectedly had her limbs frozen, a thin layer of cold sweat on her forehead, and did not feel any warmth.
Cold.
It was cold coming from inside out, and it felt like Louis had told her she had a virus, and they were waiting for the leaves to come.
It's very scary.
It was late in the evening, she wanted to look at the laboratory several times, but did not dare to approach, what the virus looked like at the time of the attack, she knew.
When she got sick, she had a hard time, but she didn't get much, and Louis gave her anesthesia to relieve the pain,
But when she saw Zhangpo in that little house, she bled her head, because it was too painful to choose to die.
The more I remembered the tragedy before Zhang Po's death, the cooler the body felt, the faster the heart jumped, the unhappy premonition hit again on the head.
It was a quiet night, with only the fountain of the courtyard, the sound of the fountain of the courtyard, which used to sound like a calm, but this night it seems to be a disturbing.
She went for a while in the court, and sat down, and pondered, and all seemed to be very quiet, as if in the darkness, so quiet that there was no ordinary.
Halfway, she stood up, as if to make a decision, to the direction of the study.
The closer, the more terrifying, She was afraid to hear the rustle of leaves, Surprisingly, but quietly, Cheng Anya comforted herself, perhaps nothing, The white-night medicine was so high, and Suman was a virus expert, which was not the same as Zhang Po,
Maybe there's a turn. She doesn't scare herself.
She steered away from the door of the study and walked straight into it.
White Night recorded and studied the data on the screen, the first to find Cheng Anya, he picked up the eyebrow, "Anya, how come?
Suman was testing two doses without raising his head, and analyzing the compounds with microscopes, very seriously and without hesitation, said Jiang.
I'm not going to quarrel with you, I'll just go with him.
He looked at the leaves at night, and nodded.
The whole laboratory is not very large, but the equipment is very complete, it feels here is a very modern research center, like the scenes in the movie.
On the operating room,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He held his hand with his eyes, but he found a trace of blood on the floor, and he looked under his eyes, and there was a large piece of blood under his feet, and he looked at his arms, where they were held tightly.
For reasons of struggle, there are two circles very obvious wounds, blood flowing.
Suddenly, she bit her lower lip, holding the acid in her eyes, she could imagine how he struggled, and how he hurt himself.
He must have tried to get out.
Achen
Separated from her coat, she held his hand, and she looked at the fallen leaves, and in her heart was a sudden pain, and she wanted to cry, but could not; she could not cry, and he would surely be well.
There is a good there is a person to be recompensed is Louis, not to be tormented, to be tormented in life.
Achen, don't worry,I'll be with you always.
Even if you go to hell, I'll be with you, and I'll never leave you alone.
She remembered her earlier pledge that from now on she would be Shen's guardian, but she did not fulfil her pledge, but she nearly killed him.
What kind of guardian is she?
It's pretty.
Jiang wasted a little, holding tightly the three leaves, biting his lips to withstand the tears that were coming, but accompanied him quietly.
Leth fell asleep,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's good to be alive.
He's alive for a second She's with him He's alive for a day She's with him a day.
Chapter 377
Joan had been accompanying her to the laboratory until late in the night, when she gave her tranquilizer and fell asleep, in the laboratory only the sound of electrical instruments flashing, and the sound of the test tubes touching, and the reaction of the test tubes, was very quiet.
She did what she had promised, and though she had no more fear in her heart, she did not go to fight with Suman at night, and she was afraid of affecting their work.
Two men,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She sat quietly with the three, very tired, but without trouble, looking openly at his face, occasionally looking up at White Night and Suman, judging from their colours the progress of things.
Later, the night seemed to have passed, "Anya, you go back to rest, and the leaf tries to give you a tranquilizer, and you won't wake up until we give you a solution, and you'll be fine here too."
It's okay, I'm not tired.
She insisted on heritage.
"I'm not afraid of you're tired, but I'm afraid that your viral instability is increasing and that you're going to get sick early."
Zhang opened her mouth without saying anything, and still held her hands, and refused to let go; she knew that she was right, but she did not want to leave.
"You can't stay with him for days or nights without eating or sleeping.
' said White Night, 'I'd rather this mother be more stubborn than Vivi.' 'It's hard to say,' he said. 'I'm sure she's more stubborn than Vivi.'
"Wait a second.
She had nothing to do with her return, she said.
She shook her head at night, and when she was tired, she would go.
He really doesn't understand what love is, why a wise man can become dumb, and choose such dumb acts, it doesn't help at all.
White Night gave Suman the good data to exchange Suman's test data.
Suman put the information on one side of the table, cold eyes, the whole laboratory like to bring a cold wind, he said coldly, There are women in my mind, do half the work.
In the night,
Sweetie,you're pretty!
That's what's been said, that's what's been said, that's what's been said, that's what's been said, that's what's been said, that's what's been said.
Maybe that's the way it is.
Otherwise I wouldn't have avoided a beauty like Vivi.
Joan stood up slowly, her lips twitched, angrily wanting to beat the table, "So beautiful, don't do this kind of gender discrimination.
Su's face,,I'm a sex discrimination You can take what I'm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss
Go, Suman said not to see a woman, I'm tired, she can't stay, people work twice as hard as little, research does not solve is big, whether it's fake, she really can't stay in the lab anymore.
Raise your thumb at night.
Susan looked back, hum, continued to work, because time is more urgent, and at night there is no time to bite, continued to analyze the data before the screen.
This was one of the most difficult problems he had ever encountered as a doctor, and he had to concentrate very much on his head or he would not be able to follow Suman's pace.
There is also competition, it is inevitable, the beauty from the beginning is an exaggerated kiss, and the alleged disdain of all the attitudes is very uncomfortable, the white-night pride, who is called the genius doctor, who will be such disdain, now is the strength to give him the heart.
His reputation as a genius is not a game.
So beautiful, I curse you to be planted in the hands of a woman.
Cheng Yan Yan.
Wouldn't a person be waiting for a woman?
When I first heard of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This Earth is a little bit occupied by a corrupt woman, who thinks she has been on the Internet for many years, knows a corrupt wolf, a corrupt woman, a corrupt woman, a corrupt woman, a corrupt woman, a corrupt woman, a corrupt woman, a corrupt woman, a corrupt woman.
It's really uncomfortable to feel like you're being disrespected.
Suddenly, a picture floated in my mind. It was often said, An orphan or a widow, living in a room must not be cleaned by fire, but what if an orphan or a widow?
In particular, one of the orphans is still bent,,,,,,,,,,,,,...
Miss Cheung washed away in the wind.
Oh Oh Oh
She must have been ill to have such an association, Su is the cold look of the murderer of me, and the eyes of the others are the heavens and the earth, but I am the only arrogant, holy and dusty, and at a glance I feel defiled the spirit of the gods, how can I have sex with the white night?
All he's doing is sex discrimination is stimulating her thinking is spreading, thinking.
O O O O.
The days passed quickly, and within seven days, Ye Wei's wounds were healed, her face could not be seen any more, and she was completely restored to her original condition, and it was too soon for the little doll to claim that her aunt was a dead cockroach.
The last time I wasted my hands very quickly, this time too.
Thought she might have a feeling of loss, she had been smiling like a flower since she was awake, and her manners and actions were no different from the past, and she could not see any difference, as if she had never met a flower like a flower.
She didn't mention one of her beauties or one of her big white brothers, it felt like that person had disappeared from her world, there was nothing to mention, the first terrorist organization had some work to do, they hadn't been managers, and Evey and 11 were staying in Riyadh.
During this time, the outside was also calm, the only smoke was Melanie, who was angry and red-eyed, leading the first terrorist organization's most sophisticated air force in the desert to surround Prince William of r.
After all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Every day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The old man has time to spend with you, to see who spends more.
Such a barbaric and aggressive act, indeed only the terrorists have done, to the extent of the blackness of Chu's belly, to cut off the water source has been the lightest, rather than to estimate the face, the war will be more distorted and terrible.
In this regard, Lin's officials won, and people were also released, the city's top officials personally confirmed, misunderstood one, and the situation of Tang four also gradually recovered in good,
There are also people in the town.
On the one hand, he was involved in the affairs of Longmen in North America, and on the other hand, he was in contact with the terrorists and was ready to increase his support for Chu's departure, in addition to responding to the siege and suppression by several major government forces, such as the Spanish and Italian governments.
The Small Pack is a suggestion to move the power of the Middle East, to avoid the front, because it is clear that the move is a provocation to the r countries, and that the neighboring countries, whether willing or unwilling, are coming out to help, and no one is coming out to protest.
In addition to the recent clashes with the Black Party have shocked many people. In short, all the countries are coming and trying to use this opportunity to weaken the power of the first terrorist organization.
I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing, I'm still doing my thing
Unlike this man always style, most small countries are really only dare to speak, dare to act.
When the First Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror Terror
Who knows, theft seems to have disappeared, except for a few small-scale military operations in the Middle East involving government troops.
It was awkward to find out that Louis was only trying to lobby the authorities for a murderer with a knife, and that was why there was such a mess.
The eleven pointed out that was not the way Louis had always been.
Eve agrees, that they had little to do with the Black Party, but that would not be the way Louis had always been, nor would he be so low as to kill with a knife.
Will it be the brother?
Suddenly, she asked, these days she has often seen and discussed these things with them, and she herself has a general understanding.
"What are they going to do?" said Ye, pointing out the problem, and not even the little packet could understand it.
"The united government will not be long."
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
War is a dead enemy of terror.

This was the first terrorist organization in history, and one of the most extensive military operations in history. The anti-terrorist organizations had been fighting for a long time, and they were beginning to put an arrest on the island, and this time they were threatening to be very good relations between the countries and the countries of South America and South America.
The biggest was the dissolution of the coalition government this time.
If they were tos their feet, the most likely outcome would be a burning of stone in order to rescue the country and keep the peace, the best way to deal with it would be to disband the government army and to plan this resentment for the private resentment of Chu and Prince William, who are fighting and cheating on women.
Only then can peace be maintained.
"It takes half a month to see the situation," he said. "It's better to use your own relationship to shake up the black party."
The little bottle touched his lower lip and laughed, and he wanted to come to see a crab fight.
But a man is a wise man. You have to count him, but it's not easy.
11 agree, "You want to get the chief to do business, you have to pay the same for it, and you have to see if he wants to catch someone, or if he wants to break the case, or you can not ask him.
"It's a lot of business," he said, "but it's not going to look like this, it's going to look like what we want and we'd rather say it."
Levy laughed,But if Chu had to get back to the beauty,then he wouldn't have been able to cope with an attack by the gang.
"I think it will be a few days," said the little bottle, touching his nose.
Aunt, do you want to know about the great white aunt?
"The slaves are looking forward to hearing from him," said Eve, smiling in all manner of ways, playing with the glass of light in her hand.
It's like a big white thing, and it doesn't have any effect on her.
Joan laughed, "Vi, don't behave, you can beat him."
It's absolutely true. She's been beaten right now, she's afraid, she's really thinking about giving her eight, but the power is there, she has to admit, she's really too strong.
Ying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yes, Eleven.

With a smile, like a spring wind, like a blossoming flower, pure, bright eyes hiding a smile, he asked innocently, Wei, do you not have a gun?
Why do it?
Little Cheese Laugh, Mom, correct,
You're too strong. He's always a bloodsucker, but he laughs innocuous.
The 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 12 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 18 19 19 20 21 22 22 23 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 29 30 31 32 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 56 57 58 58 59 59 62 62 63 63 63 63 63 64 64 65 69 70 70 80 81 82 82 82 83 83 84 84 84 85 85 86 87 83 84 84 84 85 86 86 87 87 87 88 88 89 89 89 89 90 90 90 90 91 92 93 94 94 94 94 94 95 95 95 95 96 97 97 98 98 98 98 97 98 98 98 98 98 98 98 98 98 98 99 99 99 98 98 98 98 98 98 98 99 99 99 99 98 98 98 98 98 98 98 99 99 99 99 98 98 98 98 98 98 98 99 99 99 99 98 98 98
Eve wants to kill him.
That day she saw with her eyes her hand pressed to the handle, but it never came out. Although the action was like lightning, it was not a fake of many years, and she was the next step in every action of the fight.
They've been shot so they haven't been shot. What's that gonna mean?
Their acquaintance, Ye, would have preferred to put a man to death and it would not have been possible for him to get a punch, but the result was that he was beaten half to death.
Levy's face doesn't change, smiles go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go
Little Couple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,you know what people do with their tactics?
"Well, you shouldn't have shot at Achen at first, and you should have looked closely at his weaknesses," he said.
Isn't it
"My sister, how are you? Oh, my brother, if you beat me, make sure you don't recognize his face."
Joan laughed, and did not continue to ask.
The Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine Wine
So, what's ink, what's big white, roll aside.
A pair of calm eyes.
"Are there any signs of being awake?" she asked suddenly. "She hasn't been to the laboratory, and she's been injured for several days.
De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De
But she knew that's not when she woke up.
This virus is too strong.
"No," said Suman, "as long as he's been developing solvents, he's been doing it, with nutrients and tranquilizers, and with all sorts of things that I don't know how to do."
It's awful.
Eve had some heartache, and if it were to say who is the one she loves most in the world, it is definitely not the big white, nor the black black, but the three.
So did Jian, who knew that was the life force of Ying three day by day, that the seven days had passed for days, and that he could only keep his pulse on these drugs.
Though she had a heart, she had nothing to do, but she was in danger.
"Mommymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymy
"There's me in this world," said the little milk, smiling gracefully. "My father won't let go of me, or my mother will marry me, and he will jump out of the coffin as a ghost."
Ye and Cheng An Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
There must have been a lot to do with 11 and with Levy before they left Levy, but Levy insisted on staying, and no matter what went on outside, Levy was always quiet, and there were not many people to guard, and they were both responsible for the safety of Levy's three.
The last time they lost their jobs and this time they were not going to leave, and history was not going to repeat itself on them.
Eleven suddenly asked,,Anya,you say that Louis can touch you,that his blood can cure the poison?
White Night also spoke of this, and if we had his blood, it would have been quicker, but Louis must have thought, that he had no trace, that he could not be found at all, said Joan.
When it came to Louis, she was still terrified.
"Where did he go? I always thought it was the calm before the storm, and there must be something going on.
Mommy, don't think too much about the last thing, and don't do it again.
Though there were not many people, the Suman's house was not to be destroyed, nor was it to be seen from outside, nor to be approached, nor was it to be seen from outside.
It's a stronghold, it's safe to go out and in.
"I'm not worried about this," he said.
"My sister, I'm curious, why don't you have a virus?"
"Well, if you count the days, then there are days left for the month, and even if there are no days left for the death, then the virus should start sooner.
"I don't know.
She's all right these days, She's all right, She's all right, She's all right, She's all right, She's all right, She's all right, She's all right.
She was lying on the operating room, not waiting to die, but to wake up.
"Well, I'm too bored.
"Of course, Mom," said the little milk, smiling, and then, with a lovely finger, "I don't think you're crazy.
"You must be a stranger.
Everybody laughed..................................................................................................
As soon as they came back, they surrounded them at once.
Susan's face looked very bad, though she looked very tired, her cheeks were a little red, and in her cold eyes, the flame jumped, and she couldn't help but hold her arm.
What's wrong?
So, So, So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So
Hiddenly, she missed a good play.
"So beautiful," "Is the medicine out?"
What about Achen?
Tomorrow.

Waving his hands at night, he sat down and drank a cup of tea before he said, It's still not good enough, let's see tomorrow.
Jiang's heart suddenly dropped, looking at their faces, she thought hopeless, didn't know when to wait, didn't think it was good news.
Her pale face turned red, her eyes turned red, and though she hadn't seen anything in the past these days in front of the little milk, only she knew that at night she was worried she wouldn't be able to sleep, and she stared at the direction of the laboratory.
I prayed to the Lord more than a hundred times, only to ask him to be in peace.
That's good.
The baby's face is happy, the child's nervous mood is also relieved.
Suman rubbed his head slightly, and his mouth a little softer, Don't you worry about it?
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
"Don't worry.
Little Milk laughed, and looked at Suman, and looked at the very dim white night, and he felt a little strange, acutely, "Suman, white night, since it is good news, what have you done with the scary face when you have just come.
That's not right.
What to say, Suman glanced past, raised his hand, smiled, put a mouth on, and continued to drink tea.
It was a strange thing, that Eve's eyes were turning in the darkness and in the darkness of Suman's face, and that, in fact, they were unanimous in ignoring the fingerprints of the darkness's face, and even the little milk bag.
There was a silence in the hall.
The beauty hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum
When he smiled, all thought that Suman's next move would be to kill him, who knew that his cold eyes were sweeping through the night, and brushing his sleeves.
Everyone looked at his back.
What's happened?
The little milk bag jumped into the white night, the little palm on the handprint, the dark eyes blink blink, "White night, what about your face?
"To mosquitoes," said the man, "the mosquitoes are more in summer than in summer."
White Night laughed, put down the cup, and rubbed the head of the small milk bag is extremely sad, Why do people like to touch his head?
Ye shuttered her eyes, and the little milk bag compared his fingers and fingerprints, in truth, to testify, "White night, your fingers don't seem so thin.
Their eyes were fixed on the white face.
Put on a white face, seeking the truth.
Knowing that the virus was about to be solved, Jian's heart was relaxed a lot, and couldn't help paying attention to such a beautiful handprint on the face of the white night, and hit it really well, it's very useful.
Look at the master's hand is very beautiful.
"Don't behave," said Suman.
Eve laughed with a little danger, the expression, supposing to bite the teeth, very correct.
Why did he beat you?
What have you done?
Wouldn't you be rude?
Everyone almost unanimously expressed their doubts.
Put down the cup at night very gently, "I'm tired, go back to sleep.
Everybody looked at the back of the white night tree, and thought of Suman so cold as to make people look, and smelled of rape.
Eve grieved and clapped, "No, you don't have to bend like this..."
CHAPTER 379
The beauty with her claws, wanted to hurry up to tear the beef with the hands of the white night, the gorgeous five organs twisted together, look like a special terror, like a supernatural ghost.
The little milk bag seems to have seen the beauty of the long hair flying like a terror.
Miss Cheung smiled softly, but her eyes could not conceal the laughter, and as soon as anyone saw it, the beautiful woman went away.
As for her genius, she was the strongest. Fortunately, she didn't turn her head when she heard it at night.
Aunt, I have a question, what is the bend?
Miss Cheung's smile twisted and stiff, 11 eyes eyes nose, still as a mountain, Levy turned her head, gently clapped the head of Nanning, language of long learning, "Dear child, after all, you must not be bent, do not need to know.

Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak
Is it possible to have a better mind than Suman?
This woman is hiding more and more.
"What kind of onion is he more than the beauty of Sue
I'm really hit.I'm sorry.You're all different from me.
It's too much.
Do You Need Compassion
Joan was very interested in the play. It is normal for you to run.
Yes indeed!
For a moment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even though Sue's reaction isn't very nice, at least there's a reaction, isn't there, or is it so fierce that if you're a street man, you're going to be like a light-headed king?
It's impossible.
"My three sisters, 11, is the beauty just turned red?" she asked, with more twisted laugh.
"Suspect, yes."
Miss Cheokokokokokokokokokokokokok
Levy's eyes blinked, not as the two women had gone, but as she touched her chin, "Why?
"Why?
Eve turned her white eyes and said, Do you like women? Do you like men? Then the solitary man and the widow should be together, and it would be dangerous if they were alone.
Why is it so late in the night, so beautiful?
"Oh, yes.
Miss Cheung thought as well, hadn't thought very much, and when Ye came forward she felt a little strange,
How else do you get a hand?
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
But are they that is so shallow, that they have known it for ten years, and that they have not seen it in any way, and that they know the nature of it
This can't be done.
He's not a woman, and more than that, a man.
"Why?
Jian thinks so too, that man, though he looks gentle and elegant, is in fact very vague, giving a feeling of being very far away, like a floating cloud.
You shouldn't do this. If you change Yechen, you can do this thing, and at night you shouldn't.
Then why should we shake hands at night?
She asked again, and the three women looked at each other, and had doubts in their eyes.
"You should eat tofu," said 11, "but it's not like that," he said.
That's not possible.
Miss Chen also turned her head, very suspicious.
Isn't the White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White
"If Suman had been, he would have been on the other side of the night, and then sent him to Yan, would he have simply given him one hand?"
He said coldly, "I'll take a deep look at Su's distorted personality."
Besides, there is Achen in the laboratory.
The three remained silent again, and the little bottle lifted her hand weakly, "Are you going to think I am here too?
Why are you still here, when we are talking about something that is not good for children?
Miss Cheung stared at him, as if you were not going.You heard that it was your fault, and it was not about us.
"The correct answer. "
"I agree."
Little Milk Pack
Oh, woman, it's a terrible creature, but it's his best Nono.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Eve went away completely and turned to the court.
The shadow feels like it's just floating away, looking at something special and scary.
It's dinner.
Everybody was together, Miss Cheung, Ye Wei, 11, and the little milk bag, four eyes floating constantly on the white night and Suman, and the expressions were all a little corrected.
Miss Cheung is a well-known delay wolf. Knowing that the cure has hope, the heart is extremely relaxed, naturally has leisure to consume others.
In fact, from the eyes of her long time in the beauty world, White and Suman are absolutely matching pair, Suman white dress over the snow, cold arrogance, White White Trees in the wind, handsome and handsome.
The two are hard to see good look, stand together very eye, very goddess couple.
She's the hottest.
The applause on the face of the white night after an afternoon has gone away, now the breeze lightly eat, to all the unanimous attention, very humble acceptance.
That's not a common man's strength.
Eve leaned closer to Suman, laughing and asking, Su, beauty, to the hair of our brother at night?
White Night Brother?
As soon as everyone shook their eyes.
There's nothing to say, don't behave like that,' said Eve, cutting on Sue's sleeves.'Isn't our brother at night beating you?I'll beat him for you, and I know you can beat him.
It's okay. I've done it.
Don't worry.
Suman hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum
"Don't worry," I said. "I don't see him. I've been trying to beat him.
There's nothing to worry about.
Ye continued to laugh.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
"Well then," he said.
No matter what she said, she was told the truth by the beauty, and she felt that her mouth was too tight, and that it was impossible to find out the secrets of the night.
"You are too busy to entertain the public.
No No No No No No No No.
Yves protested.
I agree.
Miss Chang continued to eat, to keep the small milk bag out of the fire, to avoid harm to the pond.
"Brother of the Night, are you right?"
Ye, with a wink, asked innocently, "I remember last year the Miss of the World was around you, Russian, and I have seen you kiss,
Should it be straight?
For a moment in the darkness, a glance at the brows, "You are really devils,
Can you see it?
"I'll say that image is you, indeed.
Levy smiled, Since it is straight I can rest assured, Don't cheat Sue.
She smiled at night, and as if she were all right, she said to Miss, "You must rest early, take blood tomorrow, and do not eat before you go into the laboratory.
He said, Get up and go.
All looked at his dish, and barely moved.
"The last medicine is my blood," answered Jian.
No No No No No No No No
She had no doubt that was said at dawn, and that his speech was easy and sure, and she should have left half of her heart.
"The blood of my three sisters," I thought, "the blood of Louis."
Ying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I'm thinking of him.
"There should be an eight percent."
"Yes, white night, why hasn't the three sisters got the virus?
She looks like a normal. Why is she so serious?
asked Eve curiously.
"It's not surprising that virus is much more stable than the second one, and even with a month and a few more days, I've given her anesthesia, and I've given her more than ten days, so the virus is under control," he said.
He smiled softly at night.
That's what it is.
Zhang no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11 She looked at the white dish, and it was empty, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, and she looked at it, she looked at it looked at it, she looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at it looked at the look at the look at looking at the look at looking at the look at looking at looking at the look at looking at looking at the look at looking at looking at the look at looking at looking at looking at the look at looking at looking at looking at looking at the look at
You're not feeling well, you're not feeling well, you're not feeling well well, you're not feeling well well, you're not feeling well, you're not feeling well, you're not feeling well, you're not feeling well, you're not feeling well.
"What did you do to people? " "It's a strange thing to do to a man."
Several eyes were fixed on the face of the night, the light smile of the night, "no telling.
We haven't been moving for a long time.
Eve twisted her arm and laughed threateningly, 11 said he had received the message, that he could be active at night, suppressed by force, to see if he did not say.
Raise your hand at night. He has a gold medal.
All of them.
Well, cut off your legs, sit in a wheelchair as if to cure the poison, it's just your brain and not your feet.
"Aunt, you are cruel!"
Raise Your Thumb.
Their servants gave them Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo Bo
Levy laughed with his head up, sister Dena, your little mouth is getting sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter.
Miss Vivi, she smiled, with only a pair of shiny, dark eyes, shy and frightened, very beautiful, though it is not clear what she looks like, but it is clear from these eyes that she is absolutely beautiful.
Levy laugh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides, it is a good thing sent by the princess.
"It tastes a little strange.
Miss Cheokokokokokokokokokokok.
Come on, it smells good, said the little milk.
When Diana had a bowl, and put it in front of her, she felt a diarrhea, but because they were all, and not too rude, she had to endure, and the smell kept going, she really couldn't resist, and she covered her mouth and ran out of the dining room, and it was not enough to vomit...
As Diana and others were in astonishment, the little milk bag and Levy hurriedly dropped the bowl chopsticks and pursued out, Cheng Anja was holding the column and vomiting, and all faces looked at each other.
"Mom, are you feeling sick?"
"How are you, sister?"
Jiang Yang wasting, stopped for a long time, the whole thing was a little flouting.
With his eyes twisted at night, after he had finished, he had to give her blood, and he laughed, "It's all right, it's all right, I'm probably not used to the taste.
Take your hands out.The white night, with a gentle smile, She reached out with her hands, and the white night covered her with a thin sheet of paper, and looked at her in a strange way.
The little bottle wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not a virus.
murmured at night,She's pregnant.
CHAPTER 380 Do you want children?
Pregnant?
With her eyes wide open, and her mind blank, as if she had been shattered by lightning, she was shocked.
It's like hearing about aliens taking over Earth.
White Night was a little strange, a little unbelievable, a few strokes of the vein, finally confirmed, eyes looked strangely, as if pondering what.
"Good night,""You're not wrong,""The three sisters are pregnant,""They jumped two planes on the way to their escape,""If the pregnant child had already disappeared,"
How is it possible to be alive?
Ye also felt in the way there is no less excitement,
Is this kid too old, or...
11))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
She's pregnant, she said, with a bit of astonishment, looking at her, still in astonishment, and not slowing for half an hour,
He sat in silence, as if a pregnancy had nothing to do with her.
Everyone looked at each other, and at one time did not know what to say.
The little bottle of milk wavered in front of her, and she came back, a little pale,
"The boy..."
Eve and others saw her in this way and thought, This child should not be Louis, if it were indeed Louis, it would be enough.
It's complicated.
Lewis had her for so many days, and he would have touched her freely, and no one would have wondered what would have done with her.
It looks like pregnancy isn't long. It's a reasonable inference.
There was some strangeness in the look of Anya, and she and the eleven could not help but look away, and the little milk bag looked quietly at his mother.
It's less than two weeks, and it's about ten days," said the white night, more strange than that.
"What?" cried Eve, her eyes suddenly turning strange, her lips squeaking, "Doesn't he have a color?"
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
In addition to wearing gloves and avoiding physical contact with her, everyone agreed that they collided with each other when jumping in the desert, and then infected with the virus.
But the truth looks like a thunderbolt.
It's easy to relate to what, Chen's face couldn't resist a red, I'm a bit sorry, Wei, you too direct?
11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 18 19 19 20 21 22 23 23 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 34 35 36 37 37 38 38 39 39 44 44 44 44 46 46 47 47 47 48 48 48 49 49 49 50 51 52 53 53 54 54 54 53 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54 54
Ye was very gentle, said the old man, The peonies die, and the devils are the wind.
It's really brave. It's full of sperm.
What a fool!
She always knows what happens when a beauty doesn't die.
It's not what you think.
Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang
Then Miss Cheng wasted her time.
Well, since it's all that's what it's all about, anyway, it's all about being so brave, she didn't say, the more black she had, she said.
How do you get pregnant?
There was a little joy, a little wandering, a little more fear, and it was not a good time to be pregnant.
She had a virus in the castle, and she was so indifferent, that she could not take any contraceptives under those conditions, because to escape, they had not thought so much at once, and there was an outcry.
It's awful.
How could her life expectancy be so high?
Twice. often?
Wouldn't it be a Guinness Book of Records if we had one in the future?
It wasted by the wind.
Her mind was so dispersed, that she was walking like a horse, and she was so strong, that she imagined a situation in which ten children were around her crying for Mommy.
Cheng Ya finally understood what is called a tiger body, a moment wake up.
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
Eva, 11 and White Night were already shocked by the splendid expression on her face, slowly enjoyed a silent play, the more wonderful the more wonderful, little milk asked weakly, "Mommy, what are you thinking?
Joan shakes her head and quickly returns to her usual smile, not even to the blink of her eyes, "I don't mean anything.
They didn't know what she was thinking, and she herself wasted by Redne, and if she told anyone, she would have laughed for three days and three nights, and I'm afraid there's only such a good woman in the world who thinks all this shit when she knows she's pregnant, but again, they're not a hundred percent of the mortals,
Ye three little but struggled one day and one night, both of them did not know how many times...
Cheng Anya is psychological balance.
"Goodnight," said the child.
She's worried about her child's health. She's pregnant with an unhealthy child, and she's got a lot of herbicides in her body, and she's probably going to hurt the child. If she's got a little kid with no arms and no legs, or a little kid with intellectual disabilities, she's better off not having him at the beginning.
How can a child be born when he is not healthy?
"Yes, will the child be infected with the virus?"
"It's not clear yet, after all, it's too small, and it's going to have to wait a little longer before it can be checked out," he said.
It's more or less a matter of course. She's pregnant, and it seems that the process of detoxification is going to get more complicated.
He's gonna have to find out about suman.
Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang
Levy, seeing her mind, said softly, Sister-don't worry too much, the virus will be cleared tomorrow, the child is still young, I'm not sure your virus will be cleared, the child's virus will be cleared too.
You and your brother are young and have a chance to have children.
"I think Mum gave birth to a little brother.
"We also think," said Y, "that's too healthy to live," said Y Y, "and my heart is too heavy," said Y Y, "and it doesn't seem like I'm really saying that," she said.
By convention, in fact without checking and knowing, this child can't keep.
Joan thought about it too, her face lost its colour, her eyes were dark, and she had no light, and she had gone through a pain.
Really?
She didn't want to be too pessimistic. She wanted to stay.
The crystal of love, she will not beat.
"Anya, don't bother until the virus is cleared of your body," said he, "and the child, and the engine." His smile was always distant, but it was warm and comfortable, especially a white coat and a doctor, which made him feel more comfortable.
Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang Jiang
Levy turned to think about it and asked: "Where are the three sisters, who have been in good condition and have not shown any other symptoms?
Joan is also thinking about this, her body has been healthy, is it really possible to transfer to the child?
If it were, the child would surely be in trouble.
There is a possibility.
With a twisted eye, there was indeed a virus in Cochrane's blood analysis, and it was not possible to say that it had all been transferred to the child, and that if it had been transferred to the child, the child would certainly not have needed it.
"I'll go and talk to Suman.
said he, out of the hall, to Suman's room.
In between the eyelids.
There was anxious premonition in Zhang's heart, like this little life with which he had not yet come into contact, perhaps for no reason, but at the beginning of it was just an empty joy, a heart, a needle of pain.
Mummy, don't worry, until you have a deal with Suman at night.
I'll give you a check.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
"Yes, sister, don't worry too much, perhaps we can't say too well," said Eve with a smile.
Joan laughed, You're all right, I'm just thinking, I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.
"I like my sister. "
My Sister is the most cute. He can be my Sister's flower messenger. He must be a good brother.
Why not the brother?
My brother too, but I still like my sister more. The little milk bag smiled, with a bit of excitement, "If only my sister had been okay,
Soon she will be out.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
I bet on my sister.
"Then you've lost, according to the tradition of the Leaf family," said Leaf, touching her chin, with a verse.
It seems to be.
"I'll have a sister.
CHAPTER 381
Anya returned to the room, sitting, I don't know if the heart act, always feeling the child growing in her belly, there is a feeling of a line of heart, just so many people have nothing very special feeling, just feel shocked.
Now a man stands on a balcony, looking at the moon in the sky, feels a full heart.
She had a very strong mother feeling more moved than when she learned that she was in peace.
Maybe it's the child she had after she fell in love with Yechen, meaning more than that time.
Ning is the pillar of her foreign country, so the child is the crystal of her love with A Chen, and he does not know whether there is a chance to be born, or whether he will be healthy, which A Chen will give any mother more attention and care to the child.
There is no doubt about that.
Unhealth is the biggest problem at present.
Under Heaven all mothers have a mentality, love their children, cherish their children, can hope to live, peacefully grow up, Cheng Anya is no exception.
Tonight at Lyd, the moon is round, the light of the moon is clear and gentle, it shines among the people, the whole city is lit as if it were covered in the mother's gentle arms, she can't help praying, God can give the child a chance to survive.
Joan was not a believer, but she couldn't help thinking that if prayer was really useful, she wouldn't mind burning to the Buddha every day, and praying sincerely.
Mommy.
Rin quietly appeared on the balcony, a soft smile, his face thin a lot, did not have the feeling of such a flesh call, a little grown-up appearance, but as a mother, but feels outwardly lonely, I hated he was always a childlike cute look.
Why haven't you slept so late?
Jian Ya, fearing that she might actually push him into the chest, moved a distance, rather than complaining,
"No," she said.
Mom, don't be so careful.
"My mom," "I'm a natural bug," "You'll let me go."
Miss Chang replied, What?
Can't sleep?
Have I got a sister,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
At a time when she did not know how to answer, to tell the truth, to be afraid of disappointment, to be false and not what she wished, she hesitated for three seconds, choosing to tell the truth.
Don't hope too much. There's a dad and a mom. Don't say a sister.
"Mom, don't you talk so funny? "I don't want a brother, I want a sister.
He had to think of one thing: love, bread.
O O O O.
"Well, then, sister."
She looked forward to the child's safety, and when the three leaves were awakened, she was sure to be surprised. She wondered whether he would be able to say a word or two about the pain I had endured overnight.
It's awful.
"Mom," I said, "I find you are a bit of a man and a woman."
"No," he said.
She likes her daughter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Well, you always say brother."
Little Cougar looked down on Anna, pointing out the most direct evidence that he had not heard from the beginning that she was a sister, and that he liked her.
Liar Drop.
Didn't your aunt say? The tradition of the leaves is the rise and fall.
Jiang-Anyary blamed herself, and it was absolutely wrong for her to take a heavy man and light woman.
Who makes a son more beautiful than a girl, more than a daughter, more than a daughter.
"You're going to live," she said. "You're going to go live," she said.
Cheng's face was black, and he wasted his time, and he thought his idea was very good.
When I'm a pig, I don't want to live.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
There's no problem with the white night and the suman.
"I'm sure they'll turn her into a snow-white princess even if she's got an Otterman sister. "
Cheng,
A Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good
Son, it is blind trust, Miss Cheung asked in the sky.
"I'm still hoping you'll be all right and then I'll have a good deal with Louis," said the little bottle.

"Oh, Louis..."
He looked up at the moon. Isn't he gone?
"I'm trying to find out," he said, "as long as my ability goes to the next level, I won't have to hesitate.
"The way Louis is hiding now," said the little bottle, "the way the Blacks are hiding is because they are perfectly hiding, because they are better than him in the field of technology, and for the past few days they have been trying to break their limits.
There's nothing good about it.
"Well, you'll do it yourself," said Cheng, softly, knowing that there had to be a price to pay for the death of the promise, that he would not have stopped if he had counted all the bills on Louis' head, and had not taken Louis to the funeral of the promise.
You can leave now.
"It's all right here," said Joan. "It's not too much for the Black Eagles to come."
What's going to happen, you're safe, I can rest assured.The little milk bag smiled.In my mind, or Mommy's first, how can I take no notice of Mommy's for revenge
That's not possible.
"Well, don't make Mom happy," she said, "I'm going to train your little sister after my wife forgets her little daughter."
Who would have believed that little milk had no denied, but said, "Women also have husbands who forget their daughters, Mommy, you are all like this, and you educate your sisters,
The upper and lower beams are twisted.
Joan was so stuck in her milk bag that she couldn't say a word, and half a while she held it out, "So say, this is the best cup in the world.
Little Milk Pack
A.
It's a little serious.
"Mom, I love you the most in the world," said the little milk.
At her heart hurt, yes, she knew that the son loved her most, because the one he loved most was gone.
Joan did not feel like her son was taken away, but rather very painful.
"I know."
Joan smiled,,My baby,you have a sweet mouth tonight.
"Mom is pregnant, I am glad. "The little milk bag laughed, and Cheng Anja shook her head.
Hope your dad wakes up tomorrow. I'm a little expecting his reaction.
Daddy will say,Yeah,you two old boys haven't had enough of the world,and there'll be another light bulb.The little milk bag imitated the shape of the leaf three little explosives, but it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good.
Baby, you've learned too much.
The estate is a bit like ancient aristocratic houses, with modern designs, and also with ancient garden designs, The Suman private garden is a bit like a small garden garden.
The appearance of the house is also antique design, like a flat, but to the person feel very expensive, still is a white玉 for the wall, Ryuchi for the tiles, under the roof there are a lot of white玉 lanterns, to the person feel a very elegant.
There were all kinds of strange plants in the garden, strange varieties, and at night, when you look at them, you don't look at them, and when you look at them, you don't look at them, and when you look at them, you don't look at them, and when you look at them.
It's just a smell in the yard, it's refreshing.
"What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?" "What is this?"
He reached out curiously, trying to touch, and heard a soothing sound pass through the night, "If you don't want to die, you'd better not touch.
His voice was as cold as the ice in winter. If a man were to be drowned by the cold in the hot summer, he shrugged at night.
It's dead. It's a poison?
Has anyone planted poisoned flowers in their own house?
Kind of weird.
"What are you looking for me?" asked Suman coldly. He stood in the moon, and his face grew and strengthened.
The Beautiful.
Thinking at night, is his cold temper against him?
He's very self-aware, so many days together, obviously the relationship is warmer, didn't think to give up again, really...
It's too unexpected.
"I'm here to study with you," she smiled softly, "I'm here to study with you.
CHAPTER 382
Suman, as if he hadn't imagined that she would be pregnant, his eyes froze, and Suman's eyes gleamed at the night,
"You're not calling yourself a genius?
Didn't find out the last few days?
It's a name.
The gentle smile of a spring, the gentle eyebrows of a warm wind, of no concern to Suman's irony, What do you say of me?
You didn't see.
The last time I checked her was eight days ago, when she was pregnant for two days, and the reaction was not at all obvious, and all their attention was on the virus, who would have noticed she was pregnant?
Even if more serious examinations are limited, Suman's laboratory is studying viruses, and there are no more detailed reactions in blood analysis.
It's not a gynecology. It's odd who can find out.
This has nothing to do with his medicine.
Soman hum,I'm not a doctor.
Susan puts all her responsibilities into one single word. She is not a traditional doctor, so she does not have a diagnosis.
And if you're a genius and you don't get a diagnosis, then you're definitely not going to get a home.
Silence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Susan obviously didn't know how to write these two words, her lips softened, "Pregnancy has nothing to do with viruses, and how to get rid of the poison is how to get rid of the poison.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

His eyes were squinted, and he thought about the problem, that, unlike other viruses, he could change the gene cells of the human body, and he was a little worried that the child might actually be a human, or a heterogene.
That's definitely a cup.
But now everyone expects a child, and suddenly tells that to beat is too cruel.
What if the child is not infected with the virus
asked.
Suman laughed,You need to ask this stupid question?
What kind of genius are you? What kind of genius are you?
This kid grew up in a group of viruses, and you're lucky to say he didn't get infected?
"So beautiful, medical judgments are not necessarily 100 percent accurate," he said.
White Night was not afraid of Suman's ridicule, and made his own judgments lightly.
Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She She

It's beautiful.
Moreover,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you
Why doesn't he call himself a beauty?
What's the difference?
It was as if you could see what was going on in the night, and it was cooler in the spirit of the Suman, and it was a very frightening spirit.
He knew the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm here to find out about Anna and her child. I'd rather have this child, wouldn't you?
White Night brings out the killer, they are all lovers.
He did eat candy when he was very young, but the key was that the child was very affectionate, otherwise he wouldn't have been so hard trying to protect the three and a half.
"It's going to have to wait for the baby to get checked, and if it's infected, it's mostly not, and it's extremely unstable, and it's possible that it's going to change throughout the pregnancy, and it's going to have other effects," Suman said.
The odds are that virus will combine with the cells to give rise to a superhuman child, perhaps more terrifying than Nine, but the odds are very small, and even if adults are not able to combine the cells with the virus, the chances for an unborn baby are very small.
Silence, said Suman, he understood.
"If you're infected with a virus, can you dissolve the tube?"
asked.
"Eighty percent may not be enough. It's not the first, it's not the second, it's the natural virus.
said Suman softly, like a man who drinks poison from a young age, she will become a poison.
It doesn't work at all.
I wasted at night.
"You can't make it," he asked in the dark. He touched his chin and laughed a little crazy. "Who's telling me I'm a fake, and that's what you are, too
I have a specialty, which is not my strength.
Sue's eyes flickered, not positive answer,
"I know," he said. "I'll tell you tomorrow."
He stood straight in the moon, and the whole man seemed to be in the ice of the moon, as if he were in the ice of the moon.
The night stood still, and looked at Suman with a smile, and his face was as calm as the face of the lake in March, as if he had not heard his words.
Suman laughed, his eyes like snow, What else?
"What are you still angry about?
"I didn't mean," said lightly at night. "You've got it too, and it's time to go."
His tone, but with a touch of deterrence, that is not less than Suman.
He knows why Sue is so uncomfortable.
The White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White White
Naturally, he was extremely heated and arrogant, only to be integrated into his vacuity, to give a man a kind of royal misconception.
Suman was lazy, he was noble, and he was a convergent man, but not a convergent one that almost blended into a smile at night.
His inner convergence was covered with frost.
It's cold.
"Don't say anything," he said.
Suman said coldly, very unkind.
He smiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Suman's cold eyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They remembered the accident in the laboratory today.
Almost eight days were spent alone, working together to find a cure for the virus, with the help of the white night, Suman spent a lot of time, and his ability to solve the poison was indeed good, but there were places where it was not as good as the white night.
After all, there is a speciality in the arts, and they both study different directions, so each has a long, mutual compensation.
Superman was very unwilling to see the White Night, because he felt that the White Night had a heart for him, and he felt that he was unwilling to see the White Night, because he had that crazy capital, and he was very unwilling was very unwilling was very unwilling to see the night, because he was very unwilling was unwilling very unwilling very unwilling very unwilling to see at night, because he was unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling unwilling
But gradually, a few days of struggle, he also knew that the white night was not a name, the people were also a real material, in the field of medicine really talented, the two co-operated very quietly, and gradually had a topic, the relationship warm and much.
Heroes are always humble, and more than that they are always a genius in their own fields.
Once you're familiar with speaking, there's no taboo. This day, when two big men, one of them being gay, suddenly raise this topic, it's very embarrassing.
Suman obviously didn't want to say too much, and at night he was curious, and he didn't ask.
Who knows? Suman lost his hand when he broke a bottle of test.
There's a bridge in every TV series, where a man falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls, falls
It's a television,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a very classic jq lens. can not be used on suman and white night, why?
He could walk as though he had fallen, and even though he had fallen, he could still stand up. However, at the moment when he realized he had fallen over Suman,
It's awful if it's like this. Suman can't get his hands off.
Well, there's nothing to do with falling over. Surman's not too angry.
Most importantly, this is a classic shot, which is a kiss, without a kiss it is not a classic shot, it is not at all a surprise,
She's just coming up to kiss.
And there was no stop from falling to touching, and to be honest, people thought that she was an accident, but Suman was a man, and at night, he was more than anybody.
He paused for four seconds and raised his hand to give the White Night a kiss.
At that moment, Suman cried aloud, he felt clearly the light of the middle of the night had changed, he did not know well, and tried to push him, but could not come.
It's the first time you've been treated like this.
It's nothing but a trick, a temptation, and a deceit, and at least Vivi never touched his lips.
A kiss for a kiss of a beauty, this business is actually not a loss.
Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan Susan
Who knew that beauty turned her face and isolated her.
Is it you are looking for death? Suman squinted dangerously, and coldly pressed, to mention the matter, and to think of the amazement of the white eyes, he felt severely insulted.
If he's looking for death, he doesn't care for all of him.
They've just raised the subject of homosexuality, and at night they joke that homosexual lovers have hardly been for a long time, and that they're all just looking for something new, which has made Suman very uncomfortable.
But there's no denying that's true.
He also knew that night was different from him, he liked women, he was a straight man.
What does he mean to him? To look fresh, to look beautiful?
He was a man who was not ashamed of being gay, but was a woman by another man.
For the first time in his life he was so uncertain.
"No," he smiled, "I want to live a hundred years."
Susan hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum
Come on, said he, and let go of his sleeves, and leave a cold shadow on the night.
Standing in the evening,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
White Night is very doubtful.
Today, why to kiss him at night is not clear, as if it were an involuntary move, falling that moment, between the noses, are the cold smells he has been very familiar these days.
It was a shame to have a fragrance in a great man, but Suman wasted all the time on the grass, and in the yard there was this cold fragrance.
So close,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was not until the night came to realize what I was doing, had felt the warm touch on the lips, and so kissed.
If it's an accident, then it's not. He's deliberate.
When he looked at the beautiful garden at night, he was a little confused, and he had no idea why he had gone out of the garden of Suman, but he had not noticed that Suman's cold eyes were always looking at his distant back.
Hey!
Soman, hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum hum
There was a smile across the corner of the man's lips.
It seemed to have seen a hunter throw himself into a net.
Chapter 383
The next day, the lab.
She looked closely at night into the body of three leaves, the translucent liquid flowing like an ice fountain, her heart a bit cool, even her limbs a bit cold, her hands a lot of cold sweat, and looked very tightly at the reaction of the three leaves on the table.
It's not the first time Suman and White Night have tried three drugs in the last few days, but they've been the first to try them on mice. The first two mice died and the second one didn't react.
This time there was a reaction in the mouse, and after Susan's analysis, the toxins in the blood disappeared completely within an hour.
In other words, this is a cure, at least in mice.
Because he had a child, they could not guess what the solution would do to the human body, only to test it on the leaves, and his life had been very limited.
You've got to inject drugs.
Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With less than three leaves, it's not going to last that long.
Little Cheese and Cheng Anya know this is their last chance, and if they don't, let's see today.
After the solution was injected into the leaf, all looked quietly at the graph on the screen, the supply of the tranquilizer has stopped temporarily, the leaf is now only carrying oxygen mask, the rest of the tests have been withdrawn,
But look at the reaction this time.
White Night to the leaves, ther, from the pulse judge, extremely peace, because the tranquilizer has just withdrawn, he has not yet the first sign of awakening, so the pulse presents a state of peace.
But half an hour later, he didn't have a very clear response.
The Virus Virus Virus Virus Virus Virus Virus Virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus virus
White Night explained to them that black indicated the area where the virus entered, and that from the graphics, the liver, the stomach, the spleen were all infected with the virus, and very severely, and that the body was almost filled with the terror of the virus, and that they were in a state of alienation and mutation.
After injection, a small red bubble appears on the screen, continuously crashing into the black areas, Cheng Yan and others have just seen the demonstration of the mouse, after about ten minutes, the black areas will gradually fade and gradually disappear.
represents the virus is being destroyed.
For half an hour, there was no change in the body, only the red bubbles constantly hit the black area, like the game of justice and evil, Justice is very willing to kill evil, but unable to do it, unable to do it.
His chest looked at the screen, almost holding breath, for the first time felt so nervous, wasn't it the cure?He took a breath of coolness in his heart, and in his precise calculations, there would be a reaction after fifteen minutes, why no reaction at all?
Even the little rats begin to fuse with the virus in only ten minutes.
It's not working.
There was a thin sweat between the dark eyes of the night.
Suman sat quietly in front of the computer, looking coldly at the screen, he looked very calm, could not see a bit of panic, like half an hour without a reaction is normal, not to panic.
Comman's heart washed with cold sweat, and he knew that if the cure did not work this time, there would be no doubt that the three leaves would die, and that if he and the white night were to work on the cure for a second, there would be no result in three or five days.
Jay can wait he can't wait.
The five of the noble man wasted, he didn't look back and know what the person behind looked like.
Cheng Yan and others dare to disturb Suman and White Night, deeply afraid to interrupt their thoughts, Ye and 11 squeezed the lips, and also waited tightly, the small milk bag accompanied Che Cheng Yan Yan, afraid that his mother at some point will not endure such torture.
Waiting between life and death is the most painful, in such a case, is thinking of no hope.
The little bottle looked at Daddy not far from the operating room, eyes showed pain, he had just recognized Daddy less than six months,
He didn't want to lose him, the fools look at the hands of others always say, you must have died in ten years of love.
A later survey revealed that most people died within the age of 10
It's grandpa, it's mom, it's grandma, etc. He's lost Nono.
So he's lost a loved one, So Daddy, must live.
If he died, his mom would probably die and die, and he wouldn't be happy for life.
Dad,you gotta stay.
He was always very confident about Suman and White Night, but he didn't know how nervous he was until this crucial moment.
Anya, standing alone, with her hands at the edge of the table, her eyes staring at the screen like a torch, deeply afraid of a leak, she prayed so hard that the cure could work quickly.
"White Night," said Suman.
White's eye froze, and he didn't ask again, and injected him to know the medicine.
In fact, this solvent is also a poison, if not the leaf three small body virus, a single injection solvent is sufficient to poison a person within a minute, so the weighting is also a certain risk, a little calculation error rather than the solvent death.
"White Night, what's going on, and why is there no reaction?"
YV asked nervously, Isn't it heartbreaking?
Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait
He told you would wake up in an hour, and if he didn't wake up, he would die.
But you've been waiting for an hour, and he's not awake yet.
It's like hoping tos a drop through your fingernails.
Suddenly, there was a ringing on the operating room, and the hands of the three were moving, and he seemed to want to get rid of his chains, but he was caught, and he was hurrying, pulling hard, pulling hard, and moving very hard.
Everyone was astonished, and Sudman quickly analyzed the mechanics of his body on the computer, and Leth was at first humming, like receiving something painful, and his head was shaking, and his body was trying desperately to get rid of the clamp, and Cheng Anya and Leth Wei were trying to get past but were stopped at night.
Suddenly, there was a roar, "Oh..."
Closed eyes for ten days, opened, dark eyes full of blood, scared, hands and feet began to struggle fiercely, constantly mad, screaming, as if mad.
Their eyes were filled with bitterness.
With her mouth tight, her heart was like a knife, she could not see, she looked at the table with her eyes closed.
His crazy voice still passed through his ears.
Achen
"Dad..."
My brother...what's wrong?
Eva was astonished, "Soman, what's wrong with me?
"The cure begins to respond. "
"If he had withdrawn his sedative, he would have been in pain," said Suman, softly
It's a normal reaction.
Besides, we have added weight, he will be more painful.
said the White Night.
Isn't Dad going to be okay?
"You can't die with a reaction," said Suman, who had his hands busy testing all the indicators in the leaf, while ordering him to inject several tests at night.
It's cool. It's strong.
Their hearts were much more relaxed when they heard that they could not die.
They were outside, they could not understand, but they knew that the pain of the three leaves seemed to have been reduced, and that cry that seemed to have been taken out of all the bowels was a little terrifying.
It was a little scary, it sounded dull, and his hands and feet were tied together with a cord, and blood was flowing, and bones were visible, as if they were embedded in his bones.
De De De De De De De De De De De De De De De
"It'll be all right, Dad," you hold on. "The little milk bag shakes," he said.
"He can't hear," said the White, smiling, "I can't feel anything at the moment, except pain and dying dizziness, which lasted for almost ten minutes.
Only then did therapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprap
At the same time, the leaf three little body slowly out a layer of sweat.
His roar wasted away, and turned into a painful hum.
At last, White gave him a serum, completed the last step of understanding the poison, the leaves were less tired, and fell asleep.
It was a hurry to get past and to stop at night.
Don't get hooked again.The next one is for you.
Cheng Anja's foot wasted,
Really?
Is He OK?
"Yes," he said.
"Great," Yves applauded, and the room was filled with cheers, and even the corner of Suman's lips was filled with laughter.
After such a horrible detoxification process, the little milk packed with anxious, "Will my mother be as painful as my father?
"No," he smiled at night.
CHAPTER 384 Children under the Virus
The treatment was not painful, like the usual injection. After the injection, the whole person fell asleep, and then lay on another operating table.
From an inside view, almost all of the viruses in the body are concentrated in the direction of the uterus.
As was expected by the night, Ye had said, the condition of Anya was very strange, not at all like that of the virus, and he asked her, when she was first on the island of Louis, that it was not at all, that she would also be sick, with no strength, and with pain in her intestines.
This happened when they were at Prince William's Castle, which means that the child was slowly absorbing the virus, and that the child was growing up in the same way.
Suman said yes, he didn't look at the inside, but he knew that the child must have been infected.
"Do you dare this child to take the virus as a nourishment?" Levy looked at the inside view, very shocked, eyes wide open, a bit unbelievable, and a little worried.
This picture is a little scary.
It should be.
said White Night, feeling a bit shaken, the child was in the womb during the course of the virus, and the child was born to carry the virus,
Don't tell me what the virus will do to him. If it comes out, isn't everyone going to get it?
Suman's eyebrows twisted, and he saw little of the beauty's eyebrows; Ye, the eleven, and the little milk; and the three sleep together quietly, without any sense; and the four sleep without any sense;
They were very nervous.
"Soman," asked the little milk.
"I don't know for a while," said Suman, clapping his hands, "I don't know for a while," he said, "I'm sure it's infected," and "I don't know if it's going to be any problem," he said, "I don't know if it's going to be any problem."
Therapeutic treatment was taking place, slowly eliminating the virus in her body, she did not have the severe pain of the leaves, but lay quietly, as if asleep, with a little calmness.
"White Night," I heard the old witch say, "isn't there a reason for the wolf to test the poison?"
Eve suddenly asked, remembering the things many years ago, the eyes twisted more tightly.
"A poison," said Suman.
There is one thing, said the wolf, who once bred the babies as poisons, and from what they ate at birth they had a great deal of poison, a dozen children, a dozen who died, and three who lived
Later, all of their foods were poisoned, and two people died during their growth, and only one survived.This child, very different from the ordinary child, was a poisoned carrier, and anyone who touched him would be poisoned and died.
It takes a few months to get the serum, and the gas he breathes is poison.
"It's cruel."
Little Cheese, how can have such a cruel man?
His No was in the hands of the wolf, which had not cultivated her as a poison, such a pain is absolutely not to be endured by the common man.
"It's really cruel," she said, "and then the old witch imprisoned her child, so that she and the wolf could have a quarrel.
Their success is so low that many people who die are able to grow one, and the food of the poison is very poisonous, and the normal diet, if it lasts long enough, will be fatal because of the lack of toxins, he said quietly at night, and this is what they have just heard, and whatever they have heard in the camp must be believed, and it is absolutely true.
If so, if the virus disappears, will the child die?
It's too complicated, and she feels too deep, too unintelligible.
"I've heard of it, but it's not like it's with children," Suman said, "If children grow up, it means that the virus has fused with the children's cells.
Look at him, though he's not yet shaped, but he's growing,
It's not like poison, it's possible to control the virus, and if he doesn't have the virus, he's destined for nothing with the world, said Suman.
White Night also injected her serum.
It's a good thing, but it's a good thing, it's a good thing.
Eve,,,,BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
Suman and the little lamb walked to the end, the little lambmb smile said, Suman, this is really hard for you.
"A small thing," said Suman, his hands on his shoulder.
The little bottle smiled, and Sumanla sat down on his chair in the courtyard. It was a dark day today, and the temperature was a little low, and the courtyard was not too hot.
asked Suman, When will you go?
They certainly can't stay long, Long, the first terrorist organization, the Black Party are in the most confused, the most nervous phase, no one knows who will laugh to the end, definitely can't stay too long.
All of them, some of the core of the terrorist organization, some of the core of the Longmen, have to think about how to deal with the blackmail of the Party and of the coalition of governments,
The second half is expected to be very volatile.
"I'm going to ask you this question, my mom will have any problem,
Will the kid with the virus release the mother again poison?
The little bottle thinks carefully about this.
"No, they have antibodies, and the same virus has no effect on them," said Suman.
"I've been thinking about this for a long time," he said, "and if anything happens, it'll happen to the children, and not to the adults.
The worst intention is to take away the child.
Give him a little head, and he'll be safe.
"I'm just worried about Mommymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymy
His face was slightly darkened, and he was about to find Louis' hiding place.
"On the power line, the first terrorist organization is the old, the black party old two, the Longmen old three, the old two want to get rid of the old, no one can, certainly will pull the old three," said Suman, smiling
He is not enough, but sees the situation, these things can not hide from him.
The Little Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk
The Black Party also divided North America, and terrorist organizations will also be thirty, and by the time it really becomes a mountain two tiger situation, it will not be possible to do anything else.
Of course, on the premise that he can swallow North America.
Suman smiled.
When the first milk came, he was busy with the virus, and had no time to talk.
We're about to go. Soman's a little uncomfortable.
But after all he's a scatter, it's just a coincidence. Moreover, in the future, there will surely be a lot of scatter.
"It's really calm," he said. "It's been so many days,
Lewis should have known that my parents were not in Riyadh. It's strange.
He'd like to get you into a cage, get him to throw himself into the net, get all the Longmen and the First Terrorist out of Riyadh, and leave Eve and Eleven, and Louis didn't do anything, so he was surprised.
"Have you taken the world," said Suman softly, "and think of the little milk.
Suddenly asked Suman, Hasn't the last gun been made?
"You say a high-speed magnetic pulse.
"Your design is too hard to make, and many of them are failures, one success.
But it might be easier to build later.
That's good. I thought it would take another month or two.
Their backup force is very strong.
"Of course," said the little dairy, "because it was the first person to test a gun at night.
It's awful how powerful it is to blow it up at the speed of a fighter.
"It's close to light."
Suman laughed, this was his three years of heart, designing his best work.
If it were sold on the road, it would have been cheap, and the result would have been cheated by the small milk bag.
White Night was the first to test a gun.
The little milk, with a smile, the dark eyes, with a little cheat, So beautiful, why do you have such an opinion of the night
Our house is the most subtle terrorist organization, very handsome, the best man of temper, blossoms, you are like a jewel, what a good adjective, what a nice.
Are you selling your stalls?
Suman turned his head, and his cheerful face smiled, for the relationship of the angle was beautiful, and this time there was more of an astonishing beauty,
All the little milks shouted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and he could not help touching Suman's chest with his hands.
Hard.
Poor Poor Poor Poor Poor Poor Poor Poor Poor Poor Poor
Suman smiled as he touched, his face with light tolerance, "You are a man, and your behavior is the same.
Eve did not know how many times she had touched his chest to confirm that he was a man and a woman.
"You're really bad," said the little milk bag, laughing.
"What a sellout, our house is a sellout.
"The quality, appearance, utility, etc. is absolutely not to say, or a multi-functional product.
Suman laughed, too the metaphor.
The little milk was perfect, and for the first time he smiled and showed his teeth.
The scene seen on the far balcony of the villa and in the eyes of the white night, that is a rape four shots.
Soman smiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's too much.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh.
"You're thinking too much, aren't you sure you'd rather be rude to him?"
He laughed, and went downstairs.
Levy took a look at her eyebrows, followed by a quick step, and asked, on the shoulder of White Night, do you have any interest in the beauty of Sue?
I like beautiful.
Ye, what do I want to suggest to Su?
"A" is not a beautiful.
Beautiful, that's different than beautiful.
Come on, don't hit your mouth.
"You don't want a beauty," he said with a smile, "let her circle his neck," he didn't realize he was too close.
Rather,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Otherwise, Levy and 11 have been together for more than a dozen years, how can it be that Jason has loved 11 when he was younger, but he can't do it later, when his family is better than his lover.
Because it's too early.
"No," he said.
"I still like Sue a little more," said Eve with a grin.
She kept her mouth shut.
White Night was a reminder to her that, as long as I and Anya were awake, we were almost to leave Lyia, and that there must be a hard battle, and that you should be well prepared, for I know that you are not going to be emotionally useful, but there are many things that are better for you to wake up, lest you be ruined.
White was worried about her, too.
M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M
You don't believe in slaves?
Eve twisted his arm,I'm like selling to you?
Don't mess with me. I'm worried about you.
"It's dangerous," he smiled softly. "It feels like you're not an opponent.
"Yes, but the slave is not his opponent?"
As for mind, men are stronger than women.
"You see Anya is so smart," he said with a smile. "I think it's easy to get along," he said.
"You're a gender discriminator.
"I'm just disrespecting you, in all, be careful."
"You know the slaves are not going to let you down.
She smiled, and the two happened to be in the court, and she came together, and kissed her white cheek in all manner of ways, and said in a low voice, "I appreciate you.
At night I couldn't cry, I looked up and suddenly saw Suman and the little milk.
Suman was still, his eyes were cold, and at a glance there was no soft smile in front of the small milk, just a cold hum.
CHAPTER 385
The night was dark, and the moon jumped from the balcony, and broke the silver; and in the room there was a shining lamp, and the light was soft, and the eyes were not touched, as though a thin veil had passed, and the whole room was warm.
The poison was, she knew, and she thought, when she injected her poison at night, that if she did not wake up, she would fall asleep and die unconsciously, without feeling any pain, as it is often said, a happy death. She laughed at herself, thinking of all these things in her mind at that time, but in that moment, her mind was relaxed.
After all, she knew, that the young man would be safe, even if he died, the only regret was the child.
Dead is not a good thing.
She laughed, and turned, and saw her three little leaves sleeping by her side, warm and melting in her womb, warm to her bones.
Their room was still their room, but they changed a bed, and the silk was warm and cold, and baked the temperature of the body, and felt that the pores of the whole body were stretched out, very comfortable.
Perhaps it was because they were poisoned, she had no need to restrain herself, she had no need to infect innocent people, she had no need to kill her relatives, and for a few days, she seemed to be at ease, as she was always talking to them about the heavens, but her heart was very heavy, and from the death of Zhang Po, the giant stone had been pressed against her head, and she had been driven out of breath at midnight.
It's a heart disease, and she wants to be isolated from the crowd, and she's afraid of innocent death.
Now that big stone has been crushed, her heart is a lot loose, I know, a light feeling, really comfortable, like a resurrection.
There was a slight breath of leaves, and when he was healed, his face was grim, as if the scene of madness had gone away, and she only knew that he was now resting and at rest.
All things are worthy of thee; and thou shalt hear the words of men, saying, Thou shalt not die, but thou shalt be blessed.
How many times have they suffered, how many times have they jumped in the desert, how many times have they been trapped in the desert, how many times have they been killed in the castle, how many times have they been blown to pieces in the sea, how many times have they been wandering by death, and how many times have they been wandering by viruses, and how many times have they been safe, and how many times have they been safe?
I hope so.
Dean knew that Louis had not died, that the Black Party had not been traced, that Longmen had been changed a great deal in the previous days, and that all had been manipulated by men behind the scenes, in an attempt to stir up a bloody storm again, and that all had not been heard, and that she had been well acquainted with the analysis and discussions of the Little Cougar and Levy.
There will be a greater wave after this cure, she only hoped, having tasted so many pains among men, had tasted all the pains of his life.
I'll be there later.
With a sigh she touched his brows.
Her eyebrows were thick, her shape was beautiful, her eyes were closed, her eyelashes were lengthened, from the side of her face, and her eyes were slightly curved, and her eyelids were covered with a thin shade. Her nose was high, her lips were beautiful, her five senses were exquisite, like God's exquisite.
The Master's fingers crossed his lips, a little dry, reminding him of the burning of the lips, and with a moment of astonishment, he turned his fingers, and knew not what he would have done if he had known that she had touched him in the dark.
Little did she look at his five organs so attentively, and in her mind she thought of him as he was, as he was angry, as he was black, as he was beset, and so on, and so on, and so on.
The laughter washed over the lips.
"Do I have such a good laugh?" "I have such a good laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh
When did he wake up? When did he wake up? When he thought of his long fingers brushing over his five senses, his fingers heated and his face burned.
"Are you awake?"

"It's just a skin injury," he said, looking at his wrists and at his wrists.
He remembered in his hallucinations of his madness, with the sound of metal banging on his ears, but at the time the pain seemed insignificant, and he had no impression.
"The skin wound must be treated, and you mustn't be disturbed," said Cheng. He took the medicine aside, and took the cloth and gave it to him again.
With astonishment, he looked hastily at Anya's hands, and she was safe.
Cheng Anja nodded, and told the matter again, and spared the child only one thing, and she did not know how to tell him the thing, and she took the medicine, and she rebounded him.
"You haven't answered my question. "Lee tries tos his head into the near-head.
If you dare to watch him laugh, you should.
"Can't I be happy? " "It's too happy to be laughing," he said.
Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li
"It's been nine days," said Cheng.
She's been worried for nine days.
Especially at the time of the cure today, especially the feeling of wandering on the edge of despair, even more in the bone of memory, she will never forget the waiting torment, more difficult than any time.
Li looked at her eyes, and said, For so long, you should kiss me, learn to kiss the prince.
He leaned over his mouth and kissed.
With his palm he pulled to the other side, laughing and cursing, "Where are you like the princess?"
You're crazy.
Li also laughed, had a little heavy atmosphere suddenly spread, a joy.
Shearararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararararar
Suddenly, with his arms pressed into his arms, Leth had become the chief objector, drilled into her lips, kissed her deeply, swept through her lips every inch of softness, rolled the tip of her tongue, sucked a little bite, enjoyed the joy of resurrection after death, lost and recovered excitement.
Everyone is well when they fall asleep, maybe more than wake up prepared, with the other complex emotions, can now live, whose heart is not moved, happy.
It's a precious thing.
Joan closed her eyes to enjoy his kiss, her familiar smell in her nose, her eyebrows passing, the wind blowing, the room filled with tenderness all over the sea.
As if the kiss were not enough, the leaves were not enough, and as soon as they had let her breathe, they had covered her lips, and hesitated to kiss, and his lips were as hesitated and as mighty as those of his people.

He kissed her,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This feeling, a little strange, and a little familiar, that day and night in the desert castle, I have had so many times, that even the tips of my fingers seem to be powerless, and in his arms become a pool of spring water.
You're Going.
"Anya..." The low, dull voice rose slowly, the burning breath was poured on the delicate skin between Anya's necks, the snow was dyed with pink, the wet kiss went down, took her clothes, the touch of the wound, the three leaves briefly hummed.
Anya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
"It's all right.""""It's all right.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
"Yes, I am, I am not dead, I am not in need of these two days."
But it's also a matter of color.
"No, you come?" said the younger of the leaves, blinking his eyes in confusion, with a little darkness, and with a little green gleam of tears, as if he were expecting Miss to lead.
Jiang's face was red, pushing his shoulder, indicating him down,"I won't."
"I'll teach you."
"..."
Miss Cheung's face was more red, and Le leaned down, and said to her ears, Cheng An-ya almost kicked him down, with a thin, embarrassed face, "You little girl, shut up."
Le trembled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Levy and the little milk wrapped slowly, Levy saw her sister-in-law's cheeks red, a face of spring, a face of silk, her brother-in-law's face of dissatisfaction, a face of desolation, she... for the first time felt that the feeling of destroying someone's good is so...
It's cool.
The little milk bag waved goodbye, said Yves, "My brother and sister, you are very good, very good... continue, continue, we will come again in a short time..."
"Well, go on, go on..."
Two large and one small stand without moving means, with a tray in hand, very purely to watch.
Hadn't Jae had a wound to his left foot and kicked him down to the bed, lam, it's a shame...
Ray Ray Ray Ray Ray Ray Ray Ray
It's the feeling being raped in the bed.
"You two are too blind. "It was a little cold," he hummed, "and it came from her, and fortunately there was no monkey who hurried to tear off her clothes, or else it would have been better.
Hey, hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
She and Nine had a good time, and they hadn't eaten a day, and Ye had brought some easy to digest food, and she had been thinking about her family's sisters and sisters' bodies, so that they wouldn't have to ring the bell again.
Who knew this would happen?
The little package was very unexpected, although deeply understood that his father had been hungry for a long time, yet did not think so brave.
Thinking he himself was uncomfortable to let Mommy come, it is really... pollute the pure mind of the underage, the little milk bag is also a bit of a correction.
"Brother, come, drink ice cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's awful to a man who wants to be unhappy.
After being embarrassed, she felt nothing, and with her family, the heart is not strong enough, this thing is not enough to make her panic, and the clothes are not overwhelmed, otherwise she will lose face.
"Mommymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymy

"It's really violent."The little milkbag laughed, dragging Anya to the table, "Mommy, I haven't tasted my baby's handicrafts for a long time, and I'm ready."
The leaves were clouded early.
He's hungry. It's double hunger.
Chapter 386
Once the virus is gone, it is time to talk about leaving Riyadh, and Yves 11 and White Night have negotiated, that they should return to Rome, for a time, to intensify their efforts, and as soon as possible to deal with the resentment between Prince William and Chu.
Today's main task is to deal with the Black Party, most of whom have been distracted by Louis's use of the power of the First Terrorist Organization, they cannot and will not spend too much time with Prince William.
White had contacts with Chu, and when he returned to Rome to explain the matter, he began to mobilize the international forces of the First Terrorist Organization, using the international situation to force Prince William to lower his head, and he did not believe that William would burn the stone for the sake of his face and Chu.
This is the quickest way to solve the problem.
Eleven and Eve of course have something to do, they have to find the brothers and Louis down.
"Daddy, Mom," said the little milk, "will you go with me at night, please?"
That's the main reason why he and Yves are upstairs looking for their parents. If it wasn't for this change, the little milk bag would have been looking for the first terrorist organization, and this was just an opportunity to exercise, he didn't want to miss.
To learn more from their side, this is the way he intends to go to the dark, must learn a whole thing, not always to stay with his parents, and most importantly, he wants to revenge for Nono.
Lewis and the wolf, he didn't want to leave either.
There's nothing wrong with Ying's head, indicating that the object of his son's persuasion is his mother.
Mommymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymy
Jia leaned back, looked deeply at the little milk, for a moment, the little milk also looked quietly at her, very persistent.
What's she's trying to stop now? She decided to let her son fly as soon as she had escaped.
She really couldn't give him the skills he needed to grow up.
"I don't mind if you decide.
Jiang Ya finally accepted.
Levy wasted her mind, and before that, it was a little difficult to convince her, and after this, she herself knew that it was easy to hold back, and she did not know how to thank Louis for giving her such a shocking lesson.
Mommy, you're the best.
The little bottle came and wrapped it around her neck.
"Do what you want to do. You're grown. Mom believes your judgment.
After this, she grew up.
Her son has grown up.
She's got to let go.
His son is a kite in the sky, his mother is this line, always bound him, he will never fly this part of the world, only with the line, he will be able to fly higher, fly farther.
It didn't matter how loose the lines were, as long as the son didn't fall, she would shrink, and eventually come back.
Li looked at the mother, and smiled.
The blessings of his life, were to meet him, to know him, to love him, and to have such an excellent son, which was the blessing of his life, and which he should cherish.
"Dad, Mum, what about you?" asked the little one. "Are you going back to town?"
"I'm going back, I've been away for a month, and Lin and Tang are all worried, that the three of us are going to get together to fight against the Negro Party, that Louis's next game is going to take over North America, and that the Lord of the Rings is going to take over."
No No No No No No No No No No No
Mummy, don't, stay in Riyadh, this is Suman's house, it's forbidden, there's Suman, no one can help you, wait for the situation to settle down, will you go back to a city, please?
Joan shook her head.I don't.I'm going back with you.it's not a deal.
Little Milk knew his mother's personality, and since she had said so, there must be no room for business. He must not look at the leaves.
Shen smiled,This time I will take her for twenty-four hours, never will the same thing be repeated.
In addition, the Longmen's killers will protect them for twenty-four hours, will not go up again so negligent, passive, this time Louis is hard to get near city a.
This, as I see it, is not much better to follow Sango and to stay on the side of the Suman, and now the city is a peaceful belt, and in fact Lydia is a little unsafe, though they are averse to the Suman, but if the three sisters, Louis will burn with a stone.
"We don't have any news about Louis and Major General yet," she said calmly. "I'd rather you'd have a look at their tracks and notified them as soon as they were found by city a."
"It's natural," said the little bottle, holding her hand, "Mommy, baby, you'll never be surprised again."
Before she had a good word, she had a shot of iron, and she had flattened her little chest, and she had covered her pained head, and she had stared at her big eyes, and she had looked at her little chest with regret.
"Dad, are you going to make me a fool?"
"That's what I said. When did you take my speech?"
Xiao, with his eyes n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n

That's not what the little bottle is smart about.
Jiang Ya turned his eyes white, and learned his movement to give him a punch, "You shut me up.
Eva laughed.

"You can be sure," he said, "that's how he's dangerous.
Nothing's gonna happen.
The little bottle laughed modestly.
`Now that's decided, I'll send people to prepare for the plane,' said Levy. `My sister-in-law, if there's anything wrong with you, let Suman know in time.
Don't worry, I know.
"Isn't Anya poisoning?"
The three little voices, heart jump, eyes burning, looking toward Anja, passed a little panic.
Hasn't Sister said? She's got her poison, and she hasn't reacted yet to that.
Eva exits, Cheng Ya wants to stop has not come.
It's been petrified.
CHAPTER 387 The Talk
Less than ten minutes before he was able to digest the meaning of Less Less Less Less Less Less Less Less Less Less Less Less.
When he returned, he drank two cups of hot tea.
Is it a happy fool or is it an angry fool? she wondered curiously, the child came really suddenly, not in their plan, but at last came, she was very happy in her heart.
What about him?
Seeing him so lovingly, she thought, he loved the child most, but his reaction was too long, and she waited almost to wake him up to give him the rest of the reaction.
One's expression hanged for too long, he's not tired, she looked into the people.
Are You Pregnant?
"Well, that night in the desert."
She said softly, with her hands tightened, the man had fallen into his warm arms, his chest pressed down with a big hand, his kiss had fallen, and her lips.
He kissed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A kiss like a storm, which she had not resisted, fell back into his arms, and naturally accepted.
Leth retreated her hand, and kissed him very, very, very hard.
Even though it was not the first kiss, the leaves were not always gentle, but it was the first, so rough, that she even tasted a little salty of blood between her lips.
She sighed, the man will never learn anything to be gentle.
You're not excited.
His breath was almost snatched away from him, and he kissed her cheek, and her ears were white, and her neck and neck were filled with hot air, and her belly was filled with heat, and she was troubled.
She wasted and her skin turned pale pink.
In a moment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The moment felt calm and far away.
Forever.
She knew enough, though each expressed joy in different ways, but she did not correctly admit, she also rather liked the action of the Li Li, the action of the school, in the heart, sweet, sweet.
There is no doubt that is what he likes.
How good it would have been if, seven years ago, Leth had known that she was in peace, what would have been his reaction, more or less a cold face, a cruel undertaking, to strike, if he hadn't.
The difference between compassion and compassion is really big.
"I'm so happy," she said, "I'm so happy," and let go for a long time.
Joan laughed. I was too happy.
Nine Nine.
In the last few days, except for the day, and Ye, and others, close attention to the situation, and exchange of information with the other side of Chu, to study the countermeasures, the small milk bag the rest of the time is drilling for computer technology.
He had to admit that he had a little distance.
It is very difficult to rise again when faced with a barrier.
It's like you've got 100 marks, you've got to go up, you've got no room, the only difference is the perfectness of the roll.
Sometimes you have to pay more.
He's a genius, and he's destined to go one step faster than any other, and any difficulty can do half as much, as this time, even though he hasn't reached the level of his own.
But at least he knew that was not true, and in a moment he would be able to defeat the two brothers, and in this field he would be the last king.
When he came, he was still busy.
Father would rather stop his work and look at the clock
It's morning. "Dad, why haven't you slept?"
What about you? Didn't you sleep?
Ying sat down next to Ning, and when he saw the computer, he rubbed his son's head, "Don't play too much.
It doesn't matter. Little Milk smiles.It's an invitation to the brothers, and I'm not tired, but rather very passionate, Daddy, I'll soon be able to overcome them,
It's not difficult to get Louis by the time.
It was difficult for him to sleep at night, and when he slept, he dreamed of a promise, and his red dress was like a fire rose, and he laughed, but he could not touch it.
He woke up in a lonely place. He was afraid of this, and he could hardly sleep at night, except for sleep aids.
Exactly. There's a lot of time with the brothers.
Ye smiled,I believe you.
Why don't you go with Mommy?
"She fell asleep," said Ya, looking at her son with a smile, "Daddy, do you have anything to say to me?"
It's not too late. Dad's gonna come and see him.
"This time leave us, and be careful, you know? For Louis, I know you hate him, but don't try to revenge, or you'll lose your way.
He was always anxious in his heart, and he could feel that his son had changed, and he could not feel that he had changed, even though he had been the first of his kind in the sight of them.
He's always worried, He's got too much hatred in his heart, to hurt himself.
How much he hated Louis at this moment, how much he wanted to kill, how much he wanted to do, how much he was lost.
A man who is too attached to something will always have a negative effect, and once he has done it, he will have to find something else to support him.
Promise will never come back. His heart will never be healed. He is afraid that his son will go further on this path of vengeance.
After all, it is self-destructive.
That's what he talks about.
For so many years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Father, I don't understand what you are saying.
Ning elegantly smiled, still seemed a little tender fingers on the keyboard gently knocked, without purpose, eyes looked out to the window, not to see the three leaves.
You don't understand, but no one can understand.
Never lost, never understood this heartbreaking despair, he thought occasionally, alone on the balcony, of the sky of Lyhad, of the slaughter of the Negroes, that perhaps his heart's hatred might be lessened.
His heart became cruel.
"You don't understand," replied Ying in a low voice. "My son is too smart, too early," he said. "My father's way of being with him has always been like being with friends," he said. "He has never spoken so seriously to Ninening, nor has he ever been angry with him.
This son is perfect.
He won't make you angry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's because it's so smart, it's harder to worry about.
Quiet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Their eyes turned, as if they were caught by a ghost.
The room was very quiet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Be quiet, you've grown up, and you haven't listened to me?"
The silence of his guess.
Father, I know.
He said with a soft voice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Just...
"Well, if you punish yourself, the death of the promise is meaningless at all," said Ye, quietly, "if it were your mother, she would certainly not have liked me to be a cruel man who only knows hatred and does not know love."
Don't you know how to love? Maybe, I hear hate too long, I really don't know how to love, Louis died, I'm afraid doesn't solve his heart's hate, but after, who will he hate?
For the first time, Nine felt that Ychen's image in his heart, became so high.
The hand on his shoulder, too, became so strong.
Father, I know.
Le tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre tre.
He said, Get up and go.
He stared quietly at the door where the shadow of the leaves had disappeared. He had no idea what it was like to have been talking to him like this for the first time since he had made the promise.
A little angry, but the man is his father, he can not be angry.
It was a little shocking, because Dad hadn't said anything, but at a glance saw his heart.
He felt that child, no matter how big, how smart, in the eyes of the parents, still no cover, anything is exposed.
Previously, he felt that without a father, he could make Cheng Anya's life without trouble.
Knowing Yechen, he liked this father, he took thousands of photos of them, wanting a whole house, actually for him, father, only more one who loves him, and more one who he loves.
He didn't know what the warmth of his heart was at this moment, but after many years he came to realize that the father had played such an important role in his son's life.
Within his subconscious, he listened to his words, and there was nothing to turn against, and went astray.
CHAPTER 4 37
At this time, the blue gold light flash, the light flashed a little, and was guided down to the camera.
But apparently it was not so easy to deal with, and it took away a part of the flame, and then, whispering, flew to one side, and ran out of the range of the blue and silver and gold array.
These few changes very quickly, and it feels rather uncomfortable.
Don't deal with this guy.
We've got to get it out as soon as possible, or the law enforcement will come.
As the burst down, the woman appeared again, with her eyes cast, "What are you doing?
Just as she was speaking, a ring of precious rays flashed on her feet, the woman's body suddenly stiffened.
Tang Ling's blue silver grass washed up in order, the blade before the dragon's sword, pointed to the chest of the opponent, Che Che has quietly reached behind her, the dragon dagger to her neck.
Everything is a trick!
What's better than a tiny star chain to a single opponent?
The Absolute Establishment is the existence of the opposite!
As soon as the people relaxed their voices and thought that they had taken the opponents, the strangeness began! The sword of the stars had come before, the sharpness of the dragon dagger behind had also come to the neck, and the life was threatened, the woman's eyes suddenly brightened.
There was a ringing on her body, and immediately a strong and unbeatable spirit burst out of her body.
It was as if she had been stimulated, and underneath her dress, there was a ring of red light, each ring of red light, but it looked as if it were inside her dress, at her neck, her shoulders, her elbows, her waist, her knees, and so on.
More than had been known before, the soul was lifted up, turned into a circle of giant fire rings, and a thin golden stripe appeared on the fire gourd in the air, which was originally only a foot tall, lifted directly to two feet, several circles larger.
The fierce element fluctuations burst out instantly, the fierce blow hard to fly out a few of the Tang Mai Rin, and the flame burns their souls like the maggots of the bone.
The feather the feather and the feather and the feather and the feather, and the feather and the feather.
There is a certain feather on the head, a dark red feather extended on both sides, a beautiful line extended downwards, arc extended, drawn out the characteristics of a woman, shoulder, soft line wrapped, covering the whole arm.
A dark red flame washed over the armor, and on the chest there was a gold-red image of the Phoenix, which was not particularly gorgeous, but when the armor was covered, the woman's breath had risen several ranks.
"Dou-" "Dou-" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou

No No No No No No No No No No.
But even so, it's a complete one-word armor! Meaning, the original five-circle female, power is directly raised to the seven environments.
D was very angry at this time, she was in a very good mood today, very happy. Just went to the Heavenly transmitting tower, is to register, to register himself as a word fighting archer.
She is the top of any organization willing to provide, just at the time of signing, the transferring to the side promised her a series of welfare policies, she is only twenty seven years this year, in Tianling City is one of the youngest fighters, the future is countless.
The Ring has promised that the future will help her provide a great deal of resources, to help her hit the two-word archer, once she becomes the two-word archer, that is the true archer, has a place in the whole continent.
But who could have imagined that she had just come out of the spirit tower and had been besieged by a group of young men.
And their abilities are quite weak, and if they don't use their armor, they're just really on their way.
She doesn't know Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
At this moment, the sound of the long dance in the ears of the six Tang Mai Lin, "If you can overcome her, the city will even pass you.
Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance
Without waiting for him to think much, Deng Feng had done it. The strong soul power lifted in a moment, his right hand toward Tang Tang, and the fire gourd above his head suddenly poured out a line of fire, and in a moment came before Tang Tang Tang Tang.
It's been done, it's been done, it's been done, it's been done, it's been done, it's been done.
Look at their eyes and they'll know they're angry.
They don't make sense! Let's say it again.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
Confront a true archer, how can he not do everything!
"Dou-" "Dou-" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou--" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou---" "Dou-
It was impossible for three words to appear in her mind.
How old is he? And she could see that Tang's armor had come directly from his body.
It's unimaginable to have an armor at this age, even though it's only one.
When she had her first armor, she was twenty-one, which was also called a genius.
After years of hard work, he finally became a true warrior.
But how big are these little guys?
At the same time as Tang Lin initiated, others also moved quickly.
Xuagashi had gone a long way before, not to mention, each of the bags flew out of his hand, light spirit small cage bag, bloody bean bag, man hand one.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
There's got to be quick.
Even if it is only one word armor, after gathering the whole set, there is also the ability to help the soul master quickly recover the soul power.
They don't have a chance to fight.
With his left foot on the ground, he emitted a blast, and the whole man was shot like a bronze arrow, and his right arm was blocked in front of him, and the blood of his body was stirred up, and the breath of King Jin came out, and his eyes were completely golden, and the blood flowing in his body filled with a bitter taste.
Their right claws against each other's flames, and their front claws against each other.
As a captain, and especially as a strong attacker, he can't go back half now, only if he stays on the front, the partners have a chance.
Under the stimulation of the blood of his own soul suddenly exploded to the top of the whole skin appeared pale gold scales, right hand, right arm and right chest part, scales are particularly splendid.
He's a double?
Daefeng wasted.
There was no escape, and suddenly the burning gourd turned overhead, and the original line of fire turned into a large burst of flame, passing over the head of Tang Mai Lin, covering his companions, and blocking the others.
She wants to isolate Tang Lin, before settling the obvious is the head of the other person say.
Kim's claws flashed in front of the other, Deng Feng's right hand also lifted, clas hands, hard shake face.
Looking as both sides were about to collide, the dragon's voice in Tang Mai Rin suddenly became intense, a giant gold dragon with feet more than two feet in diameter without any signs appeared, directly swallowed the right arm of Deng Feng.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
After eating the red shrimp that day, Tang's own blood, although not able to break the King's Fourth Seal, but had a very great promotion, making him more skilled in controlling the King's surprise.
Dae-feng jumped too, and felt only a strong forward, and soon after, with a fist of her own, the flame was like to be swallowed up, and the claws of the Golden Dragon were like a big plier, and grasped her right hand.
With Jin's claws, the dragon's claws brightened, and all the fireworks on it seemed to come alive, especially the fire dragon at the chest, and it really moved, and turned into a fire dragon's shadow, running straight to Tang Mai Rin's chest.
This is...
CHAPTER IV 38 Sister, I think this is a mistake
At this moment, the burning gourd on the head, the soul ring on the Dae-feng, a ring of gold red like a substantive burning ball burst out, straight to Tang Mai Rin chest.
That's Battle!
Fight against each other!
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
And then there's a strong backlash.
Tang is stronger, with the help of Jin, hand armor fighting armor, at most is equivalent to the four ring soul level stronger, and before the opponent, is the real one word fighting armor!
On the right hand, trying to throw away the opponent, On the strength side, Tang Mai Lin is quite confident of himself, Meanwhile, a blue silver grass drilled from underneath him, on the ground, hard to change his direction, trying to avoid the Phoenix and the fireball.
But both attacks are able to change direction, and follow up with the change of his form.
Just then, a ice spear came silently, just hit on that fire Phoenix was instantly exploded, powerful explosive force directly pushed Tang Mai Lin to fly out.
Even with the backing of the bloody bean sandwich, Tang Lin only felt the five burnt down this, a line of swords crossed the net, stopped chasing his gold red fireball, the fireball burst again, and the sigh of Ying Zhang came with it.
On the practical experience, on the fighting skill, they will not be weaker than D. Feng, but the problem is that the level of soul power is too weak.
With one word of armor, in defense, it is Tang Lin they now hard to defeat.
Sha appeared silently behind Deng, his light dragon dagger, shadow dragon dagger, tied on De Dengng's shoulders.
Co D'Fong's full armor was just a flash of light, and in the next instant, a layer of red light had already burst out, and shot him directly.
I can't break. how can I do this?
D has quickly taken control of the whole.
At this moment, the threat came suddenly, and in her sight, without any warning, there was more than one light bulb, and the light bulb was very splendid, and presented to four colors, blue, red, yellow, blue.
Dae-feng did not dare, the fourth soul ring light up, on the top of the fire gourd suddenly rose a few minutes, and then a series of golden red fire balls sprayed out.
These golden balls, like bullets, instantly blocked the path of the four-coloured ball, with the burning sound of a fierce elemental storm in the air.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
He's strong and he's not injured. But this war really can't be fought!
The fact proves that the defense of a word of armor is absolutely forbidden to test, the elemental storm overwhelmed the feet and feet for five or six seconds, it is not easy to stop gradually, Deng Feng still stands there, the strands under the feet are not moving.
The red flame flickered, not even half dark, and above the head, the fire hose had once again matched the Tang Mai.
Sister,I think,I think it's a mistake.
Tang said with a sad smile.
At this moment, a loud alarm sounded, not far, three shadows were flying toward this side.
There were three armours, but unlike in the Battle of Heaven, these three armours were all yellow, and there were no purple armours.
Hold your hands!
Theming, who was preparing to go, had to stop his hand, the mouth of the fire rose up, hummed cold, looked at the angry eyes of the Tang.
Then she was surprised to find that had earlier attacked his little boy, and at this time the face was filled with sadness.
The three armours descended from the sky, the yellow armours up to ten meters tall, and at a glance separated the two.
"Wow!" "Wow!" "Wow!" "Wow!" "Wow!" "Wow!" "Wow!" "Wow!" "Wow!"
Sha fell down, full of loneliness, leaves shivered a bit, Xuass sat on the ground, the face of the old moon, only a glimmer of laughter under the eyes.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
"You're here, law enforcement," he said.
If you come late, we will be burned to death.
"What?"Demfeng did not respond for a moment, and it was obvious that they had done it first!
The electronic sounded from the deck, "What is the matter?
Why are you doing this to these boys?
Du is just registered in the tower, the law enforcement do not know her.
But when it comes to a few words of fighting armor, obviously full of vigilance.
Though they had three armours, only yellow armours and their repairs, could never be an enemy of a one-word archer.
"Don't listen to their wicked first," said Deng, angry.
"What are you talking about? What are we going to do to you? You're a fighter! We're just a few fighter spirits, law enforcement uncle, I'm 14 this year, and my friends are 13 years old.
Do you think we can do it with a one-word archer?
Deming, who was about to die, said with a shaky body, "Your bloody mouth makes clear that you were the first to do it to me, and at that time you did not know that I was a warrior.
We don't know at all.
Tang said without hesitation, "We don't know why we are doing this to you.
I hear you're just becoming a warrior, want to find someone to try.
Then when you saw us, suddenly a clapping to me, we just had to defend.
My teacher taught us that the greater the greater the responsibility, but you are the one who fights the armor, but you overwhelm.
Are you trying to turn black and white?
The crying more loudly, all of them are hanging on the leaves.
Don't go overhead.
A long sigh.
He has been with Tang for a long time, and his acting has also made significant progress.
Each of the two words, and the law enforcement is a bit surprised, but there is no doubt, the three law enforcement under the consciousness of all tends to the Tang Mai Lin party.
That's the advantage of the young, it doesn't seem like they're going to dare to challenge a one-word archer.
"You all go back to the tower, get the surveillance video, and then decide what is wrong," said the chief of the law enforcement.
Good!
Tang Rin did not hesitate to give one.
Deng's way of biting teeth:
"You little bitch, when the evidence is before you, I see how you still refer to deer as horses."
She's really angry!
The Three Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn Turn
Please take up your armour.
It's to prevent her from suddenly escaping!
Deng wasted his temper and said, Are your eyes blind? Are there any differences?
Three Lights on the deck at once, three soul guide guns have already reached her.
"You see, uncle of the law enforcement.
That's what she's all about.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!

CHAPTER 439 The Brace of a Brace
All of them were trained, and in the face of the mighty, they used the most steady method, and the three shots were not aimed at Deng Feng, but at the air.
Three Cannons collided with each other, and suddenly a strong energy storm erupted.
Dengfeng, despite his armor, was distorted by the strong energy impact.
The three guns rapidly burst out of the air, and the three soul guns burst out madly into her at the expense of her energy.
Faced with a word of armor, who dare to have half a reservation! And the just-in-head of the law enforcement has called for support, they just support for a little time.
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
The three armours were very quiet, the soul lead gun exploded madly, forming a cross-fire, seamless cover.
Even though Deng Feng is strong, her main fighting power is still on the Wu Feng, a word fighting armor has just been trained, the combination of Wu Feng and fighting armor is not perfect, at one time actually suppressed.
This is a good opportunity for Tang to let go He is not Tang Tang.
He ran with his companions and shouted in his mouth, "Be careful, not to be blown.
Let's go.
Come on, uncle of the law!
She was the fastest, like a plume of smoke, and immediately jumped onto the soul guide car parked not far away, and the others jumped onto the car, and even Xu Kasa was wise at this time.
At the end of one foot of oil, the soul car emitted an audible burst, instantly accelerated to run.
At this moment, all the attention of the three law enforcement officers was on Deng Feng, the sound of the soul guide gun far more than the sound of the car launch, they did not find at all that the six Tang Mai ran, and on Deng Feng's side was the energy light, nor did they find at all.
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu
"It's too bad for us," he said.
Isn't it a very few armored soldiers? Why did we choose one?
Tang said with a grin, "It looks like we're going to have a different way, which is too uncertain, and also too guilty.
It's not a good idea! If we go on like this, we're probably going to be the most unwelcome people in the tower.
"No," said old Moon, "I have."
"You're getting better and better," he said.
"You think I do," said Tang. "I don't think you can do anything with the power of the archer.
If we didn't say so, once we were caught in the tower, we would have delayed a lot of time even if we could finally figure out a way to get out.
Think of another way to apologize.
"Pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
Those little bastards are just liars. Are they attacking me?
Looking at the displayed on the monitor, several law enforcement have not spoken.
It was not easy before Deng fought out of the three armored encirclements, and found Tang Lin they were gone, angry to go after, and then the reinforcement of the law enforcement had come, directly came three purple armored encirclements.
Although he was strong, in the face of six machine guns, Deng Feng had no way.
She was able to surround herself, but then, she got this thing today! So, she chose to go directly, and was brought back to see the video.
"I'm sorry, Miss Deming, but your identity is also clear to us.
It was a real shame before, and we didn't think these children were so cunning at a young age.
"What are you waiting for? " "I'm not going to catch them."
"I'm afraid that won't happen," said one of the first middle-aged law enforcement.
We're not a coalition law enforcement agency, though we're super-ranked, and it's easy to get to the bottom of the federal government if we send lots of people to search for them.
We're going to be very bad.
We have informed the government and can only go after them.
Besides, to be honest, we have limited evidence of this, and most importantly, you have not suffered any damage.
Even if they were brought back, there would be no punishment for them, even if they were an act of provocation and were kept for a few days by the law enforcement.
It's only now that's cool. Yeah! I don't hurt myself too much, it's not a good thing to judge.
They say they must be thirteen or fourteen, and under 18, they are protected by the law on minors, and I'm afraid it's difficult to catch them, and ultimately it's asking parents to pay a fine and bring them back to stricter education.
Those little things are so bad!
"Miss Deming," you said.
We apologize to you for this.
Several law enforcement officers stood up at the same time and bowed slightly to her.
Demphan looked at them, and wasted most of his spirit, and put his hands together, and said, count it.
Don't let me meet them again.
There's nothing I'm gone.
Law Enforcers have always sent her tower, as armored, and joined the armored armored to the heavenly tower, Law Enforcementrs still very respect her, say one day, this will be their top boss!
Out of the Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th
At this moment, her eyes suddenly stopped, and fell in one direction, and there was a man who looked as old as himself, with a long, white robe, and a long hair spread over his head.
Their whole body washed out.
D is a fire characteristic, her temper is also related to this aspect.
When she saw the man, she suddenly found that the fire in her heart was lowered.
That's pretty!
She swallowed a spit inadvertently. No girl likes a handsome man.
Besides, just a glance, Diệm surprised to discover that he did not see through the man's training, but to be sure, must be the spirit.
The Soul Master?
It looks like ice.
As a fire spirit, her feelings about the ice are most obvious.
He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He, He
At first she had some uncertainty, but soon she found that man was walking straight toward her, not fast, but very steady.
His eyes looked at her.
Good eyes! Good looks!
From the other's eyes, D Feng soon saw his shadow, but suddenly discovered, his image seems not good.
My clothes and my hair were a little messed up before I did it.
A little panicked, and though she felt she had done it as without any mark as possible, there were some burns on her face.
Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello
Deng Feng's heart suddenly jumped, and the voice so moving, though cold, but drilling heart!
Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey!
"I call it dance.
The white man nodded to her.
Oh, my name is D.
She unconsciously announced her name.
"I'm really sorry.
Those kids today are my disciples.
They are taking a test, which is the final exam of the college, so they will be looking around for people to consult, without malice.
I apologize to you instead.
Therm, and therm, and therm.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Deming's heart beat faster, but in the next moment, her heart beat stopped suddenly, her eyes shrinked suddenly, and her voice rose eight degrees, "What are you saying? Those, those... are your disciples?
"Yes," he said.
D'Fong's breathing became urgent, "They came to me in a strange way, and that's what you taught?
It's still so cold.But I'm their teacher.You can't take responsibility for me either.
"You..."
Demphin suddenly finds out that he can't say anything angry.
The Dancer pointed at her again, "I apologize again, goodbye."
He turned and went.
"Hello!" cried Deng Feng.
The dancer paused and returned, What else?
"An apology is over!"
"What do you think?"
CHAPTER Fourty-One Please Me
"Be honest about apologizing and at least ask me for a meal. "
When she said this, she blushed for herself.
However, she has been more than twenty years this year, has been trying to refine, and has not yet had a boyfriend.
She used to think that was the only thing in the novel, but today she didn't fight to find out, although it was the first time she met, but she just liked this seemingly cold guy, too handsome!
"All right.
The dancer nodded,What to eat?
D said in a hurry.
You decide.
There was a glimmer of thought in the eyes of the dancer, and a moment later he said, Come with me.
When he had finished, he turned and went down the stairs.
The back is also so handsome, super handsome!Dem Feng quietly taps on his chest.
Suddenly she felt like the little guys before weren't so bad. Who made them have such a handsome teacher?
Forgive them!
That's the reason!
Themmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
The shadow became clearer in her heart.
He was indeed remarkable, and almost every woman, of all ages, had her eyes strayed from him unconsciously.
D is a five ring king, the sound good, like "Good-looking!
Of course, she herself said the most times.
Because she keeps following him, keeps looking at him!
Turned into a lane and stopped in front of a small restaurant.
The restaurant's door was less than four meters wide, and you could see from the window that there were only four tables.
As long as the dancing stood in front of the small restaurant, where in the eyes with thought, with confusion, from the side, D'emfeng saw clearly, his cold eyes seemed to become soft a few.
"Oh, long, you are here! Come in!"
Out came a man who looked fifty years old and had a short hair.
Apparently he knew the dance, and was very familiar with it, and took a hold of his shoulder, and let in.
If they saw this scene, they would have been surprised to have their lower jaw dropped.
The man who was so clean as to be angry at nothing because of the other man's hand, but gently pointed to the man, and went in.
D Hun followed him into the small restaurant.
The restaurant is very small, the sanitary condition is the same, is the standard fly.
If another man brought her to this place, she would instantly give the other person a zero, which is too close.
But instead of the place where she came from, then, her evaluation is, personality! handsome is different.
Yes, this world is so unfair!
"I haven't seen you for a long time.
Isn't it good?The fat boss took him to a table next to his bed.
It's a good ride. It's good.
Is this your friend?
That's what the fat boss found.
D feng is not beautiful, but there are few charms, itself is the best young age, full of energy.
"Hello."
D Hun laughed at the fat boss, and sat down in front of the long dance.
The fat boss opened his mouth, obviously some surprise.
As it is, the dancer pointed at him.
The fat boss came back and laughed, "Well, well, I'll give it to you.
It's great, you're so good, he said, and immediately rushed to the back.
The Fat Boss went, the warmth of the long face turned cold again, Deng Feng sitting opposite, this could be very serious from the front look at him.
His eyelashes are so long!
The eyes are nice. The nose is nice, the lips are thin.
If he loved me, I don't know... Oh, what am I thinking!
It's not possible.Demfeng's face red again.
"Do you come here often?"
The cold eyes of the dancer seemed to focus at this moment, looked at her, "I used to come.
"It's hard to say your boss knows you."
"Well.
"Do you normally go to heaven?"
The dance shook the head.
"Where are you?"
"Sleak," answered the dancer.
"How old are you this year?"
The dance for a moment, shook his head, didn't say.
"Well," said D. "I guess, twenty-seven?"
There's nothing to say.
"No! That's 26? That's not 28?
Their Eyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thirty-Demfeng looked at him with astonishment.But you are not, your skin is very good, and if you were not more mature, I would have thought you were twenty.
I'm twenty-and you're six years older than me.
"Well.
"Do you always speak like this?
"Well.
"What's going on with those young men? What are they evaluating?"
"The end of the exam."
"That little boy is not a good thing," said Diệm, "and he doesn't tell me anything, nor does he tell me anything," he said.
That's what you taught me?
"It's not me," he said.
"Who taught him?"
Their mouths were shaken, and their hearts were shaken, and it was the first time that she saw a more normal expression in the dance.
"He's a genius. "He's a little helpless.
As a teacher, as a small tree, you have to make sure that he grows straight, but don't go in the wrong direction.
"No," said therapist. "He's very natural."
Demphan left his mouth,I don't think.
Okay, don't say him, say say you.
Are you teaching at a college?
At this moment, the fat boss comes again, the dish is.
A few small dishes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's pickles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three, One, Two.
D was a little hungry, because excited, didn't eat breakfast.
Don't look at the small shop, but these dishes are full of color and smell, to have a sense of the finger movement.
Come on, don't behave.
She began to eat herself, added a chopstick fish spices to the entrance, soon, her eyes opened.
"It's very good.
I didn't think this small shop could make this delicious, it's more delicious than a big hotel.
It's very good.
As the dance began, he began to eat slowly, lowering his head, and looking at the four dishes before him, his eyes began to be a little depressed.
Cut a piece of strawberries into the entrance, seeming to taste something, and seeming to feel something.
"You haven't told me where you're from.
"Slick.""""""""""""""""
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
She stared at the dancing and raised her voice, "You are the teacher at Slick College?
"What's going on?" she looked at in the air.
There was a change in D'ing's expression, "No, nothing."
CHAPTER 41
So handsome as a school teacher, it's just perfect!
"Sleak College," I said, "it's really nice!
It's a pity, otherwise I wouldn't be able to study with you.
No No No No No No No
I was a student when you were at school.
You can't be my student.
Deming said,Will you talk?Have you hit girls like this?
The dances silently.
D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D
"Two Words."
D feng stared again, thirty-three-year-old two-word archer, good! No wonder he did not see his repair.
"I've just become a warrior, and my warrior has a name, called Feng.
Only one word is used to name a warrior.
What's your name?
To put it mildly, I'm rather depressed, because I'm a flaming gourd. I'm usually called a flaming gourd or a flaming spirit.
I don't always use gourd, so I use my own name.
What are your two words?
"It's ice."
"Look," he said.
Why do you call this?Your spirit is ice, which is why it is called this.
"The sky is part of the name of the warrior, and the ice is the name of my wife.
Don't eat eat.
Name Name Name Name Name Name Name
You should have thought, he is so good, how can not have a woman?
The tremendous sense of loss made her original appetite unbearable.
The next time, the two did not speak, and ate in silence, and danced for a long time. In his mind, it was completely another world.
Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow
Wait for me to learn and do it at home for you to eat.
"Hey, give me some tofu! It's like saying, more tofu is good for the skin.
My skin is a little better than yours, but I still have to work.
"I'm eating meat, and I want to eat half a bowl of meat," he said. "Do you think I am fat?"
"Look at you idiot, you've got corn on your face.
I'm not gonna kiss you. Oh, don't touch me!
Out of the little restaurant, already in the middle of the day.
D Feng smiled at the dance.
"Thank you for lunch."
Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak
"Can you leave a ghost communication number? I'll go to the ghost to get them to cancel the message from the government to your disciples today.
Wait for me to tell you.
The dancer hesitated for a long time, but said a number.
"I'll go to Slick College," said Deng Feng, smiling.
The dance looked at her, I go, see you.
When he had finished, he turned away.
As long as the shadow of him disappeared, Deng Feng took his eyes back, sigh, "All good men have masters.
I'll never find such a good man! Looks like the City of Heaven is too closed, and I'll go to the City of Sleek, and I'm also a warrior.
There's always a chance to find development.
Let me pass the tower.
The Soul Carry on the highway, straight down to a city.
Tianling City was a failure, they had to change the route, to go another city.
Everyone thought for half a day, and couldn't have thought of a quicker way to get the ghosts to work, and to get the law enforcement to trouble.
So, go the old way.
It's not going to get worse, it's going to get better.
In the following cities, they did not hit the iron board again, and successfully completed the examination task.
Their role as monitors was very successful, and they passed through several cities, and soon their tasks were half completed.
"It's day.
Let's accelerate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Over there, you don't even need to find the spirit tower, and it's easy to find the strong spirits.
After all, it's the Union headquarters.
Tangling looked at the map and spoke to his companions.
Walking and Stopping, from the initial tension, gradually to the now relaxing, reading a thousand volumes, walking a thousand miles, it really is meaningful.
They also encountered problems in the course of completing the examination task.
The most troubled them was when they were faced with Deng Feng. But that war also made them fully aware of how powerful the archers were.
As a student of the Slick Academy, in the case of a six-to-one, not to say a five-to-one, even a six-to-one Emperor has no chance of winning.
But when one starts, there is no way, even defence can not be done.
"I know a place for us to finish the final exam," said Ying.
"Oh, where?" asked Tang with curiosity.
"There was once a college that was a big competitor to our Slick College a thousand years ago, and to this day they are still one of the top students in the whole continent, although they can't be compared to our Slick College, but the Union is the leading big college.
Let's go play at the gate.
As soon as she heard of it, the old moon immediately responded, You are saying, The Royal College of the Soul of the Sun, and it is a great college that has been passed down for more than a thousand years.
"Yes."
"I've heard about the pity between there and our college.
I think it would be best if we were able to finish the final exam there.
Tang Lin's eyes bright, "It's right, I think it is.
That's it.
Leung tightened his fist.
"Don't say this," said the man. "You'll have to deal with the problem before you say it."
All looked forward through the windshield, all of a sudden were shocked.
Outside, more than twenty armored vehicles, five purple armored vehicles, fifteen yellow armored vehicles, crossed the highway.
There were no stopping soul cars on the road, apparently they had just fallen.
You can see from the signs on the chests of these aircraft, they come from the tower.
After completing five exams, they were finally brought to the door by the spirit tower.
"What do you do," said She, stepping on the brake to slow down, and hurriedly asked Tang.
Tang Lin's big eyes squinted, familiar with him knew that every time he appeared this expression is a sign of explosion!
"Stop!" Tang said with a big drink, his left elbow beating out with force, "Bang," the whole door flipped out.
As soon as he grabbed the top of the car, the people had turned out.
His actions had told his companions what to do, and he would never be caught.
Even if they were caught, there wouldn't be much of a problem, except to pay for it, to apologize, but there's a possibility that they'll be sent back to Slick College!
Never before in the history of the School of Sleek had the director been eliminated, Don Ballin would never want to be the first, nor would he want to be eliminated together with his partners.
Sheet stamped on the brake, and at the same time hit the steering wheel, the soul guide car suddenly crashed into the next belt.
Everyone is a powerful soul teacher, even Xu Kasa has a protective body, when the car crashes into the boundary, they have been all scattered, all drilled out.
The Old Moon holds a small word, a big drink, " storm snow.
Wu was already excited when she jumped out of the car, at which time the third soul ring flashed, under the support of the tides of the ancient moon, the storm of snow suddenly spread out from the center of her body.On both sides of the highway were trees and fields, Tang Bailin cried out, "Go into the trees, fast!" He drank to his companions, but he did not go.
On the other side, the guides found themselves suddenly turning, and had been lifted up, and a guided gun approached them, flying at speed.
CHAPTER 42
Their flight, though accelerated, was very fast, and was never comparable to their present speed. Only the drilling forest had such a chance.
And there's one thing that's that the machine guns belong to the Tower, not the official.
It is not easy to kill, it is not to break the order of the Federation.
So Tang decided that the purpose of the machine guns was to catch them, not to kill them.
It was this judgement that gave him some confidence in taking his companions away.
Indeed, the armor that flew into the air took back the soul-guided guns in their hands, and the red-handed guns flew toward them, flying in the forefront, the five purple armors, which were as fast as the wind-swinging switches.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
Their right arm suddenly expanded, and their armor appeared.
He instantly elevated himself to the strongest combat.
The Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long
He injected all of his soul power through his hands into his right-the claws of the dragon, to catalyze the claws of the dragon.
Before the final examination, he did not dare to do so, because the right hand of the King Dragon claws would feel unbearable, but accompanied by this out after the blood continuing to rise, although not able to break the King King the fourth seal, but the physical endurance is clearly increased.
Five Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo Glo
It was only five feet long when it was just waving, but it was caught up in the storm. It instantly turned into a giant claw of tens of meters, which, as it grew, became fictitious, but it had just stopped the five purple armored vehicles from leaving.
The Five Purple Machine guns face this scene as well as a leap, the Soul Master's attack range and their own strength is proportional.
The Golden Rings of Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang

Carrying the core force of the Dragon Claws, the protective cover has been filled with cracks, but it is dangerous to break.
This scene from a distance is absolutely shocking.
In front of twenty armour, that little shadow lifted up, one claw out, five purple armour swept and flew, what kind of heaviness side leak!
Fifteen yellow armored cars followed, but when they looked at five purple armored cars being bombed by Tang, they suddenly stopped and did not dare to jump directly.
The power of the purple armor is likely to tear their armor!
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
A soft hand quickly grabbed his hand, flying.
Storm Snow, released by the combined powers of the moon and the moon, however, exceeded the rings of the rings of the rings of the rings, which had already covered hundreds in the air in the air in the air, which had covered hundreds in the air in the air, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which were above the rings of the rings of the rings, but above the rings of the rings of the
Tang's just shot not only stopped their chase, but also played a pretty strong deterrence.
Neither of those purple-class armed men were able to withdraw completely in the face of one another.
So they weren't afraid to disperse the search, only to gather together and search through the armored radar.
But the way to deal with machine guns, which the school of Sleek had already talked about shortly before the beginning of the school, the energy fluctuations in the snow storm, and the radar wants to play a sufficient role in it is almost impossible.
Tang Lin was dragged forward, suddenly, foot next to the sky, body to the bottom, when he was in the mind of surprise, already on the ground, then felt black in the sight, the light suddenly disappeared.
Immediately afterwards, a ring of golden lights lit up, and he saw the situation.
It's a small space, surrounded by mud, all the partners are here, pulling their own hand is the old moon.
The gold glow in her hand.
She let go of Tang's hand, and without speaking, her eyes brightened, and the elements of tide and control of the two great spirits were released simultaneously, and suddenly Tang Tang sensed that the ground beneath her feet was slowly sinking, and more strangely, that the mud above had closed itself, as if continuing to swallow them down.
The other companions, looking at the old moon, were astonished by the heavens, even the arrogance of the leaves, at this time in the eyes of the divine glory.
The earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth
They're naturally safe.
There was no way, there was no way to enter, and the old moon opened the gate for them, and the armored men of the tower could not dream, and they could escape, and they could not be any way to seek, unless they had carried out a carpet-bombing for the first time, but they were no evil, and nothing to do not, and nothing to be no evil, and nothing to be no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no evil, no e

"Take control of your breath," said Tang to his companions.
But don't run away from the hunt and get drowned underneath.
"It's all right," said old Moon.
As soon as she threw her left hand, a ball had been suspended in the midst of the sky, and her right hand rubbed gently on the ball, suddenly the ball began to become smaller, and the air in the underground space became much more comfortable.
"The teacher taught me how to separate the elements of water so that we could produce the oxygen we need.
"Sister Moon," I said, "you're all right!"
Ha.
Old Moon smiled,,Don't say these,they should not have found us.
We'll go later.
But what's next?
We're being picked up by the Towers, and we're expecting all of the city's tower to be alerted, and we're not going to be the way we were before.
"The next few cities we are going to, are big cities.
There must be a spiritual college in a big city where there will be no shortage of more than our spirituals.
We can do this.
His ideas were originally conceived by proposing the Royal Academy of the Soul.
There's no way tower, that's all.
After an hour, the old moon controlled the soil and pushed them back to the ground.
But what made them sad was that the car crashed and could not be driven.
Tang had seen the map before, from their location to the next city, less than two hundred kilometers, there is no other way, just one word, run!
Thermal Elements of the Ancient Moon, plus Xu's intelligence of light spirits.
Tang Lin with some Xu's wisdom, with the help of Xiao, the six can only rely on their own legs, stretching the small road near the highway to the next city.
CHAPTER Fourty-three!
Two Hundred kilometers is nothing for a super strong person like Tang, but Xu has been more miserable, even with the support of the recovery of the big meat bag plus the lightning small cage bag, two Hundred kilometers down, he himself feels a thin circle.
"The tower" ""The tower" ""The tower" ""The tower!"
"What do you want?" asked the old moon.
Xu looked at her,I will never sell the bags to them later!
Look at your breath.
"Today's plan was to have two cities, but now it looks like there's only one.
Let's take a break first. Then let's go to school in the afternoon.
They found a small hotel and they were all souls, and they recovered quickly.
Tang Rin Shun listened to the soul instructor college.
Their hometown, called Tian, was about two thousand kilometers away from Ming and would pass through several other cities. There were no cars and they had no money to buy any more.
There's a spirit instructor college in the city of Tian, and after listening to Tang, he discovered that there's a very famous spirit spirit instructor college, called the Tian Tian Star Academy, which is a special spirit instructor college, which only invites spirits who have flying spirits.
There is also a high school, which trains high-ranking souls, armor masters, and armor masters.
It's not necessary to be so serious about the training of archers.
The general graduation age is from twenty two to twenty five, and even in Slick College, there are very few students who can complete a word of combat within this age, let alone other colleges.
'That's him,' said Tang, the resting of his companions, and he was not tired, and he picked up a telecommunications device in the hotel, and dialed a number.
"Teacher," said Tang in a respectful voice.
"What about the final examination? Is it going well?"
"It's not going so well," said Don. "It's going to be a little bit of trouble.
Now that I am in Tianding, because there is no forger's badge, I can't take on the forger's assignment, see if you can say hello to the forger's association here, let me take on the forger's or the forger's assignment, and let me borrow a forger's hammer for use.

There was a little silence, "You are really miserable.
You go ahead and don't forge anything. Your forging level plus your age can easily cause some unnecessary trouble.
I'll give you some money and you'll spend it.
"Well, thank you," said the master. "Look at the master's atmosphere.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
"You don't have to thank yourself," he laughed. "Whenever you're free, come and play here at the headquarters."
"I'll go."
Tang said without hesitation, not to mention how much the master had pointed out for his future forging ascension, but the master's good food made him want it and not!
After running through the Forwards' Association, as the afternoon's companions came to rest, Tang had returned from the Forwards' Association, and had brought back a million federal dollars.
"Get another car," she said.
"What do you see?" said Tang, looking at his friends.
"It's really convenient to have a car, but it's at least more convenient inside the city, and with the navigation system, we can save a lot of time."
Then buy!
I paid as much as I did last time and bought a car of the same size.
Based on the addressed by Tang, the people immediately went to the Heavenly and Heavenly Soul Instructors College.
Located at the southwest corner of the City of Tending, the College has been established to this day for nearly two thousand years, even though it is far less old than the Slick College, which has been in existence since ancient times, it is also considered to have a long history.

Though they can fly with their soul guides, they themselves can fly, and they are much better at controlling the air war than ordinary soul guides.
Even though the Wu is not very strong, fighting power can be enhanced by the soul guide, the appearance of the soul guide, greatly close the gap between the ordinary soul guide and the genius soul guide.
With the advent of machine guns, the souls themselves are weak for a long time, not even able to determine the battle victory.
It was not until the later appearance of the battle armor that the strong spirits regained their superiority.
The Planetary Academy is a college focused on the training of the soul, the flight soul.
Their armored divisions, therefore, are well known in the Federation and are the rare talents in the major military areas.
With the support of the military, the Academy of Astronomy is developing very rapidly. In addition to the long-standing top academy, they are also ranked among the two-line academy.
An Ordinary Soul Driving Car stopped in a small alley not far from the Sky Soul Driving College.
Six people on the car, all wearing green sports.
Green is always a very bright color.
It's Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
The Astronomy Academy front door is very showy, made of metal, up to 20 meters outside, 40 meters wide, even the armor can easily pass through the large door.
Their walls are large, and their area is quite uncommon.
A large area southwest of the city belongs to them.

She had a touch of the mouth, and brought out the same thing, which was a width of two long bamboo poles.
It's broad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,...
He and Xu, on one side, pulled up the side, and put the bamboo rod on the ground.
There was a lot of excitement at the entrance to the Academy of Astronomy, and as soon as they pulled up, they caught the attention of many people.
"We're from Slick College, and we're going to challenge the best teams under the age of 20."
This is the front door?
Yes, that's the way Tang Tang thought, simple, rough, direct, time-saving.
There was a guard at the gate of the Academy of Astronomy. It was a little before that, and the students had just begun to enter the school. Many had seen the scene, and had subconsciously stopped and stared, some surprised, some frowned, some angry, some curious.
Soon there were people in front of the school.The school that attracted them most was undoubtedly the school of three words.
For any student,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Challenge the strongest team under the age of twenty? Look at their age.
Standing at the front with no expression, he believed that simple, direct challenge, the Academy of Astronomy could not be rejected at all, if it were rejected, the reputation of the Academy would have fallen a thousand, and the psychological shock of the students would have been no doubt great.
"Are you really at Slick?" asked a young man, who looked seventeen or eight years old, quietly in front of Don.
"Hello," said Don, "we're from Slick, and we want to have a game with your college.
"How do you prove that you are from Slick?" said the youth.
Tang Lin smiled, in his eyes a flash of gold, a circle of gold rose suddenly from under his feet.
The gold washed away, and suddenly aroused a stir.
Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold Gold
Where do they know that's not a normal ring, it's a bloody ring.
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
The reason for not releasing three purple soul rings is because the golden soul rings to the person feel more shock, first calm the other say.
The young man, too, turned his back two steps.
Chapter Fourty-four The Academy of Astronomy
At this moment, the door of the Academy of Astronomy opened, and a few people came out.
It looks more than forty years old, the first one tall, some white short hair stands up, looks very spiritual.
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
"Sleak College? Are you an outside or an inside?" asked the middle-aged man.
Don said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
The formal challenge is different than finding cheap in the Forge.
"The boss?"
The middle man's surprise was evidently stronger than when he first saw the golden ring on him.
Take your sides, please.
said the middleman.
With a wave of the Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
Don't always play outside the door.
Go to school. Don't be around.
The mid-age man, who was evidently of great stature in the academy, the students of the Academy of Astrophysics all of a sudden became birds and beasts, and each went into the academy.

"I'm the director of the Taoist College, Li.
Our College has a long history and is one of the most prestigious Higher Soul Colleges in Tianjin City, with a focus on teaching Flying Soul Masters and Soul Instructors and Machine Gun Masters.
There are also specialized post-graduate colleges to train fighters.
You're here on behalf of Slick College?
When he heard the words of the Slick College, Tang's heart suddenly moved, and he said the truth: "We are not here to represent the College, to be honest, Director Lee, we are here to represent ourselves.
This is a training of the college. It asks us to look for power over our opponents fight in the cities.
We can't make it here,please forgive us.
But to choose the Temple is because we know that this is the best college in the city, even in the northwest.
When did he become so real?
But they were still behind, listening to Tang Lin, the director of Li Zhong laughed, "It's true that the first calf is not afraid of the tiger, it's a little monster that we've grown at Slick College.
You didn't knock on the door. You've left us a face.
I remember that year, there was a director who, for the purposes of the college, went alone to the army stations, and the chaos overwhelmed.
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
Tang said with a look of surprise, "You've also studied at Slick before?"
Li laughed,Yeah,I'm probably fifteen years older than you.
It's a pity, but it's hard to graduate from college.
Although he said that was, the look of his face was more than that of pride.
To be able to graduate from Slick College is the best thing in his life.
Tang Lin laughed, Then we should have called you a teacher.
Good Teacher.
I'm really sorry this time. If it's not convenient, let's go and think of another way to finish the final exam.
Li Zhong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And you're at the door of the college, And if there's no result, I can't tell the students.
I'm looking for the strongest team under the age of 20, and I want to see how far our students and you can go.
When I was in college, my greatest hope was that one day I would be able to study on Lake Hyde and enter the inner school.
It's a pity that didn't happen in the end.
His eyes were filled with sadness, seemed to be filled with memories, Tang Lin also smiled.
He's telling the truth because he's watching.
When he first saw Li Zhong, the director appeared to be very powerful, but looked in their eyes was evident to be a little closer, plus later in the conversation Li Zhong's eyes change and raise the expression of Slick, Tang Bai Lin had already guessed something, so he said the truth, indeed, moved the director.
Thermal Academy's main teaching building is spectacular, up to nearly a hundred meters, and from outside it can't be seen as being divided into several floors. It's a huge dome. It's not much different from the Slick Academy's main teaching building, but it's much smaller.
Li first took them to a restroom, then asked: "It's only to consult with the spirits, are you using machine guns?"
Tang Rin hurriedly shook his head and said, No, you see us like this, can the college bring us out with the armor?
All right, take a rest, drink some water, and I'll arrange for it.
"When did you become so honest?"
"He must have noticed something," said Ko, "that director Li has a relationship with our college, so he's telling the truth.
She didn't get it at first, but later, listening to their exchanges, she began to get a taste of it.
Tang Lin smiled without saying anything, just raised his fingers on his head.
" Cut... """"""""""""""
"Let's get ready," said Tang. "I don't think it's going to be easy.
Despite the fact that director Lee was our president and supported our final exams, he is now representing the Academy of Astronomy, and will surely choose the best students to compete with us.
Their spirits here are very good at flying and it's going to be a lot of trouble. All this is done according to the plan we've negotiated.
Everyone nodded.
Their Eyes.
It won't be long before Li returns.
"Do you need some adjustment?" he asked as soon as he entered.
"I don't want to," he said.
We'll have to go to the next city and finish the fight before we can finish the exam.
Li smiled: As a teacher, are you afraid of being eliminated from the team?
Don Rin shook his head and said: "I'm not afraid of that, but I hope I can get more points and then give them to the students.
I hope every student in our class can finally stay.
"Well," said Li, "you're a good teacher.
Now come with me.
To their surprise, there was no elevator inside such a large teaching building, completely turned up stairs.
Lilong explains that is for the timeless exercise of the students' physical quality.
Along the stairs to the top, the top of the stairs, the top of the stairs, the top of the stairs, more than thirty meters, is a huge dome building.
Walk through a corridor into a large hall.
The hall was big, and more surprisingly, it was an open-air hall, without a dome, facing the sky.
"This is the Academy's observatory and an important field of practice.
It's about 300 meters in diameter, and it's not restricted to heights, because our college is dominated by flying souls.
"It's a great thing to be able to look at the sky here in the evening," said Tang.
CHAPTER 45
"It's not difficult to see the sky," Li smiled.
There's something strange about our viewing.
Whether day or night, once launched, can draw closer to the distance between us and space, can directly see closer to the sky.
Their large soul guide array, thus attracting the star force into the observatory, provides the purest energy, helping our students to practice. Only exceptional students are allowed to practice here at a particular time.
Most of the graduate students are here. through the star power quench themselves quench themselves fight.
This was a real surprise, I didn't realize that there was such a special place.
Looks like this game is not very good! But wait, star power? star light?
He turned his unconscious head and looked at the little word that was not far from him, but when he saw it, his eyes were filled with confusion.
"Wait here and feel the environment.
Our trainees will come soon.
Around the observatory there is a wall of up to 30 meters, and if you look closely you will see that there is a lot of thickness and patterns on the walls made of rare metals.
Listening to Li's previous introduction, plus observation and feeling, it can be found that this observatory contains huge potential energy.
Soul Guides have been used by people for many years, but for thousands of years, mankind has never stopped the development of soul guide guides. More and more large and complex soul guide guides are designed and produced.
They have different uses.
Among these, the Army possesses the largest number of soul guides. They are used in defense facilities.
And in front of me this soul guide is the most complex and enormous that Tang has ever seen, I don't know if there's a Slick College, there must be.
After all, Slick is the first college on the continent!
Feeling all around, soon, a group appeared before them.
Their school uniform is black with a star embroidery in front of their chest.
A silver represents amendment, each more than one, which is a more than one level of soul power.
So, measure the strength of the students here, see the number of stars on the body can understand.
At this time the six students dressed all in silver stars shining, four men and two women, as they entered, first glanced at the six Tang Mai Lin, with some curiosity.The six men seemed to be between eighteen and twenty years old.
With a glance at Tang, one can distinguish them from the weak.
One of the strongest had 46 stars, and the other five had more than 40 stars.
Born at Slick College, they don't really care about their superiors.
But Tang Lin cares about this viewing platform, there is no doubt that Li Zhilong let them do a trial here, will never be without a shot.
"I'll introduce you both," Li smiled.
The six are high school students.
And the six of us are the best under graduate students.
All right, let's introduce ourselves.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
In front of a tall young man, on the first step, smiled: "Hi, welcome to the Academy of Astronomy, I'm Captain Shaw every day.
By the way, like you, I'm also a strong attacker on the Souls.
Their eyes collided, both smiling, but looking at each other.
Due to his age, Shaw had a better and longer body every day, but he didn't see any emotions in his eyes.
The Second Open, "The Therm," "The Therm,"
A simple introduction.
The other, a slender male, all looking very ordinary, nothing strange, but the number of silver stars on him is only after the Ancients, 414.
Leaf Book,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
"Thank you," "I'll take you to the battle of souls."
The third, tall, looked the strongest of all six.
"He's ancient warrior," he said.
He's agile? Not a strong one?
"Eyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeye
The Fourth Man of the Academy of Astronomy is a moderate but very handsome young man, smiles, his voice instantly left a profound sound to Tang Lin, and gently listens, "Zhang Xi-Ning, control the system of the ghost.
"Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh," "Oh,
Huang said unconsciously, his eyes still shining with confusion.
The Fifth Man was a girl, looked beautiful, looked pretty, laughed, said: "I'm Li Yao, a strong attacking system soul.
"Mr. Xu," "Mr.
Fat
The last college on this side is also a woman, the appearance is a good choice, looks soft and weak.
"I'm cold," he said, "and I'm the one who controls the soul."
What about the control?
After hearing the other's self-introduction, Tang Lin was in awe.
Captain Shaw is every day a strong attack battalion, then there are two additional control battalions, pure control battalion battalion.
You know, they're only six!
Half are in control. What's the matter?
Furthermore, according to the characteristics of the Astronaut Academy, these six individuals are also Astronauts, in their own particular fields. All of them above forty grades. This battle is definitely not good.
Tang Lin looked at the old moon around, the old moon felt his eyes turned to him, the two eyes opposite, little unheard of each other's heads.
"Well, the teachers who are in charge of controlling the observatory are already in place.
It's awkward," said Li, grinning.
He's always proud of himself as a Slick graduate, but he wants his students to be able to beat Slick graduates!
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
Achieving the victory of this race, although a little different in age, is also the pride of the Academy of Astronomy.
Which school has defeated the school's junior team?
Both sides retreat and distance, this is the rule of the game.
As he retreated, Tang's eyes began to brighten.
Anyone who knows him is a man who, the greater the pressure, the stronger the will to fight, and the more the potential to be stimulated.
The six opponents are strong, but are they stronger than the five boys genius of the year?
Even after defeating the martial arts, Tang is confident, even in certain places, they can also defeat the opponent.
That's Slick's unwavering belief.
They represent not only themselves but also the glory of Slick!
Triangle, Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
The other six people did not put forward the meaning, still a word row.
Six is the test of personal strength, more important is the cooperation between each other.
Ready! Li Zhong was the referee of the game.

It's a nice view.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
The sky began to become dark, all the golden light disappeared in a short time, the walls around were still gorgeous, but the day had become an immense star sky, the starlight seemed to be near.
Extraordinary and pure energy descends from the sky and bathes the entire observatory.
Tang Lin clearly saw, in the face of the six, all appeared, if there were or were no pale golden faintness, his own breath clearly increased, though not obvious, but no doubt, in this environment, there are people added.
"Well?
A whispered from behind.
Tang Lin looked back, suddenly saw a surprise.
A shining golden light rose from behind him, and the golden mist rose, so that all who were close to her could not see her.
"A little."
Tang Rin gave a low call.
CHAPTER IV I am very strange
"I'm fine.
I'm good, I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good!
Li, the judge in charge of the event, was somewhat surprised, as he was most familiar with the observatory, where the trainees were able to absorb the star power and refine their bodies, but only the spirits who could fly the spirits were effective.
It can be said that observatory is the foundation of the Academy of Astronomy.
Fighting here, the soul itself will be added, and the speed of recovery will be much stronger than outside.
But what about that girl at Slick?
She's a spirit?
Different trainees have different levels of perception and absorption of star power, and the more the star power matches, the more the star power fluctuation occurs on the observatory, and the light gold faintness seen before Tang Mai Lin is the same, and even in the Astronomy Academy, only a very small number of trainees can appear the star power simulation situation, usually trainees are not seen on the surface, the light gold fog is the simulation embodiment.
The golden mist that appeared on Shu had become almost substantive, so that even Li, who is familiar here, did not see what had happened to her.
Start!
Along with a big drink, the race started by six students in the first class of Slick College against the best team under the age of 20.
On this side of the Slick Academy, three shadows like lightning flashed out at the same time, at an incredible speed.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
However, it was difficult to see that he was a blue herb, the crystal clear blue vines hidden with gold traces, and if you look carefully, you can see that the surface of the blue herb has a light scale shape.
Their nature is that they meet with the stars, that they meet in a light form, not so violent as the Tang, but the speed is not slow at all.
It's fast, it's kind of hard to see. There are three rings of souls shining, like three arrows, and they're heading straight for their opponent.
The students of the opposite Ascension and Ascension Academy reflected the same, jumping and rising at the same time.
Every day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When he released the spirit, the original length began to expand, and became great.
What's this? Don't realize it at first sight.
Every day around Shaw the most strange leaf book, his hands together in front of him, a yellow light shines, it is a long bamboo, next to the second of the four soul rings shining, bamboo flies gently, countless bamboo leaves flying up, in the back condensed into two wings, hand bamboo rod on the ground, springs up, also flying. His flight seems to fly, the whole person has a strange feeling of lightness.
There was an eagle, a pair of wings open, and there was a lot of hair on the hair, two wings at once, and a fierce blow to the sky.
Battle Eagle!
Zhang was also a pair of wings, but compared with the ancient, his wings were smaller, and more intelligent, the wings were white, a gentle blow, flying up, hiding behind the ancient, like a frightened little bird.
It was Li Yang who was most amazed by Tang.
The next moment when the seemingly delicate woman rose from the air, a strong fire suddenly appeared on her body, and immediately the whole of the man's skin became dark, and the two arms each condensed into a lump of stone, and the flame went out, and the man with her came up, and the six of them flew together, but she was the fastest.
What is this?
It's a great way to open your eyes.
The last winter dress is more normal, she opens behind a pair of colorful butterflies, butterflies lightly beat, lightly floating up.
It's true that's the six!
A hundred meters is only a few breaths for a soul that has more than three circles.
When Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
He didn't just stop.
Ying La and Xi also stopping, jumped up, in the direction of Tang Lian jumped over Tang Lian two arms open, each hug their waist, body in the original dripping dripping around.
It rotated at high speed for three weeks, then it was thrown out, and then it was lifted.
None of them were able to stop people from flying a hundred meters away. They were able to stop people from flying a hundred meters away.
The first to be thrown into the air was Xu, who was fat, and at this time his body curved into a bundle, like a bundle of bullets, and the target pointed to the direction of the opposing sky hawk and the sky hawk and the direction of Zhang Xining, whom he protected.
The Master is always more trouble than the The Master Master Master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master master
Sha is thrown away, the target is butterfly cold clothes, the direction of the leaf stars, is directed to the leader of the other, the strongest肖 every day.
The three flew in three directions, and that was the only way to see how strong the power of Tang was, and how strong the power of control was.
If you look closely, you'll see that all three of them are flying, but they're all wrapped around a blue silver.
At this point, it is the center of the observatory.
Each fireball has a diameter of more than one ft, and with a shiny tail, pressed into the leaf book and Li Yao.
Tang's plan is simple, to stop the opponent at the first time, and to remotely attack the ancient moon and promise on the ground to remotely support, he himself in the middle of the call.
He didn't expect the first time to solve the other completely, but at least to solve part.
Then it's over.
Though flying spirits have a certain advantage over ordinary spirits, the consumption of spirits flying in the air is far greater than that of spirits standing on the ground.
Therefore, Tang Lin is not afraid of the other fly to the extreme height not to fall the situation occurs.
The first to fight was on the side of Xuagashi. He was the first to be thrown out by Tang, with the power of thrust and Tang Tang's powerful arm, absolutely much faster than flying on two wings.
As soon as it reached the specified altitude, a huge ball of meat had already hit the face.
After him Zhang Xining's first soul ring flashed, a bright whistle sounded, his voice really listened, turning leisurely, around the beam endless.
His Warrior Soul is a bird, although it is a flying ghost, but it relies on the sound to control the enemy.
The first skill is to slow down. weaken the opponent.
However, his ability to slow down did not have a direct effect on Xu.
Xu's not flying on his own power! It's been dumped by Tang.
Ancients still wondered, Is this fat not a food system soul? Is it thrown out? Is it a gun?
Being an excellent student of the Academy of Astronomy, his reaction also quickly, the first soul ring on his body, the two wings suddenly forward one beat, dozens of eagle feathers turned into arrows, toward Xu Kasa intelligence shoot.
In Air War, it is very important to be able to attack from a distance, because both sides are easy to get away from.
As the eagle burst, a string of "bobo" sounded.
It's a pity that old man didn't know that he was facing came from Tang.
In the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the midst of the mid
Chapter Forty- Seven
Xu's hands forward, capturing the dragon turned into a controlling crane, dozens of tenacious sharp eagle feathers came out, under his generous soul power, and in the growth of the Tang's darkness technique of the flower, faster than in the past, running straight to the hundred-灵 bird soul teacher Zhang Xining shot away.
But he himself has come to the fore.
Looking at the enormous body before his eyes, Old Heaven has neglected to take care of Zhang Xining, the body of the second soul ring shining, a pair of eagle wings suddenly expanded twice, as much as possible intercept eagle feathers while, joining in.
But what surprised him was that fat man, grinning, put his hand on it, and the body that was about to hit it suddenly stopped in the air, and soon after that, a great cloud of cold light came out of his hand, and these cold lights, like a peacock opening a screen, blossomed outwards, and went round the old sky, straight to Zhang Xining behind him.
That's fat killing, the eagle in front, just a surprise.
Before the eagle struck his body, the fat fell, his smile remained unchanged, still waving to ancient heaven.
Don't!
It's too late for ancient Ming to rescue Zhang Xining.
Most of the eagles were blocked by him, but still some flew before Zhang Xining.
Zhang is a pure control system, or voice control system, his frontal combat ability is infinitely close to zero, but his control ability is the strongest of all.
Faced with the eagle, he could not escape from the wings, but was crossed by several eagles, leaving scars.
Just as he thought he had escaped, the cold light of the big hut appeared before him, which seemed to cover at least hundreds of needles all the way that he could escape, each with a thick soul on it.
There's no!
This is...
There was a sigh in his ear, and then, in a series of "ss" he had come down from heaven.
"Jang Xi-" out of office.
Li Zhong's voice is full of helpless, but he can not save!
Only one faced, in the other's absence of flying ghosts, one of our important control ghosts had already emerged.
School, School of Monsters.
Zhang's face turned red, his heart filled with disbelief, but this is a game, like the battlefield, not disbelief can change the result.
When the fat came down from heaven, and looked to fall into the Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
As soon as the fat lifted his hand, a return of the big meat bag had been handed to him, Tang Liang opened his mouth, swallowed three and two mouths.
At the same time, the lift has also reached the scope of the cold robe, the assault is the most controlled, as soon as it is near, it is almost not possible to turn.
But thermal robes were strangely cool, and her second soul ring flashed, but there was no change in her body, only to see her hands in front of her as if dragged something, and then gently beat the wings behind her.
She had a very different feeling at this time, only to feel that the world in front of her suddenly turned into black and white, and then it seemed that something had broken, the cold robe seemed to be in front of her, his dragon dagger with it, but fell in the sky, everything turned into a bubble, a slight pain on her shoulder, the body began to fall under the sky.
In the eyes of the others, what was seen was the sudden advance attack, the attack was the air, and then the cold robe beat the butterfly, the tip of his shoulder, and flew up in the air.
This is...
Tang Lin's heart, mental control system!
It was not possible for such a deviation to occur, and there was only one possibility, and that was that he was bewitched by the cold robe.
This cold robe is not only a flying spirit, but also a spirit-controlling spirit.
She fell from the sky, and at this moment, a set of flashing lights suddenly burst, not the old moon fireball, but the earlier burst speed of Li Yao.
It was impossible to see the first few soul rings shining on her, only to see her whole body crouched in the air, and then came down from the sky like a meteor, and the aim was, it was, to greet each other, at an incredible speed, and with a strong spirit.
What is this?
A meteor?
Despite being a swift attacker, she fell from the sky, just the time to avoid.
Their defenses are poor.
As soon as he fell on this side, Li Ya to crush ancient moon fire shot, it is clear that she and the cold robe is not a day or two.
As soon as the waist tightened, Xi flew across the body, Tang Tang Lin dragged the silver grass. He dragged the side to fly away from Li Yao shock.
However, Li did not stop the pushing, instead of being tough but down, like the meteor catching the moon, the target is Tang Mai Lin.
Of course they can see that's the core of the six people at Slick.
Force.

The dark red light broke, the swordsman instantly came to Shaw every day.
Shaw was surprised every day, he didn't realize, that Ye was able to launch attacks with the power of starlight, and obviously more fit than himself.
The Third Ring shimmered, and a pair of corners appeared on the top of his head, and a dark red grid burst out from the center of his body, as if the whole man were instantly turning into a giant ball.

But at this moment, she lifted her sword upwards, and the third soul ring flashed.
A strong light rose, her body in a moment repelled the gravity of the earth, and violently turned into a star.
This is...
Li Zhong also looked a bit stuck, he naturally saw, Ye's spirit should also be related to the star, if responsible, she could not so smoothly use the star power.
A little bad anticipation followed.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
It's awful.
Faced with such meteors, Tang Lin raises his right hand, gold scales flow, gold dragon claws appear.
With his claws clawed, the blood of his body went into reverse, and in a moment, he also lifted up a layer of gold.
This is not by the power of starlight, but by the expansion of his own blood to the extent that it is an outward appearance.

For a moment, all the time on the stage seemed to have stopped.
It was so intense that almost drew everyone's attention.
CHAPTER Fourty-eight At this moment, the stars shine
Li Ya's attacks, with a strong reputation, her martial spirit is a strange meteor.
In fact, she is not able to fly, but can use the tail flame ejection ability to climb up to the sky, and then fall down to hit people.
All psychics also use this attack method to increase their own.
With her now four circle strength, her full-time impact power can reach more than 3,000 kg.
And even if one didn't kill the other, she could immediately ascend and attack again, and that was the most terrifying place.
She herself has thermal defense, and the defense is quite strong.
She's the famous killer in this small team, called everywhere on the battlefield. She can even change her direction in the air during the collision.
Their ability to change direction did not work on the Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
A collision so intense that the two of them stayed there. What was the situation?
Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li
At the next moment, his eyes shrinked sharply.
On Li Yang, the center of a Tang Tang claws, appeared some small cracks, and immediately, these cracks spread rapidly, and in the blink of an eye spread to every corner of the meteor.
The next moment, the meteor exploded, Li Yao a scream, the body has softly fallen from within the meteor.
A blue grass wrapped her tightly.
Li's face was pale, and all of his body suffered unspeakable pain from the previous tremors, but the shock in his heart far exceeded the tremors in his body.
How come he's only one hand, and he's blocking my full blow!
Tang Liang dumped his right hand, the whole right arm is a bit acidic, the moment of impact is really not light!
Well, that's all.
Second!

In the light of the star battle, her sword fall really like a meteor catching the moon, at least after Tang Mailing recognized her, it is absolutely the strongest sword fall ever used by Ying Lan.
Star power is really good. Of course, it helps itself.

A black flame washed over his body, and his hands rolled in the air, and a black flow burst out, and became a whirlwind in the air.

In the next moment of Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan Dan
What is it?
Every day the two wings, from the sky, the two wings open, the body in the air flying at the speed of change of form, straight to the moon.
At the same time hands empty, a bunch of dark red light suddenly appeared before Tang, like a black hole, to swallow him in.
Innumerable green lights descended from the sky, and it was a bamboo leaf, which changed and turned in the air, like a path of arrows, covering the whole place, and also concealing the shape of the leaf book.
Hidden in a large piece of bamboo, there are seven pieces of bamboo presented in gold, absorbing the starlight in the air.
His Warrior Soul is called the Seven Star Bamboo, and with each addition of a soul ring, there will be a variety of changes.
Flight is one.
The Seven is his strongest attack, the fourth soul technique.
Soon after the battle began, two of them were out of the game, and six of them at Slick College, although they were not as well trained as they were, were each of them with an extraordinary base of fighting, and they had no chance of going out again.
So, as Shaw started every day, so did he.
On the other hand, the eagle of the battle of the heavens also open the eagle wing, directly to the air of the grace meet.
The Fourth Spirit washed up on her cold robe, and her butterfly wings were doubled in size, in the air in the direction of Tang Mai Lin.The butterfly wings, that is the name of her fourth spirit.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
Where is controlled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He instantly determined that spirit of the cold robe had, I fear, reached the boundary of the spirit sea, and the old moon in the same boundary.
Tang's own spiritual power has not been raised since he was trained to the edge of the spiritual level, the spiritual level is a huge threshold, he has always been trying to train the purple magic eyes, waiting for the time to break.
In his eyes, the latter until he broke through the fourth seal of King Jin, must also be able to break through the sea of spirits.
At this moment, the strong wave of spirit, as the waves normally strike, he had a headache, and Shaw's day-to-day attack was already before him.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
Everyone was covered with a layer of gold.
Their whole body was covered with gold.
Suddenly he himself fell down, his hands on his knees, kneeling together.
Sha's figure in the air suddenly became phantom, his right hand light dragon dagger suddenly thrown out, with a sharp eye blade, straight to the sky fight eagle old sky fly, but his own body in the phantom changed, a feeling of a little over the phantom.
Ancients felt as if the opponent in front of them had suddenly become innumerable, unrecognizable. The wings were shaking, and a large hawk was flying out, but every time the hawk seemed to kill the opponent, it was always drilled from the gap.
In the midst of it came to him.
The S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
She had the dragon dagger against his wing attack, and with the power of the blow, to the sky, to the sky, to the sky, to the sky, to the sky, to the sky, to the sky.
The golden light that was wrapped around Ancient Ancient Ancient Ancient Ancient Ancient Ancient Ancient Ancient Ancient Ancient Ancient Ancient Ancient Ancient Ancient
Their attacks are too fast, and like the magic, they always appear in the places where he is most unable to resist.
Finally, gold wrapped around his wings, thanks to the body over and over, the dragon storm, and then from the air crushed the ancient sun from the sky.
After thermal feathers blow out the butterfly wings to Tang, turn and want to help the ancient, but the ancient has been suppressed, she wants to come to the ancient also a mental attack.
Suddenly, a strong sense of crisis emerged in the brain, and the body rapidly to the next sinking.
An invisible sharp passing by.
Their Clothes were astonished.
'Don't move!' A hand had wrapped her waist from behind, and a cold breath was hanging over her neck.
"You have a strong spirit, and I'm not sure I'll be able to withstand the mental attack you're making on me.
But I'm sure I can't keep up, I can't keep up with your neck, or I can't keep up with the marks on your face.
So let's go down.
The cold robe has never been so close, and under the big red face, what can send out a mental attack? under the mix of anger, can only move the wings slowly down.
Thanks to one's strength, to break the two.
On the other side, Tang Ling body curved, bearing the attack.
The leaves fell, while covering Tang Mai Lin, Ancient Moon, Xu Kasa Chi and far away has not moved, but on the body is spreading strong golden light.
Seven golden leaves hidden in a multitude of leaves each find their target.
The moon was unchanged, centered on her body, and the wind was blowing, and the nearest bamboo leaves could not come near her body.
In the next moment, a flash of silver, she avoided Shaw's day-to-day fights, and appeared beside the little words.
As for Xu, he was by Tang Lin, no need to take care of her.
Just as the old moon was preparing to release her skills to protect her words, suddenly she felt a wave of energy, and as she looked back in surprise, she heard her gentle voice.
Chapter Fourty-nine Star Variations
With the eye-the shining wheel of ice lifted overhead, the next instant, thousands of stars burst out. The strong stars, shining in conjunction with the battle of the Sun, instantly filled the observatory.
All the leaves disappeared instantaneously under the brilliant starlight, only seven golden leaves solidified in the midst of the sky could not move.
Not only the leaves, under the starlight, the sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky sky
The next moment from the sky, become free to land.
Already on the ground, completely lost the ability to act.
For a moment, the whole world seemed to become golden.
Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu
On her forehead, she didn't know when she had more than one flower, just like the star at the top of her ice cube.
Sundays were accompanied by the bright release of her stars, as if the lights had become soft, as if they had found their master.
All the flowers of the gallery were brightened, the stars of the sky were brightened again, and the thousands of stars were gathered to her body in madness.
Tang Lin at this time has stood up again, to see this scene, is also astonishing to close the mouth.
Of course, he did not forget to take the first steps, to hold a golden portrait every day, and to throw out a blue silver grass, to hold a leaf book from heaven.
The Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha Sha
It's like looking up into the sky.
Every one of them can feel that breath is changing, that is the essence of the change.
Shi Shi!
Yes, it is only by a change of spirit that such strong energy fluctuations and immediate changes occur, and, in her present circumstances, in any case, this should be a good change, and a very good one.
Li Zhong wasted, he could not have imagined that would be the case.
In fact, even if the word didn't explode, the result of the game is already destined.
Cho's daily attacks, and the spirit of the feather, could not cause too much damage to Tang.
As for the ability to beat, Tang is absolutely the first of all the players on the field.In the beginning, faced with such a strong attack, he can always carry on hard, not to mention the short face.
Even though the excellent students of the Academy of Astronomy are strong, they have been trained in four cycles.
If Haran is here, with his own power, he can defeat the other team.
It was only a view of the star.
But I didn't expect, but the observatory made a wedding dress to Xu Xiao.
After a flash of light, the light of leaves appeared again in the mid-air.
Bathed under the starlight, she also on the golden light flies, on the sword of the star shining.
It's also absorbing star power.
It's just a small part of what she's absorbed, compared to what she said, and her body slowly descends from the sky.
There's no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.
Their gold gradually faded, restoring their ability to act.
What were they not shocked by the sight of this?
This game doesn't need to go any further. It's destined.
Tang looked at Li Zhong, and walked past, and said in a low voice, Teacher, you see this...
When Li was awake, he asked in his subconscious, "You are a student, and the spirit of war is related to the star power?"
Tang Rin lowered his head.
"I've never seen a ghost so close to star power.
It's really...
He wished she had been in our college.
During his years at the Academy of Astronomy, he had a deep understanding of the observatory.
At this time, the baptism, no matter what causes the change, is sure to bring a great benefit to the small talk.
It is impossible for such a student to be a genius! If it is possible to cultivate such a one, it will be an unparalleled ascension for the entire Academy of Astronomy.
But apparently it's impossible. It's from Slick.
"Sir," said Tang, "can you not interrupt the stars, the little words of the present situation..."
"Of course," said Li, interrupting him, "though she is not a student of our college, this extraordinary circumstance is for her a miracle, and for us an interlude, and we will record and save this information, which will be of great value for the use of star power.
You're all right.
Star power is infinite, so she is absorbed.
Saying this, he turned to the six students at the Academy of Astronomy, and said, "You too have to be aware of the changes in star power and see if you can see something from them.
"Yes," replied one of the six chiefs of the day.
It's just that's not high enough for the six.
As the leader of the younger generation of the Academy of Astronomy, they have always been highly self-esteem.
Three of the six are good at controlling.
They've always been in the competitions in Tian and some nearby cities.
Especially Shaw's magical spirit, is very strong.
But today, faced with a much lower circle than they are generally, and much younger, Slick College, the other one has not yet a flight attendant, they have fallen into a mess.
This is a gap in power. How can we not make them sad?
This wave absorbed, foot and foot for more than an hour, and the body slowly fell onto the ground.
There were many lights on her.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
Sitting on her knees, she watched as the three hundred and sixty-five golden lights appeared on her, and her wheels were straight, and the wheels were completely golden, especially the top of the wheels, and the inside seemed to be vanished, as if they were branded around the stars, and as if they were staring at the sky.
Her spirit must have evolved, at least the stars have evolved. The fluctuations of her spirit did not change much, but for the human sense, it was pure.
It seemed to her that was the effect of the starlight on the whole, and it was a strange thing to say.

Chapter 450 The Royal Academy
"How do you feel?
asked Tang.
Huang said with a frowning, "Wonderful, and I don't know."
Looking at her eyes, Tang had understood, she did not say unclear, but did not want to say here.
"I'm very sorry to disturb you today, sir.
Now that little word has come back, we say goodbye, said Tang to Li Zhong.
"Your sister, what happened to you is very special, and we have recorded the whole process.
We'll study later.
Can you leave a way to communicate more later.
"Well," he said. "Well," he said. "Well," he said. "Well," he said. "Well," he said. "Well," he said.
Of course it's only useful to go back and get the soul guide communications. Now the communications are taken away from the college.
He's out of the Academy of Astronomy. He's in the car.
She was driving to the next city on the map.
"It's a good way to consult with the college," said Tang. "It's really helpful for us to rise.
In the next city, our way is to be more gentle.
"Is our luck going to be so good in the next city? This time we just met the president who graduated from Slick College.
Tang smiled, and took out a paper from his chest.
Before I left, I asked Mr. Lee, which of our colleges would not like to hire people from the School of Sleek to teach? Mr. Lee gave me a list of the cities we were going to go to, including the students from the School of Sleek's graduation, and the ways in which they were contacted.
With these, we can get in advance and then go and talk to people.
"It's the same thing.
"The old moon stared at him.
"Captain, did you think you would do this before? This is a good way to do it.
"What do you mean," said Tang, "you're supposed to be a different kind of warrior.
Hu's expression was a little strange, "It's different, I didn't think there was such a big star power.
At first, I didn't know what had happened, but later I found that those giant star powers came into my body and quickly fused with my psyche, and then my psyche grew as fast as it did, and then it was awakened.
"If my feelings are true, then my original spirit would have been immature or defective.
That's why there's a difference between day and night.
This flaw will be corrected gradually with my upgrading, but it will still exist, and there will be greater impact afterwards.
But this time I absorbed the star power to help me to overcome these defects and also to wash the impurities of my martial spirit.
Let the spirit be more pure.
"So why do I feel that after you have absorbed so much star power, there has been no increase in soul power?"
"Whatever you get," he said, "you're going to lose."
My bravery wasted, but some of it was lost.
My Star Wheel is right now to change the name of the Star.
My ice attributes are washed away by those stars. There are only pure star circles.
"Can it be? That is, you don't have any of the original ice attributes?"
Shu no no no no.
"Are your talents changed after the change of your staff?"
Shu smiled, Of course.
Or is it not to be repaid?
My martial arts have evolved, and my three arts have also evolved.
Let me show you the next match.
Like the captain, I'm in charge of the attack.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
"What about you? You just seem to have absorbed some star power. How do you feel?"
"My spirit and my star power are very intimate, but in themselves are more stable.
So absorbing star power is only soul power.
I'm 40.
Forty!
As soon as this was said, even the previous thank you and Xu Kasa's mind could not resist to return to the head.
"Congratulations," said Xu with a smile. "It's finally 40."
Their Eyes Smile.
Their Fourth Ring will belong to the sphere of the soul.
She was one of the six who entered the 40th level.
With the talent and the power of the star sword, once entered the 40th level, its overall strength will never be as weak as the original lightning.
Don said to She: Don't hurry up the highway, find a place to sell soul guides, we buy a communications.
There is only one function of buying a communications device.
Hello, are you the director of Slick College? We are Slick College...
As Tang said, Slick School is full of pears and sisters to the same school.
Moreover, it is good for these colleges to have excellent students to communicate and consult.
After a few days, they went all the way, every day two exchanges. Finally successfully completed the ninth examination.
Only the last time, can pass this final exam, and at the same time can return to college.
"Isn't there a director at the Royal Spirit College? "Isn't it one of the top universities on the continent?"
"I've heard from the head of one of the colleges that the Royal Spirit College was once destroyed, and it has a direct relationship with our college.
They've been very hostile to our college, so the Royal College is the only one that doesn't want to have Slick students as teachers.
Of course our teachers are not willing to come here to teach.
Even though it is not like ours, there has never been any reduction in hostility to ours.
"Are we going to choose here? "I've heard of the Royal Academy of Souls, and it's said that the elite they train are also pretty tough.
Many of the highest levels of the Federation come from this college.
Would you like to change one?
"What is the purpose of our final examination?The college has taken away all of us, and let us go alone, to take this final examination, which is a trial for us.We not only have to complete the examination, but also get something in the examination.
Don't you have confidence?
Thanks to the eye of the god, to Tang Tang Tang.
Let's try the way:
"I haven't played in the last few games.
"Yes, but it hasn't been done yet."
"It's the last one," he said.
Tang Lin and her glance, the face suddenly appeared a smile.
If you are an enemy, then you can win, not lose.
"You won," he said.
At this moment, there was a cold sound in the car, which appeared very strange, and scared the whole crowd.
"Mr. Dancer," Tang said, "and then he saw the dancing sky outside the window.
It was like walking through empty space, and it was the sound that came from his mouth that was floating alongside their fast-moving cars.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
The dancer looked at him from behind the window and nodded.
"You represent the honor of Sleek. Since you have chosen the Royal Academy of the Soul, you shall not fail.
I'll go with you as a team teacher.
There's a team exchange, that's more formal.
Tang asked, "How many points can that add?"
"Yes," said therapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprap
In other words, each of you can give more than fifty to the others.
"One word," said Tang without hesitation.
If he can get so many points, then his goal will be achieved.
Six more than three hundred, enough to help many students.
"If you lose, all your previous efforts will be lost.
"How hard?" said Tang.
"The resentment of the two colleges is only more serious than you think.
So if you lose, I'll give up the college.
CHAPTER 4 51
It's not just harmful to us, but also harmful to ourselves!
Tang Lin began to regret the choice of the Royal Soul Academy is really wrong, the pressure, but really a bit big!
M M M
The most modern city on the mainland, Ming is the center of the west.
As soon as they entered Ming, they saw a scene rarely seen in any other city.
"Is it a fly? "A""A""A""A""A""A""A"""A"""A"""A"""A""""A""""A""""A""""A""""A"""""A"""""A"""""A"""""A""""""A""""""A""""""A""""""A"""""A""""""A""""""A"""""""A""""""A""""""""A""""""""A""""""""A""""""""""A"""""""
"That's right.
Now the high flying car is in the test stage, Ming is the most important technology center of the whole Union, it seems to have been very successful!
The traffic in front gradually slowed, and from a distance could be seen, at the highway exit, there were dozens of armored cars wandering around, not knowing what to do.
She suddenly said, aren't they doing an identity check?
As soon as the word came out, all the people had a blow in their hearts.
Everybody has their own ID, it's a metal card that records their identity. They have. But, before they go to college, they've all been confiscated!
"The school has to get to Ming," said Tang. "That's what it's all about.
This is...
There is no doubt our identity card will be confiscated.
Xuagashi looked back at him, "What do?
If they don't have their identity card, they'll be questioned, and then they won't know how to do it! After all, no one of them has faced such a situation, nor have they faced it in any of the cities they've gone through before.
Tang, looking at the distance of the highway exit, immediately said to She.
"Thank you," he said. "You'll keep the car as close as possible."
Sha has been driving recently, the skill has clearly improved, light driving guides the car to the edge of the highway.
"Did the dance teacher help us with the identity card? Didn't he just follow us?
As he said, he looked out of the window, but soon realized he was real.
There's a dance outside the window.
"Well, I didn't say."
Tang said to the old moon around: "Wait for you like this..."
The highway exit was getting closer and closer, and as they expected, there was a specialist at the exit who was responsible for checking the passport of the person in the vehicle.
With a flash of silver, the old moon had disappeared in the car, at the next moment, she appeared in the air a few tens of meters, with her hands in a circle, a huge ball of fire coming out, straight into the air.
Their feet are more than three meters in diameter, and with the gas of the fire, like a circle of sun just rising.
Along with flying, its volume is constantly growing, dragging out a gorgeous flame.
After the fireball emitted, silver flashed.
The moon disappeared.
Both the passing cars and the patrols were immediately attracted by the sudden rise of the fireball, and several of the carriers rapidly leaped to look for the figure of the old moon, but their attention was more concentrated on the fireball.
Cars quietly parked, in the sky, fireballs burst out, with boom, countless stars burst out in the sky, like the most gorgeous fireworks.
Without considering the attack, what the ancient moon did was to make the ball as loud as possible.
The door opened and six people quietly got off.
They didn't leave the first time, in fact, at this time also many soul guide cars stopped, inside the car people get off to watch the air ball.
Tang Rin glanced around, and drank a low,,Go!
The six easily crossed the fence and rushed away.
With the shielding of the buildings, they quickly jumped into the pile of buildings by the highway.
The warning came from the side of the highway.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
After a few kilometres of running, they boarded a bus to the city of Ming, and the six recovered; after all, they were thirteen or four years old, and were not so easily noticed.
Tang Lin bought a ticket and handed it out to his companions, and then he saw a familiar face.
The dancer sat on a seat behind, looking out the window, seeming to be thinking of something.
Tang came to him and sat down.
"Can we go directly to the Royal Academy of Souls now? Don't let us go again, you take us.
A glanced at him,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don smiles.
But the next word of the long dance, let his face smile frozen.
Didn't you just knock on the door? It's lost two cars.
Three black lines fall from the forehead, of course heartache! But heartache is something.
It wasn't the school arranged for the damn end exam.
The dance no longer care for him, close eyes to God.
Tang Lin can't help but slander, the comprehensive quality of the college, is really cruel!
At this time, there is a dance, Dan Dan is not worried, when the dance teacher get off, they get off again.
After all, as long as they are able to beat their opponents in the exchanges with the Royal Academy of Souls, they will of course get the full marks and additional marks in the final exam.
There is a big difference between the architectural style of Ming and the style of the city of Sleek. Sleek is a more humane, classical and modern, and Ming is a purely high-tech steel forest.
Each building has its own characteristics, many buildings look strange, attracting attention.
Ming is a big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They got up and they got off the car. They got on the car.
Past travelers seem to be hurrying, to look like time is tight.
The dances in one direction, and at one station another bus, and the people hurry to follow up.
Thus, after three consecutive cars, Tangling still feels, still in a steel forest.
As for the size of a city, it may not be the same as Slick, but the density of buildings and the number of people must be far more than Slick.
"I don't like it's too hasty and too depressing.
said Hu.
"I don't like how busy you are. "
As they spoke, a building in front of them attracted their attention.
On the top of the building there are several giant words, Sun and Moon Royal Academy of the Soul.
It looks like a metal building, and the lower buildings extend outwards, and connect to the other three buildings, forming a building.
Is this a college?
Isn't that's what the Royal Academy of Souls are?
It's a local!
Tang had a look at the dance, and just wanted to ask if they had gone directly, or if they had been consulted by Slick officially to the Royal Academy of the Soul of the Moon. The dance dance had already gone.
As he walked to the front of the building, a flash of light in his hand, added to one thing.
The horn is like a metal box.
This is...
As they waited for their reaction, they pressed a button above, and lifted them to the front of the building of the Lunar Royal Academy.The Lunar Royal Academy students, listen, six of us from the School of Sleek, an average age of fourteen, are challenging the strongest of you under the age of twenty, and we are here to tell you the difference between you and the strongest of the continents.
CHAPTER 42 Why not be so cruel
The sounded like a thunderstorm, and the waves were enough to make the streets all around clear.
When he had finished, he pressed a button, and then put the amplifier in his hand.
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
"Are you so good at full?"
"Listen, the students of the Royal Academy of the Soul, six of us from the School of the Sleek, aged fourteen on average, are challenging the strongest of you under the age of twenty," said Tang. "We're here just to tell you the difference between you and the strongest of the continents."
I'll go. This thing also has a recording function.
Then the dance disappeared...
The Winds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
The third sounded in his hand, and he looked at Tang Lin, "We seem to be in a pit.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
That's what I say.
Xu grabbed a fat hand, " support! "
Ancient Moon came to Tang Lin, took the soul conductor, looked at, " seems not to say anything wrong.
Tang said with a sigh, "I'd like to give the dance teacher a nickname, 'King', wouldn't he?"He finally found the switch of the soul-guide amplifier, and switched on the amplifier that had been called four times.
And in just a few minutes, they have been surrounded.
There were trainees and staff from the Royal Academy of the Soul, and there were also past travelers.
A middle-aged man with a gold hair came out of the Royal Academy building, looking at Tang Rin closing the amplifier, his face had become extraordinarily dark.
"Sleak College"The middle-aged man approached Dan Dan Dan Dan said in his ring, "We're from the outside of Sleak College, class one.
Come with me come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come come
There is a kind of feeling of being torn apart.
It was awful for a time.
"It's all gone," he said. "Wait, the big screen will be broadcast."
With that said, the middle-aged man's spirit suddenly receded, turned and walked into it.
It's that's easy? Tang looked at his companions with a heart of rage.
It's not difficult to see from the other's gestures, the one who has the power they can't fight, is probably the same level as the dance teacher.
The Royal Academy of theology is known on the mainland as Herch, and is only second to that level of the School of the Sleek.
It's not a good score, just like the dance was said!
Nevertheless, they have no way back now, only to go straight ahead.
The pressure increased in a moment, and they represented not only themselves, but also Slick.
There was a quiet stand at the corner of the street, where the six Tang Tang, accompanied by the staff of the Royal Academy of the Soul, were still cold, but their mouths were slightly raised.
This game is the real drill for them.
Going into the Royal Academy of Souls, Tang's first feeling was like going into a big factory full of modernity.
Everything was full of metal, the air in the middle of the hall, a huge metal ball floating silently, in which there was a clear embodiment of the soul leading energy, in which there was a core formula.
Light shimmers above, making the whole hall bright and soft.
The front looks more like a big company than a college.
There's a cloud on the white metal front. What's this? It's a rare metal! It's a luxury.
Unfortunately, there is no forging hammer, otherwise Tang Mai Lin is really a bit impulsive to go up to make it pure.
Middle-aged people don't speak, so walk ahead, with Tang Lin six forward.
After passing the front, two beautiful front reception stand up, respectful to him.
There were many people of all ages in the hall, many dressed in the same, white, school uniforms, and these were obviously the students of the Royal Academy of the Spirit of the Sun and Moon.
They looked at Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
School, which is welcome everywhere, seems to be the big enemy here.
Not all the trainees here have been brainwashed.
Tang Lian's heart slander. He also silently observed around.
He can only hope now that next game is a fair game, otherwise it would be no problem if people were specialized to pit them on the foundations of such a college.
The wide elevator is also white metal, here seems to be white.
The elevator went up, fast and stable, didn't have a strong impact.
Middle-aged people do not always speak, Tang Lin six people also only through the eyes of each other.
They all looked very quiet.
The elevator stopped on the sixteenth floor, and the middle-aged took the first step, followed by the middle-aged, who went to a place like a meeting room, "Sit."
Tang Lin also had a psychological preparation, who let his side is coming to the ground, will have a consciousness.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
"It's a challenge, isn't it? "The middle-aged seemed to be confirming again," he said to Tang.
Tang Rin pointed his head.
"Yes," said the middleman.
We'll give you a space to choose your opponent.
We don't take advantage of your age.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
"We are fourteen on average," said Tang.
The Middle Middle Middle Middle Middle Middle Middle Middle Middle Middle Middle Middle Middle
He's about the same age as you.
But there are two things I want to know about you.
First, this game,we will all watch together.
Second, the match will be broadcast on all large screens in Ming.
Tang Rin wasted his mind, "It's only private consultation, doesn't it need to be so loud?" he asked.
"Yes!You won," said the middleman, "and it will be a blow to all our college students.You lost, and we can blow Slick's face, so, yes."
What a pity! What a pity!
It was only then that Tang really understood why dance would challenge them in this way, and it seemed that the contradictions between the two colleges were far more intense than they had imagined.
But it's done, they're not backing, and it's going to be an unacceptable failure.
"All right," said Tang.
"You're waiting here.
The middle aged stood up and went out, the meeting room was only Tang and their six.
"Let's adjust and wait for the game. This is where people are, and who knows if there are any surveillance devices, it's easy to get into trouble if you talk too much.
Don't say anything. it's all done.
At once the old moon understood what he was saying, and all six sat on their knees, each meditating, and adjusting to his own state.
They weren't aware, because of their arrival, that the whole of the Royal Academy of Souls had begun to act.
Within an hour of this upcoming game, all kinds of propaganda have spread over the whole of Ming and even the entire league.
Sun Television across all the cities of the league announced that they would broadcast the match half an hour after they arrived.
It is also known as the Battle of the Soul Masters.
On the side of the street, the long dance looked at the large screen in front of the building, heard the same sound on a street, eyes squinted slightly.
At this moment, his soul leads communication.
"What's going on?" said Shen in astonishment.
"There's nothing going on," he said. "These little guys came to the Royal Academy of Souls and I gave them a fire."
CHAPTER 45 And Were Demonstrating
"It's a little big," said Shen. "Your brother, why don't you tell me beforehand? The Academy will be very active. The Royal Academy of the Spirits has a great deal of publicity, and the whole of Ming and the surrounding cities are now aware of it, and the whole of the Union is aware of it. If we lose this one, it will be a great blow to the Academy's reputation. Have you considered this?"
"I know my students, so I decided, the more pressure, the better to stimulate their potential.
If they lose, I am guilty of resigning.
But if they win, I'm sure in the future they'll have the right to impact this generation of Sleaks.
I believe they will use all their own to maintain the honor of the college, and I have confidence in my students.
Shen paused for a moment.Well, I'll first ask about the attitude on the side of the college.
Five minutes later, the soul lead communication again.
"Cai said," let me do it.
It doesn't matter whether you win or lose, you have to bring back some of the little guys.
They are all hopes for the future.
And Cai said.
"What do you say?" asked the dancer with a little surprise.
"She'd rather see Don lose the game," said Shen, "sometimes losing is not necessarily bad."
"It is true that is the mother of success, but it is only by continuing to gain success, by continuing to accumulate the strength of oneself, that one can truly go to the very top of success.
I am sure they will win the game.
"Well, the college will have arrangements," said Shen. "You just have to watch them."
The Royal Academy.
Tang Rin opened his eyes, looked at the clock on the wall, frowning.
It's been two hours since the people at the Royal Academy of Souls didn't come to tell them about the game.
Is it intentional to dry them here?
Through meditation, his state has ascended to the peak.
Just as the dance said, because of feeling the pressure, at this time Tang Lin, the state of mind is the best. There is a sense of power and exhaustion.
Others also finished their meditations.
"Isn't it still? Don't you want to go and see it?"
Don said,Wait.
Since they've called us, I don't think it's right to leave us here.
Maybe we need something to prepare for work, or we have to screen our competitors.
Just wait and that's it.
As he talked, the door of the conference room opened, and the old man came in again.
"The game is ready and will take place in our college.
Do You Need More Preparation?
"We're ready," said Tang.
Then come with me.
Middle-aged people do not want to introduce themselves from the beginning to the end, do not ask Tang Lin their name, turn and go.
Then he got on the elevator again, this time directly to the 36th floor, and took another elevator, the elevator seemed to be moving laterally, and then down, and sat on foot for two minutes, and the elevator stopped.
When the elevator door opened, the original feeling of metal suddenly disappeared, reflected in the curtains of a stone space, all around it is made of stone repaired, looks quite rustic.
But in these primitive stones, there seemed to be a very strange fluctuation of energy, in which the soul of Tang Mai Rin had a sense of boiling, and others had a similar feeling, as if there was something more to make them move their own souls.
The middle aged people don't say anything, just walk ahead.
The stone space is very wide.
Soon they came to a large hall of about 500 square meters, surrounded by stones and adorned with beautiful wall paintings.
Tang looked up, and the painting seemed to be a story, a boy sitting on a square, surrounded by people, dressed in the uniforms of the Royal Academy of the Soul of the Sun and the Moon, but somewhat different and more primitive than the uniforms of the day, and sitting in the middle, it was the uniforms of the School of the Sleek that he was wearing.
Who is this?
I don't know why, looking at the face of the school boy in the painting, Tang Lin felt a little familiar.
On the one side of this stone hall, there are two large gates composed of an enormous arch that opens up to 15 meters, and the arch is 30 meters wide.
It's also easy to pass.
"Here is the waiting area of the Great Battle of Souls, which will inform you of your entry into the game."
The middlemen pointed to the side of the bench, indicating that they could wait here first.
Just this big waiting area?
Tang Lin previously thought this was the place for them to compete.
In secret, he seemed to hear some noise outside, which was not true, but he could be sure that the sound was real.
The game made him feel more and more oppressed.
The Royal Academy must have been fully prepared for more than two hours previously.
The middle-aged men went to the side of the gate, and at this moment, the originally weak noise suddenly sounded, rolling and rolling, scared the Tang Mai Rin they jumped.
A fierce voice came back and said, Will we tolerate a provocation at the Slick School?
We've got to tell the continent that we are the strongest college in the whole continent.
This is... the voice of the game?
With this inflammatory speech, the roaring waves of madness.
S S S S S S S S S S S S S
"Is this a demonstration against us?"
"Let's put some pressure on us. Let's relax."
"What is stress? How much does it cost?"
Huang looked excited and jumped to try: "It looks like there are so many people who can show me the evolutionary spirit, do you say that I have the possibility of entering the inner court?"
"My star sword is hungry!"
Thank you Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank Thank
"Do you want to die?" said two voices at once.
Aside from Ye, another came from Xu, and then a large meat bag was stuck in Sha's mouth, and blocked his mouth. Sha's face flashed, and hid behind Tang Mai Lin, took the bag, and said with a cowardly face, "Captain, I am afraid.
Tang Rin turned his eyes white, "Your acting is too poor.
Star Lan, I don't know him, if you're gonna hit him, I can help you.
Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
Ballin, arrange tactics.
Tang's eyes flickered, and his head was pointed down.The old moon's hands were lifted, and the ice blue of his feet was lifted, and gradually became the ice cover, and the six were covered in it.
Anything outside can be separated from sound.
It's a completely closed space.
Ten minutes.The game is about to start.
The ice cover does not break, but melts quietly from the top, and the water elements after melting evaporate directly into the air.
The middle man looked at the disappearing ice cover, the eyes moved slightly, the control, strong!
In front, two huge arches slowly opened, which had already been very noisy, at this moment suddenly became more and more intense, and a very warm atmosphere came to face.
The world outside the arch is very bright, some can not see.
The middle-aged first walked toward the gate.
Chapter 45
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
They all got up their chests, and from that moment on, they were not representing themselves, nor were they completing the final exam.
And fight for the glory of Sleek!
Getting out of the constituency and really going into this battle of souls, you can feel how grand it is.
Even at Slick College there is no building of this size.
This is a completely imitation of the ancient battlefield. The huge square is more than 1,500 meters in diameter.
There are enough stands around to accommodate more than 150,000 people.
I'm afraid it's the biggest stadium on the whole continent.
This should be the central area of a tall building at the Royal Academy of Souls.
There were at least six or seven adults on the stage.
It is not possible for these people to be at the Royal Academy of the Soul.
But there are so many people who don't know where they come from.
Over there in the middle of the chairman's desk, Tang Mailing could feel in a way over there how heavy as the mountains were, their attention was all on the six who had just come out.
When Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
Even though their minds are very good, in the face of such a scale of attention, at one time the pressure in their hearts is also great.
Shu and Xu's intelligence is the worst, the face has been slightly white.
As you know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is more difficult than previously judged.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
His whole body washed up, and the intense fluctuations of blood burst forth in a moment, and covered all his companions, though invisible.
Feeling the burning blood on Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
An old man seated in the middle of the chair with a wrinkle in his eye, "Golden Ring?"
Rare.
Isn't it a million years? It's impossible! Even a ghost tower doesn't have a million years.
It's the same thing that happened once or twice in the history of the world.
There was a middle-aged man sitting next to the old man.
"But that one or two has to do with Slick College.
Watch closely, said the old man.
"Yes!"
Seeing the golden soul ring released on him, and the sudden height of the body, the weight uploaded by the audience decreased by a few, but soon, the previous stopped curse was elevated to a geometric state.
Tang Lin did not look at the audience, he lifted his head, and went to the Great Battle of the Soul.
At this time he had seen six men standing there in the center of the great battle.
They were all dressed in white from the Royal Academy of the Soul, and they looked, really, like they were their age.
Besides the six, there was a middle-aged man, who looked more than forty years old, all covered with a coat of armor, and it was the coat of armor.
Is it a judge? Or is it an intention to put pressure on us?
It is impossible for the first time to face such a large-scale scene, to say the heart is not nervous, but Tang Mai Lin is such a character, the greater the pressure, the stronger his own potential to stimulate.
As my friends often say, this guy is spring, the harder the pressure, the harder the rebound.
Stand tall and go to the face of the opponent.
They weren't school uniforms, they were taken away, but they were ink-green sports uniforms, representing the ink-green school that was full of life.
"Here are the rules," said the middle-aged man who stood there in silence.
"What?" Tang said to him in a gesture that he couldn't hear.
"I said the rules of the game! "The middle-aged voice mixed with some soul.
"What are you talking about? I can't hear! It's too noisy here," said Tang, looking innocent.
The middle aged faced, Are you coming to the game?
"I can't hear, what are you talking about? There are a lot of flies here. I can't hear. Can you give them some pesticide first, and let the flies calm down?"
Tang Rin, although he said he could not hear himself, but his voice was very large, and with the infusion of soul, not to say spread throughout the field, but at least the broadcasting equipment in the field had been able to record and broadcast his voice.
"Get up," said the middle-aged man with a soft face.
A white transparent mask slowly ascended from all around, looking like the essence, has been condensed up to a hundred meters in the air.
At the same time the shield has the effect of isolation, suddenly, the world quiet.
"Can you hear now? "The middle-aged looked coldly at Tang.
Tang Rin nodded, a distortion of head, hands from ears each squeezed a piece of paper, laughed, "The world is quiet.
Not just him,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The muscles of a middle-aged person are clearly twitched.
If it weren't for this crowd, he would really have gone down and pulled them out.
This game is not only on the scene so many people can see, but it is also broadcast as much as possible to the whole continent's soul guide television.
The goal is to render the game.
All the preparatory work was done to put pressure on the Slick students.
After all, at the average age of fourteen, even if the strength is strong, the boy's mentality can not be changed.
As long as they are deterred, their chances of winning increase by a few.
What they didn't expect was for Tang Lin, the guy who didn't play by the rules.
It was only such an act of taking out the papers that caused the whole thing to be agitated, and the anger of the people to come.
Unfortunately, now there is a protective covering, Tang Lin they can't hear at all inside.
When watching the match in front of the soul television, people who were not prone to, or prone to, Slick College, couldn't help laughing.
Well, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
"Here are the rules," said the middle-aged.
"Well," you said. "The Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang."
"It's a tough game, but in order for both sides to be able to realise their own strength, I will only end the game as a referee when faced with trauma, disability and death threats," he said.
Their ultimate victory depends on which side maintains its fighting power in the event that the other side's army is defeated.
Did you hear me?
"That is to say, besides not killing them, anything else can be done, and there are no limits," said Tang.
As soon as this was said, all six faced him with anger.
But they did not dare to speak in the air of his majesty.
"You can understand that," said the middle-aged, his eyes shining cold.
CHAPTER 45 I'm not joking with you
Tang said, "So can I say a few more words?"
"You said," said the middle man.
When faced with so many audiences, don't let Tang Rin speak it seems to be too non-literate.
"First of all, although we are students at the School of Sleek, this time we are only here to challenge the strength of the Royal Academy of Souls," said Tang.
But since we're only enrolling in Slick for a semester, it doesn't represent our college at all. So, we're here to represent ourselves, that's a good thing to say. We're the worst of Slick, but it doesn't represent our college.
"What?" the middle aged were astonished.
Neither he nor any of the superiors of the Royal Academy of Souls could have imagined that little man would say such a thing!
Over the previous few hours, they had a series of preparations to make the most of their voice, and they were very confident of the game. Once they won, that would be a huge boost to the reputation of the Royal Soul Academy of Sun and Moon, and, on the contrary, it would be a huge blow to the Slick Academy.
However, as soon as Tang said this, he pushed himself six to the bottom of Slick College, plus he said he didn't represent the college.
Isn't that's going to cause the Royal Academy to lose and not have the expected effect? If it loses again, where does it go?
Looking at Tang's innocent smile, the middle-aged man in the air really could not resist, he controlled the body from the sky, fell before Tang.
"You didn't say before that you were coming to the school on behalf of the School of Sleek to consult with our school," said the middle-aged man.
Tang, with a sigh, and a flash of light in his hand, took out the previous soul guide amplifier, and then pressed the button.The sound of the long, cold dance sounded throughout the field.The students of the Royal Soul Academy of Sun and Moon are listening.The six of us from the School of Sleek, aged 14 on average, are challenging the strongest of you under the age of 20, and we are here to tell you the difference between you and the strongest of the continent.
"There's not a word in these words that we're here to represent Slick College, just that we're from Slick College, we're 14 on average, and then we're going to challenge you.
Let me show you the gap with our college.
But we are ourselves!
The middle-age man washed out by his anger.
We've got so much we've got enough. What are you saying? It's just...
But these little guys are generally only fourteen years old! Can a fourteen-year-old figure out this trick?
Although he had numerous years of rivalry with the School of Sleek, in the heart of the Royal School of Sleek, the strength and authority of Sleek is undisputed.
So when they showed up, they didn't want to, they were ready to face the strongest team, and they wanted to do their best to break the reputation of Slick College.
But I didn't expect it to be on cotton.
A::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
But I can't really ask the export!
He's not going to do anything to insult Slick.
Tang Rin blinked his eyes and said, That's not a game? If you're going to lose, it's not a game.
The mid-aged man's coat of armor flickered brightly, and the atmosphere was like a living volcano that could explode at any time.
Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three Three
It's a real thing to get the Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
Just as the middle aged people were bleeding, Tang's face was suddenly full, and his voice was high, and he made a declaration full of energy.The middle aged people were restless, but at the same time relaxed, and at least these little things weren't going to play any more, or else he really wouldn't be able to get in!
"The game is ready to start. "He's up again.
"Yes, although we represent the college, but what I just said is true, we are the worst of the colleges," Tang said deliberately.
The figure of the middle aged rising into the air distorted, and risked falling from the air.
Tang Lin smiled, and took the first step, and said to his opponent, "My name is Tang Tang, the first class outside of Slick College.
He didn't say "master" this time. the worst, the first grade of the outhouse.
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
A tall and handsome young man headed by the Royal Soul Academy, whose whole body seemed to be shining, and whose appearance seemed to be fourteen or five years old, was already tall enough to be compared with an adult.
He was one of the six members of the Royal Academy of the Soul, the only one who had not changed his expression, and was not as old as Yue.
"You are so tall," said Don, "you are not more than twenty years old.
If you're too old to win, it's not okay.
The Dragon looked at him coldly, "I hope your strength is as good as your mouth.
Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go
In front of one, came to the dust, is also a woman, " snow frost!
The girl is very beautiful, long, standing beside the dust, is quite a match.
On the appearance and body, Tang Lin is stronger than the dust, but not the dust body so tall.
Snow did not look at the old moon, but looked at him, seemed to be interested in him.
"Yi" "Yi" "Yi" "Yi" "Yi"
A third student of the Royal Academy of the Sun and Moon came up, " Yu! " This is a middle-sized boy, his shoulders are wide, his arms are strong, and at first glance it is like a strong man.
"Thank you!"
"No," he said.
"The Wisdom of Xu!"
The remaining three of Slick's faculty are at the same time.
The other three followed.
"Janemer Morning!" "Janemer Morning!" "Janemer Morning!" "Janemer Morning Morning!" "Janemer Morning Morning!" "Janemer Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning Morning

The last was a soft girl, with a blue short hair, looking very pure.
But unlike the previous game where they went to the college, this time neither of the two sides offered to reveal what kind of soul master they were.
He just said his name.
"Both sides back and prepare for the game.
Distance back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Either way, as long as they win this game, there are plenty of places to write.
Even at that time they didn't admit that they hadn't come to represent the college, after all they were the students studying at Slick College.
Both sides retreated slowly, and Tang's face, which had never been seen before, had quietly closed, and this time the opponent seemed to be of the same age. Every one of them was spreading different temperaments, and again at home, absolutely not good to deal with.
You've got to be careful.
As the six retreated, the triangle was set up.
In front of the six of the Royal Academy of Souls, they also launched their formation.
Dragon Dust stood in front of him, on both sides, the tall Yu Ding and the tall Janemer Morning.
Aren't they Agile Soul Masters?
Then there were Snow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
O'Neill is in the center.
As can be seen from such an array, O'Neill should control the soul.
It's a little unclear about the snow and the heat of the day.
The distance of a hundred meters was soon enough, both staring at the opponent.
"Come on the race!"
CHAPTER 46
Along with a big drink of middle-aged people. This represents the collision of two colleges, is also the last of their six final exams, finally began.
Tang Lin did not jump out at the first time, but released the spirit with the partners.
A large number of the purple rings rising, Tangling himself three rings purple rings shining.
Not much,but they're pretty good at this age.
The Six of the Royal Academy, opposite, also released their martial spirit.
As the dust moved forward, the sound of the dragon on his body, immediately, his whole height was raised three inches, four circles of souls were lifted from under his feet.
Four!
Yes, his four soul rings are all purple.
It's a little different than Tang thought.
This repair can be compared to the maid.
Dragon Dust, the boy genius list seems to have such a name.
Sounds a little lower than that?
Do you know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's almost like a ball. You can see the power.
He's supposed to be the star of the Royal Academy of Souls at this age.
Next to the dust, Janemer and Yu Ding each released their martial spirit.
Yu's spirit is a hammer, but not an ordinary hammer, with a short hammer behind a long chain ring wrapped over his arms, a meteor hammer.
Three Purple Ring.
That's not normal.
But it's not a four.
Janemer said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It appears to be a tiger.
Defense!
The shield was so large that it was able to completely hide behind his fat body.
Among the three daughters behind them, the snow, the four, the all-purple, the three-purple, the three-purple.
Good boy, there are three four rings of soul! This battle is enough to compare with the team in our boys' talent list.
Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang Tang
The Six chosen by the Royal Academy of Souls were not excellent, but Tang believed that if they were faced with the five Mai, it would be a bit bad to say who wins and who loses.
And the others, but overcome the flower of their.
It's true that generation of students at the Royal Academy of the Sun and Moon are very good, but unfortunately they probably don't know much about Slick.
This is the first year of the School of Sleek, can only be described by surprise.
It's not clear to Tang that there's still some news on the side of the Royal Soul Academy after the initial enrollment at Slick College.
They also know that five of the top boys geniuses are the new ones to Slick College, but that's all.
While they were waiting, in fact, there was also an investigation by the Royal Academy of Souls, and none of the six of them were on the boys' list.
So people think it's all right to win.
The Dragon's left foot was on the ground, the body jumped up, the first to Tang Mai-lin on their side.
The second soul ring shining, a bright dragon singing with it.
Second Soul, Dragon!
Rolling waves like substance, around his body, light golden shadows appear, concealed like giant dragons.
The brightness washed out.
Wu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Honored as the youngest generation with the most hope of becoming a four-word archer, here, he is absolutely the pride of heaven.
When Dragon saw that was not even a four ring of the six faculty of Sleek, he recognized in his heart the word that Don Mairen recognized as the worst.
It's clear that match is live, I don't know how many people are paying attention.
It's a good time to make a name! To be able to step up on the Slick College students, to establish yourself in the spirit world, is absolutely more appropriate.
Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu Hu
Tang's three purple soul rings recovered, once used as a deterrent all the time gold rings reappeared, gold scales slowly emerged.
"Hang!" "Hang!" "Hang!" "Hang!"
One,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Good! Long Dust is happy, a pair to beat the leader of the other, it is absolutely the best time to perform.
As the two approached, the dust suddenly felt something wrong, the opponent seemed not to be influenced by his own dragon, his eyes were very bright, looking at his own eyes was also something wrong, what eyes?
What pity!
Hundred meters away from the moment of change, Tang Mai Lin also rises from the sky, while rising from the sky, the golden soul ring blossom on his body.
Dust left foot, burst into the sky, arms open, first soul ring shining, Dragon's claws!
He had no regard for Tang, could be the first genius of the young generation of the Royal Academy of Souls, his character was steady, heavy, and at any time would not have regard for the opponent.
Though he knew he should be able to suppress the other, he did his best.
Therefore, while the first soul ring shining, the fourth soul ring also shining.
Twin Rings are high-end techniques for the Master to control the Rings.
The Fourth Soul Skill, Dragon Power!
Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light Thermal Light
He wants to come up to the other one second, to directly defeat Tang Lin, to his advantage, and to destroy the decay of the other Slick College students.
By then, even if the other side said they were not the strongest at Slick, they were also Slick students!
It was at this time, Tang Rin's breath burst.
Both breathes must be in contact with the body sooner.
In that moment, the dust felt only an indescribable fear suddenly appeared in the deepest of his heart.
How is it possible? How is it possible that I am afraid? He is full of misunderstandings, but everything is before him.
He just felt like his heart was held by something and his whole blood was shaking.
In front of himself, Tang, who had also risen, seemed to be getting taller and bigger, and seemed to be shrinking in front of him.
The Dragon's claws are reduced in strength, and he is biting the teeth to catalyze the power of the soul, wanting to control his torment.
Contrary to his wishes, Tang's breath was so strong that the dragon's power collapsed directly. The dragon's power was to elevate the breath of his bright holy dragon blood.
However, at this time blood breath is directly suppressed, even the effects of soul technique are suppressed back, this is the gap between blood, and it is the strong place of the blood of the Tang Mai Jin Long.
Chapter 449 Neighbor's Dog
After carefully looking at the house, determined that there are no big problems, then basically settled, the rest of the thing Nanfeng will find the real estate agent and the owner of the original.
It's a good day. It's good to go out and enjoy.
"Don't worry," said the South Wind, "I'll be able to live in it the next time, and I'll be able to swim in the sea every day, and I'll be able to play with shrimp."
After a round in the sea was called to the shore, and played with the sand for a long time, waiting to leave, the dog's eyes stared out the window of the car, full of.
Curry is happy, lying in the car begin to imagine the future happiness life.
What is the impression on the ocean?
It feels like you don't have to pay for a seafood buffet.
His cheerful mood continued until he returned to the student dormitory.
As soon as the three south winds left, the side called on the door of the dormitory, "wrap the hair.
Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso Miso
Have a nice day?
"Wang!"
Isn't it fun over there?
Their hair jumped up again, and their tails were thrown out with special vigor.
Speak.
"It's fun," he said.
He is now proficient in changing languages, and the pronunciation standard is too low.
"Well," hesitted, then opened the learning machine.
Curl Curl Curl
Their ears trembled, their claws shrinked, and they took a step back, they thought, in hiding.

One Hundred Ocean Knowledge
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
It's all about 20 books.
There are not only electronic books, but also accompanying test questions, twenty sets.
Curl Curl Curl
The vibrating ears fell.
"You know you're looking for books fast, now you should be faster? When you've finished the twenty books in your folder, the corresponding twenty test questions are all scored, you go to the sea and play.
There are not more than fifteen days to go, said the summoner.
It's all hard knowledge, with the hair now memory and learning ability, to get the full score is not difficult.
To go into the sea, the summons are not concerned about its safety, on the contrary, he is concerned about the to eat some of the endangered animals in the sea.
It is not yet clear how large the stomach is.
During the Wharf's recordings, it had stolen food in the desert, and it had stolen food in the sea, but it hadn't really opened its stomach to eat, just because of the warning.
After all, it is not long to stop at the dock, and there is another way to call the pipes, and to take into account the others at the dock, it can not eat too much.
But when I moved to a new home and had the opportunity to go into the sea every day, without any regulation, it would have been an invasion of the species, to break the ecological balance of the area with the power of a dog.
It's not easy to restore marine life to what it is today, but it can't be destroyed.
Do not complete separate to the sea, continue with the learning machine!
On this day, the south wind has come for the new house decoration.
At the entrance, the south wind saw the coat on the wall, hanging on the dog's head, and below the dog's eyes there were tears.
As the foot slowed, the south wind shifted the view, to find the summon, to settle the matter before hand.
As for thermal side, this is the norm, the south wind has been able to look very lightly.
After talking about the decoration, the south wind remembered what was seen today, and said, "Yes boss, do you know what is on the Internet today?
What's going on his paper today? The communications are set up, and nothing important will disturb him.
During this time there is a lot about him on the internet, and there are a lot of people looking for him, and the summons can only set the do not disturb mode.
"Do you know Will's painting?" asked the south wind.
"You know, about Will's career?"
Will's final painting was called "Neighbor's Dog" and received an A+.
It's been two days, plus he's been writing papers in his dorm since this morning, and he really doesn't know what's happened on the internet.
The South Wind will listen to the information.
After Will's final exhibition, the college placed his paintings on the school's website, sparking enthusiasm.
Will successfully completed his retraining plan last year - short-to--to--to--to--to---to---to---to---to---to---to---to---to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to---to---to---to---to---to---to---to---to--to--to--to--to--to--to--to-to--to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to
Will's short-term goal was already achieved, and Will's "My Neighbor" was initially popular on the Internet, as well as online jokes that Will was summoned to paint like an alien.
This time, after "My Neighbor", "Neighbor's Dog" again climbed the day's hot list.
The Neighbor's Dog is the longest, most intensive, and most satisfying work by Will.
This painting is closer to the style of My Neighbour, but it looks more difficult to understand, My Neighbour can also be seen as a person, My Neighbour's Dog can't be seen as a dog, unless you see the name of the painting, nobody will think it's a dog or a little pet dog.
The rich color rendering, Mystery and embodiment of the atmosphere, seems to be too super secular, but also can not say where wrong, the more research, the heart will lift up a sense of tremor.
Isn't that scary?A student of the Royal School of Art, after seeing the picture, recalled the little curly dog he had met on campus, and went on the Internet to search for that dog, and was sure that he hadn't made any mistakes.
On the other hand, the people who listened to the concert also analyzed the Will painting closely, is another impression.
"Well, this painting gives me a feeling similar to the one called 'η'.
It's a little more than people understand.
Even outsiders standing in front of this painting, looking quietly for a few seconds, even if they don't understand, their hearts are hairy, and their bodies can't help feeling cold.
On the Internet, discussion is even more intense.
"I found that Will, after the training, was completely free of thoughts, which I didn't expect to understand. "
What hatred, what hatred! What hatred!
"The friend before must have never seen a picture by Will. "My Neighbour" let's see first how Will paints.
"I don't know if Will was bitten by a dog, or if he had a mental shadow, he wouldn't have been so scary!
It's called art!
"The world of artists isn't what I think it is.
I stared at the painting for five minutes, and I didn't realize what he was saying, but I felt like a good bull, and I had a strange feeling in my heart.
"These paintings belong to a deeper level and need to be studied in detail.
Isn't this painting good for sale?
"You can buy it back."
Still worth investing in Will, who is still young.
Actually, after Will's paintings were displayed on the school's web, someone looked for him to buy paintings.
The Neighbor's Dog was purchased by the last collector from Makizhou at a price well above the estimated price of Royal Art.
Some people think the collector of the Pashu is too passionate about the hair, faced with the hair, Pashu people always seem to be not calm enough.
Others think it's pure speculation, it's not about Will, it's about calling the dog, it's really unintelligible, it's like they're losing their minds.
In response, a special assignment was sent to interview the high-price buyer of the painting.
"Many people buy Will's paintings, and they're investing only in this guy, not in the paintings," said the collector in an interview.
I'm different. I'm looking at the painting, of course, for the dog in the painting.
I have a feeling that painting will be fired to the price.
"There's a really terrible sense of dogs by the people of the pasture. Humans are really weird creatures.
So, because of Will's "Neighbor's Dog" rolled up the hot search, and appeared in the headlines of the Queen's Time.
After the south wind left, the party turned over the news on the Internet, said to卷毛: "You don't go out these days, stand five minutes back to read.
It's only a six in the morning test to protect the animal see it again twice!
Chapter 450 Relocation
It took another two days to remember, with video and pictures, again and again to deepen the memory, both the old and the new centuries, to record the habits of those animals.
In order to get permission to swim freely in the sea early, rolled up again.
The last time I played it was to get my helmet.
Finally, the test scores from just passed, to 78, then to 90, and finally to strengthen the memory, can be successful.
Southern Winds thought that because of the Internet things are restricted to action, not to go out and walk, will have little emotion, didn't think that the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds of the winds.
Follow-up to the completion of the course and the completion of the final examination by the other participants in the course, the school organized a closing ceremony for the students who successfully completed the course of the Twelve Laws of the Arts.
There is no complicated link. Most of the people who have taken the Twelve Laws are not ordinary students.
The Closing Ceremony was held at the Royal Academy of Arts, where the Grand Master, as a family member, sat in the audience, watched the Grand Master's summons on the stage, tears filled his eyes, shook hands, took many photos and videos, and then sent them to his friends and to the chat group at the Hong Shui.
As soon as the closing ceremony was finished, the elder lord went quickly before the summons.
I look.
As if he had his own gold certificate, he smiled fast, took several high-definition photographs, and he handed it back to him.
Take it well. Don't get bitten by dogs.
We stopped all the old man, his grandson had a dog, and as soon as he didn't stop, the diploma that he had just gotten was dragged out and torn, and the glue didn't stick.
Grandfather looked at the hair.
Their eyes were as if they had been wronged by God.
Grandfather looked back and called to him, "Oh, you'll be fine in any case."
How many do you get every year?
The Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great
At least there's no one at home who's gotten this.
After attending the closing ceremony and taking enough photos, the elders were satisfied, and they had to go back for some time to stay in the kingdom.
Before leaving the Isle, Grandfather looked at the gentle and well-educated grandson, and without any restraint went to instruct Zheng Biang and Zheng Yu, "You must always protect the safety of the little summoner! I heard that there are many crazy fans, and the rivals also do by means, my little summoner is too good temper, not to prevent people, not to know the heart is dangerous.
Zhao:.
Do you remember what happened that year?
Do you know how his reserve officer came?
Do you know how he slaughtered people when he played games!
Don't know how thick the old man wears filters to say such a thing, or old memory decline selectively forget certain key things?
But in return, the summons now look a lot more gentle?
Isn't this art?
No matter what they think, Yan and Zhao Yu can only hard on the head of the other lord said, "Yes, sure to protect!
Grandfather left with satisfaction, waiting for him to move into his new home, and when he had time, he went to see his old home again.
Graduates are about to leave the school, but before that, the Graduates will make an academic conference report, the audience is mainly students.
It is not a formal academic conference report, but also a live channel, so that people who are not able to come to hear the report can watch it online.
He did not hide himself, and he shared his experience and skills during his year of training.
Two hours of academic reporting followed by four hours of interactive and signature activities.
Many also suggested that the faculty should stay at the faculty, so that the faculty's present strength and honours would be sufficient to become the faculty of the royal arts.
"Oh," said one of the students.
However, shortly afterwards, they found that the summoner, although gone, could always appear in the examination.
After completing one year of study, after leaving the royal arts, the party called back to Yanzhou simply pack up, and moved.
When the weather was right, the party moved from the center of Yanzhou to the seaside.
Probably smelling of the sea, the rabbit is especially lively today, moving in the tank, the two "ears" always want to explore outside.
Their plan was to make a large aquarium, to transfer the rabbit from the small aquarium to the large one.
Entering the new home Rabbits crawled into the aquarium, looking like a floating activity of cotton candy.
However, this cotton candy almost killed two burglars who entered the room.
It's a perfect.
Deadly is not only those colors too bright, but also those that look too cute.
The best thing about moving to a new home is the hair.
It finally finished the day before the move, ran and ran early today, urged the move.
He stared into the room, looking inside the game helmet one not leaked, and rolled up his own learning machine locked in the collection room, summoned to come out.
"The learning machine is also useful," he said.
Turmoil cried angrily and went out with his tail. Then he got excited and couldn't wait to visit the new plate.
Left.
Dogs are very conscious of their territory which is their nature.
Their new home was bigger, and they had a good look at it, and they waved to the other dogs in the residential area.
It's gonna stay here from now on!
When the party called to clean up, the darkness, let the three return, and let them two days off.
As soon as the three left, lay down at the door and ran.
"I want to swim in the sea," said the hair.
Just Swimmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Curly looked carefully at the face, " hungry.
Most of the time wasted by the emperor, and was only taken out by the emperor to find something to eat.
It's really hungry this year.
It was discovered long ago that the fat of the hair has been increasing.
Foods are also expanding.
Things that weren't interested in the past can now be smelled as if they're deciding whether to eat.
Once out, it smelled in the car for a long time, the south wind still thought the car was moved, nervous to stand the car to check.
Finally, it was found that the car had no problems with other stresses, except for some unknown scratches.
Later he asked, saying he was hungry, and had just smelled the food.
It knows what it can't eat, even if it's not seen, it can recognize.
It was unconditional to open to eat, now moved to a new house, hard to have the opportunity to open to eat once, of course do not want to leave, or do not want to continue to wait.
It's been there for a long time now, and it's been waiting for the three south winds to leave before it suggested going out and looking for food.
It's been a good day for the last two days.
Since the test has reached the requirement, the summon asks a few questions the hair can also answer quickly and accurately, let it out wave well.
It's easy to be noticed during the day, there's a community near the shore, and when you move today, you'll see people out of the sea on a yacht not far from you.
Wool chooses to go out at night.
"Yes," he said.
"I'd like to go and find something to eat," he said, "and I'll be back by eight tomorrow morning."
It's going to play a little more.
I think. I agree.
Take care of the weather,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes!"
Remember, you can't protect animals!
Don't eat!
Don't eat too!
I don't eat!
Let's go.
Permitted Turban Run out, under the cover of the night, into the sea.

Look at the far sea, put the dog chain on the door cabinet.
It's the first time I've put my hair out.
But he couldn't keep his eyes on him, and after such a long period of teaching he would like to give him a chance to go out on his own.
He will decide what to do next.
It's not a small thing, it's never relaxed its constraints, and if it's not guided, it can become a killer's weapon in the hands of some who have no mind.
There is no wrong with the people who use the weapon.
Having your own consciousness and perception is a complete living body.
Furthermore, the summons have always felt that his resurrection is related to the hair, but so far have not discovered what is.
Strictly protective, and guided.
But don't go wrong.
The wind was a little strong at night, and the waves brushed the shore, and then returned to the invisible.
Everything is full of unknown.
At the same time, I had no idea what to be worried about, at this time, as a real wild dog, wandering in the sea wandering.
O? Breath?
No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The coral can't eat, it goes to lick the stone next to the coral.
It's not good.
Seeing a turtle makes a joke.
It even sings.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
As a musician, can talk can sing.
Nobody's gonna hear anyway, don't worry about being found.
If it notices someone nearby, it will go deep or hide.
Despite being hungry, he did not open his mouth to eat after he entered the sea, but he intended to play first.
It's been going out for a long time now, and it's not being taken care of by anybody.
After chasing turtles and fish, ther was able to find a large fish, which still belonged to the new century marine protection group, but this did not reduce the ther's interest in it.
Protecting the animals can't eat, but don't say don't play ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
I don't eat but touch.
The fish accelerated, and as soon as the dog's legs were grinding, it followed closely, without thinking at all how it was a dog that grinded easily out of the flagfish.
After playing for a long time, the curler was hungry, and stopped to decide to eat something first.
It doesn't eat what belongs to the protective animals in the sea, it doesn't eat a fish fin, even if it can't be seen, it's also afraid.
After all, the first reaction in the brain was to read the books and the exams in the study machine, and to think face to face.
As for the protection of animals, it is not uncomfortable!
Let's go!
While excited, the hair is actually a bit confused.
Where do you come from?
As the first to freely hunt in the sea alone, the first hunt should be special, it should be the " ceremonial feeling" of the previous time the south wind?
Curls are looking carefully for today's first hunt.
It wasn't easy. It found one.
It looks like a fish in a conservation book, but it's just looking at a picture, it can see at a glance that the fish is different, it can quickly analyze the evidence, and even if it goes back to ask, it can answer with straightness.
Aside from protecting the animals, the caps act on the ground.
Although the predator is not big, less than one meter, it is very attractive.
The goal is clear.....
It's early morning.
There is still a tension in the area of anti-terrorism.
"The night patrol hasn't found any suspects, and the Voice hasn't found any suspect targets."
"Continue to strengthen the control of the target area, pay attention to patrol and close-sea detection, carefully select the small abnormal sounds and energy fluctuations, do not let one bird one fish!"
They were informed that the notorious "Tomorrow Empire" or "T" organization would launch an attack on Yanzhou at 2 a.m. Yanzhou time, they were only informed of the rough area and the exact location unknown.
Moreover, the T organization has stolen the latest kind of simulation technology, no one knows how the bunch of crazy did it.
At the same time, a hidden underground.
In the dark underground, only see the brightness of the screen.
78 people stand or sit and stare at one of the screens.
"We passed a patrol!" cried one excitedly, sweeping the bloody "T" marks on the nearby map with bloody eyes.
They came up with a new plan, the first of its kind, a test - to attack a port hundred kilometers from the city of Jiangsu using a newly developed simulated torpedo.
Although only one simulated torpedo was released, the high-energy was enough to destroy dozens of cargo ships in the port, causing a strong impact on the port.
Crossing those patrol boats in their expectation, back against the nearshore defenses is the key.
Come on, come on!
The man who holds the controller blinks at the point of light on the screen.
As he approached thermal defenses, he had to be more cautious, and to see if the new ones they had modified could succeed in deceiving the defenses of Yanzhou.
As soon as this attack succeeds, the follow-up will be immediately!
Everyone in the basement stared at the screen.
Just as we were about to enter the area of defense near Enzhou, while everybody waited to hold their breaths, the lights on the screen suddenly disappeared.
Everyone in the basement
For a moment they had a little doubt about themselves.
The man who holds the controller, the facial expressions are a little stiff.
What about me?
Look again, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone.
This sudden change made the basement a little nervous.
They thought of several possibilities, but there was no one in sight!
It's like a flower didn't come and turn. It's all over.
The psychological shock is too big for a time.
What's the matter?
"The simulated torpedo has lost contact! has not detected energy reaction! cause is unknown!"
"No!" "Isn't it a fault?"
"No," "The display," "The controller is," "but the torpedo does not respond!"
They've spent a huge amount of human and material effort, and spent a lot of time laying out the finished products!
Why did it disappear so silently?
"Have the near sea defenses been strengthened?
No No No
I don't believe!
The man who held the controller shaking lips, face twisted, full of bloody eyes filled with disgust and madness.
He can't accept such a failure!
Another, who had been sitting in the corner, with a dark face, said,Notify the others that all operations must be stopped immediately!
It took them quite a long time to develop the plan for the attack on Yanzhou, the first round, failed.
On the other hand, the Anti-Terrorism Department of Yanzhou also suspected.
Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait
There wasn't any movement.
The T group is not easy to stop, even knowing that leak will not stop, but will continue to be crazy in a provocative manner.
However, until dawn, they had no news of any unknown attacks.
There is calm on land and in the sea, and there is, of course, no blind area.
Why isn't it quiet?
It's weird.
Isn't the news wrong?
The night faded and the clouds brightened.
The sun shines on the sea, dissipates the coolness of the night.
Ha!
A dog's head came out of the water, the dog's nose sprayed, like suddenly remembering that he could breathe, exposed to the water moving, breathing in the morning moist air.
Slowly wandered to the beach, Dog Miso brought some flowers and sand.
She shivered after the shore.

Following his departure from Royalty, many looked to him for cooperation, and they felt that, once the training had been completed, business could begin.
However, it does not mean to participate in all kinds of business.
Despite being rejected, most people are not dying, the caller there can not find, after all, the caller has played before in the Queen's entertainment circle, knows many of his staff, contact the caller more easily than contact the caller.
So, I put myself a "part-time broker" title, energetic, and I ran with the work.
After summarizing his thoughts, the south wind summoned him, and he looked around without seeing any hair.
Their small team, except for the boss, is the wool the value of almost 300 million dogs, the south wind cares most.
What about the hair?
After moving to the new home, the hair is always high, why didn't see the shadow today?
He looked at the time and said,Go swim now come back.
The South Wind opened his mouth, and he thought, "Isn't it heartbreaking that you let a dog, worth almost three million, play in the sea yourself," but he finally did not dare.
With his papers in his hands, the south wind said,My boss, I'll go see the beach, and ran out.
Just outside the south wind received a call from Yi, asking how this side, whether he and left Yu come.
The south wind is looking to the beach.
At this moment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Under the sun, the south wind felt the reflected light of the dog's fur running with some metallic glow.
It's worth about 300 million dogs in our house! Even the sun gives us a metallic glow! The south wind sighed, taking pictures in the private chat group of their salty fish.
Zhao:.
The south wind continued: I've got the camera on you, have you seen? The running figure shines, and our little roll is the brightest cub in the whole area!
Zhong: It's also the most expensive
"The boss...
'The south wind,' said the boss,'I don't have time to keep an eye on the dog. We're supposed to keep an eye on it, especially when it's going to swim in the sea.'
He said the south wind ran towards the cape.
Curved by the south wind, shaking the wet dog hair.
P P
P P P
Curl has a burst and a fart.
The South Wind is excited, regret not to take the moment: "The first sight of dogs, worth close to 300 million dogs wow, no matter the burst or the fart, the breath is so long, a close smell, and a smell of smoke.
Zhao:.
The brain of the war friend has been deeply corrupted by money.
It's not saving!
The south winds like flowers "My dog is different from anybody else," the hairs over there have spread the dog's legs around the south wind, and have run back into the house.
Look at the time, 8:02.
Before he goes out, he calls his side and returns at eight.
It took more than two minutes.
The hair must defend itself.
"I got to the shore before eight! I just wanted to shake the water out of the house!
Hearing the sound of the south wind, he shut his mouth after two hums.
"I'll go to the dryer and dry the hair first," said the summoner.
As soon as the coat dried out, the summons had left the south wind.
He looked at the teeth, and there was nothing but a green trace of some kind of algae.
"How much did you eat this time?" he asked.
Speaking of this, therm came.I ate a fish, only one!The others were little snacks.
It's not enough to prove it's not enough.
It's been heard many times that raising pets cost money, especially those that eat much more, are easily thrown away.
The hair must be its own name.
It's not much!
Didn't eat one?
But he is familiar with the amount of hair.
'Really!' 'I'm not hungry!' said the hair.
Did you steal whales?
"No! I don't eat whales! I don't eat any other marine creatures! I don't eat any scales! The fish I've eaten is a little longer than I am, it's just like a marine creature, but it's not, I've seen it a few times, and I've confirmed it," said the buffalo.
This must be explained! It doesn't want to face the wall!
"What did you eat for snack?" asked the party again.
Two Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell Shell
"Well.
There was nothing unusual about the hair, except that it was a bit of a spirit. He didn't know if the hair really didn't feel hungry or if he just said that, so he was going to drop him a bowl of dog food first.
As soon as I got up, I heard a burst of hair.
Their Steps Hold.
Carefully distinguish the smell of the air, the face becomes serious.
Put the dog's bowl on one side, the caller went before the lazy rolls, squatted and looked at the rolls.
Thinking about it, he asked, What are you eating today? Have you seen it in the book?
Curl:It's kind of like in the marine protection.
The summoned the electronic book to point the hair.
It's just a little bit like that, but it's definitely not! I can see it!
It also observed when hunting, remembering the difference between the fish and the protected fish on the map.
At the summoned, therapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprap
He took a pen and drew a picture according to the description of the hair.
From this "fish" turn, calls to compare maps and to understand all aspects of the situation, draw a line.
A thought,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Looking at the lines drawn and at the T on the fish in the picture, he asked the hair again, "What is the taste of what you eat?What is the hardness?"
"I don't know."
Everything bigger than me is swallowed.
He said:
It's a perfect logic.
From this point of view, hair follows a natural instinct similar to that of wild animals - to consume the lowest amount of body energy in exchange for the highest amount of energy intake.
If you can swallow, why do you have to swallow? And if you can't swallow, why do you have to do it?
Their faces weren't clear where they had gone wrong, and they kept arguing with caution: "I don't know what the taste is, but I feel its ingredients should be more complicated than dog food.
Probably more complicated than dog food! Wouldn't it be good to try it next time? The books I've read before don't say anything about the meat flavors that protect fish, or about the control groups I don't know if it's special compared to other fish that look like it.
It's about to finish.
Their eyes shifted from their notebook, and touched the dog's hair. No, you did well.
Reassment of the praised hair, the tail of cheer.
"What do you feel now?" he asked.
"How do you feel? "After eating that fish, it's like eating a compressed cookie.
"I don't have much to eat," he said.
I'm still not sure, but I'm going to do a simple check.
After moving to the new home, the instruments used to check the hair were moved together.
Test results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Previously, heavy metals in the blood were higher than in other dogs, but now they are swallowed by suspected torpedoes, and this is the only change.
This is astonishing.
If you look closely, the coat of hair, the brightness also seems to be slightly changed.
Previously, thermal winds have treated thermal winds with thermal winds, and there has never been such a glow, it thermal winds are not common chemicals that can be easily changed.
These are changes that occur overnight.
In case, therapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprap
"You don't have tos in these two days," said the commander.
"All right.
It's been a good time, and I've eaten too much, and I've been watching TV at home for the last two days!
"The next time you run away and find a fish that will fill you, if you really want to eat it, you should eat it, and don't bite it.
Come back and tell me.
"Well," said the tail with a glee.
Next time you're hungry!
He's hungry. He thinks he can eat for at least half a month!
This can save us a lot of money!
It's always burning after eating.
Chapter 453
Eating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was supposed to see around today. He also asked yesterday how to rent a speed boat.
When I finished my studies, I was going to relax and take a few days off to catch fish and bring some fresh fish to the rabbit.
However, the returns the party to give up the original intention.
Returning to the library, the summoner scanned the paintings that had just been drawn on the notebook, divided them into several screens in front, and opened the map of Enzhou, drew a region, and placed with the paintings in front.
"T" represents the organization of tomorrow's empire that always likes to attack and hates to bring down the century again, calls for the first contact with them, at the time of the White and the Star service.
Later, we met on the other side of Whale Island.
Looking at the three lines drawn on the map, the sides analyze the objectives of the other side.
As a man who has lived for nearly a century, he is still very sensitive to many things.
Some of the effects are already deep in the soul, and even a change of body, a change of background, a life of so long in the new century of peace, can not be eliminated.
The burst of hair, with the smell of smoke, almost in a moment raised the call of the nerve.
At the end of century,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He's got that micrometer on his leg that's tied to his hair, and if anything happens, he'll get a notification on this side.
A real-time monitoring result is displayed on the screen.
Just over an hour ago, the amount of heavy metal in the blood was rising rapidly.
No, it's acute change!
Several metals have risen steeply and decreased at great speed, and there have even been some heavy metals that should not have existed in normal dogs.
These metal elements should be brought by what is eaten today.
People also consume some unnecessary elements from food, but the situation is clearly not the same.
In less than ten seconds, according to measuring instruments, the content of some or other metal elements in the hair fell from the highest alert value to zero, and from zero to a staggering number!
None of the known creatures can make such a change!
For example, according to real-time measurements, this contains several heavy metal elements that are impossible to survive in a normal human body.
Can't be dog!
But it didn't lose its vitality, and it was able to hear its regular snoring.
This sudden change is not normal at all!
Is the detector broken?
Therapist came quickly to the cage of the cage, looked at the cage of the cage lying in sleep and snoring, paused, stretched out his fingers before the cage's nose, tried to breathe.
It is not a short nose, nor is it too fat, but it likes to snore, and it is recommended to take it to the veterinarian who checked, and nothing was found.
At this time, the snoring dog, breathing strongly, not rapidly, but thermal temperature is unusually high, much higher than the detector on the dog's leg.
As a warm animal, the temperature of the gas is more than the normal body temperature, is it normal?
They beat the dog's head.
"The hair?"
Therm continued to snore.
The game was stolen.
"No," he said.
Two loud voices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not long, continue to snore.
The more serious the call.
Didn't even the word game was stolen wake up?
Looks like it's been way more serious than you might think.
It's just that's never happened before, it's not even heard, it's not even known what to do.
Is it compulsion to wake up or to continue to watch?
He's not sure if there's going to be any harm if he's forced to wake up in this case, and he doesn't dare to act easily.
As thermal alarms became sharper and sharper, the changes on the personal terminal displayed were staggering.
Heart rate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's only detectable and we don't know how much it exceeds the detectable range.
The screen is flashing, the screen is like being pulled by some force, become distorted.
The light in the room also becomes unstable, flickering, as if encountering something in the interference.
An Emergency Alarm is an electrical connection that is working.
There was a sounding like a sounding like a sounding like a sounding like a sound sounding like a sound sounding like a sounding sounding like a sounding sounding like a sounding sounding like a sounding sounding like a sounding sounding like a sounding sounding like a sounding sounding like a sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding sounding
There seemed to be a cold in the air.
Their intuition, from the wars of the end of the century, can clearly feel the unknown danger on the scalp, rapidly backwards and backwards.
The detector data acquisition interrupted, sharp alarm noise stopped.
The connection between the instrument and the individual terminal is disconnected.
The lights of the room.
The power plug is flashing current.
A cold light of metal suddenly appeared, a giant seeming to be a claw?
It's like a shadow and it's shot straight down.
Come on!
Dust and scraps of the ground were blown.
Suddenly there was a strong wind blowing up the curtains.
The entire three-floor building is shaking.
Then the light of the metal disappeared.
From appear to disappear, but blink time, like a hallucination.
Looking at the huge claw marks, and a crack of the floor, the summoner fell into silence.
There's a chair in the area that's covered with huge claws.

When buying a chair, South feels that wood is more up-to-date, and the new century wood furniture is a luxury.
But the seller also said that home dogs can choose a bit of solid furniture, especially the legs of the desk bench, unbearable.
That's why thermal wind picked the alloy.
It's solid.
But at this point, the high-end alloy chair, blown up by the seller yesterday, has become a cake, deeply embedded in the floor.
The rolls that was lying beside it, like suddenly awaken from a nightmare.
Looking with the eyes of the innocent dog, there was a confusion all around, and several large cracks in the floor were seen through the cracks.
Turtle jumped out of the dog's nest and cried with his teeth, "The enemy!
When he saw him, he ran quickly, stood beside him, and screamed at the huge nail marks that appeared in the room when he did not know.
Rear-pressed ears,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's awful.
"Oh!"
He said:
Chapter 454
The summons are really going to lower the rest period, however, the thing is not going to stop.
There was a lot of noise, and the security network of the property was located in the area, and after looking for noise, they quickly called to inquire.
Excuse me if you are in trouble. Do we need to send someone to help
"No, it's all about the dogs at home," said the commander.
The property smiled.
All right, you say it's a dog thing. It's a dog thing.
Apparently I believed.
The property will not continue to pursue, as long as it does not affect other residents, does not endanger the lives of other people, and does not make any sense to dismantle the whole of the home.
Even though the chamber was a little far away, the party had just moved, and many of them had noticed the movement of the Red Man of Yanzhou.
So, when the three south winds got the call fired, already others came to search.
A middle-aged merchant, holding a dog, said to come by a string of doors, eyes always carrying weight and suspicion.
The party did not let the other party into the room, but said that the room was more crowded, invited in the yard, and there were also table chairs.
"What's going on with the dog? Oh, I can understand your feelings, and some of the troubles are only understood by the people who have dogs."
After a while, the merchant felt that the information he had received was enough, and after a while he could not find anything, he took the dog away.
Turned around and said to the other friends in the neighborhood.
"He's a little quiet over there today," he said. "It looks like he's done a lot of shit.
I don't see a dog. I suspect he's just hit a dog.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No

People who live in this movie don't want to bomb themselves in the media, they say it in private.
Soon, a message was circulating in some circles.
It is said that person has a tendency to violence and is not honest in private.
There are also many legends.

And there are those who look with cold eyes and think they have found the truth.
It's just a new house. Who's blamed for this?
They knew what the gang were discussing in private, but they had no intention of discussing it, nor of getting the south wind to rebuild the house, and this was a low-handed matter.
Their footprints were too obvious to be destroyed by the summons themselves, so that the floor that had been torn would be directly cracked.
The next day, this newly decorated little building, has to be changed again.
Zhao and Zhao are full of shame, such destruction force must have been robbed! It is their bodyguard's dismissal!
Even though they were given leave, the security facilities in and out of the house were arranged by their own supervisors, but a hair didn't help!
It's their responsibility, I'm sorry boss for the high salary!
The two were discussing how to upgrade the security system of the house.
The south wind pale face, shaking hands touched the board embedded in the chair.
What kind of force is there to beat a gold chair that is said to bear the weight of an elephant?
On the first floor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There were murders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He did not dare to ask, neither did he intend to say, they could only hold all the questions in their hearts.
" boss, how many more people?" asked the south wind.
"No need."
He called for the south wind to deal with the repair of the house, and forth to the library in the corner hanging on the wall of the dog's head.
Before they were on the second floor, if they didn't, they would have collapsed.
Fortunately, moved home, if in the previous house, the inhabitants downstairs are uncertain about what impact will be.
After the summons came in, shut the door of the library, and shut the voice.
At this point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After the summons told him the truth, he was in a state of shock, far more shock than when he first knew he was playing the game.
Didn't you remember?
"I don't remember.
Curry never believes he's the kind of dog that breaks the house!
He pointed and took out a recording.
Although all the surveillance in the room is bad, but before it is bad, there is a recording, which is the kind of noise like an earring.
"Listen."
The hairy ears moved, and gradually, from believing that I was not such a dog, became somewhat hesitant.
"Hear," said ther.
Hasn't something like this happened before?
When was the last time you heard this?
When you were locked in.
He said:
I searched for memories of the time he was isolated.
"Whale Island?"
"Yes!"
What did you do then?
It swallowed the person.
But when I swallowed I washed up! Nobody found me!
"It's good.
Isn't there a similar situation? Think about it.
Wool recalled for a long time.
There seems to be one more, but I don't know when.
Their hair was not remembered, but they found one in their memory.
Once Will, in order to paint, to look for inspiration, to take a scroll to participate in the painting exhibition, but unexpectedly an accident, the scroll pulled Will out of the fire.
And that time, the place where the dogs were placed, the dog cages were all cut off, monitored all the strikes, until now have not found the perpetrators.
It only remembers when it bits the cage, and it's not clear what the monitoring is about.
Their hair didn't have that consciousness.
Even now, it is not known that every such change will destroy the monitoring.
From cutting the cage to destroying the surveillance, to the whale island directly swallowing people, to now suddenly turned into a big claw almost to tear down the building.
Within a short year, the change is increasing, suggesting that it is moving towards some form of change.
Like evolution.
Only how long this process will last, no one knows.
Nothing can be predicted.
More worrying is that change does not control itself.
What should be done next time something like this happens?
We've got to find someone else.
Thinking back to the size of the claws that cracked the floor, that was just one claw, if it had changed completely...
You can't fit in the house!
"What do you feel now?" he asked.
"I don't feel...
Doesn't itch my feet?
Their hair lifted one of their claws.
After the floor was ripped, the summoner looked at the dog's claws, which were presumed to have been exaggerated, and found only a few tiny marks.
Now, look at the dog's claws, all the marks are gone, the dog's claws seem to have been carefully maintained.
Then he said to his hair what he had to be careful about for a while, and he turned over his deposit, and he was worried.
It's hard to have a home.
With a helpless sigh, he called for the south wind.
Southern Wind is worried about how to repair the house while further strengthening. It was thought that the call to him in the past was to ask how to repair the house in a low tone.
"I want to buy an island," said the summoner.
South
What do you buy?
Boss, calm down!
Don't buy anything!
There seems to be no need to buy islands, even many foreigners know that private islands are devaluing!
There was a period when it was really popular to buy islands, and a group of merchants together raised the price of the islands. Later, due to environmental considerations, some of the islands were banned from selling, and the private islands that could be traded were fewer, and the price of the islands were higher.
However, outer star development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are more choices, and there are fewer.
If there is, then there is.
Nowadays there are many private islands to sell, but it is difficult to sell out.
If you want to make it easy to buy, as soon as you have the money, you can deal with it, and the islanders are very happy.
The south winds stopped the shock, cleared the voice, extruded a smile, to analyze the present situation of island trading.
"It's always going down," he said. "It's hard to sell out.
Some of the people who have been to buy the island, have bought it for a long time, do not know how many pesticides there are on the island, it is dangerous, the cost of the island is high, the cost of the initial investment is high..."
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
Hearing the analysis of the south wind, he said,The cape needs a larger space of activity.
The South Wind looked at the, and could not see half the meaning of laughing at the.
It's already decided, the south wind can only meet.
All right, I'll make a list of budgets.
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
South decided to go back and buy himself an insurance.
He's trying to ask: Do you regret giving out so much money? If you don't give out, just deal, don't say a small island, buy a group, don't say anything!
The South winds in his heart, while searching online for private islands to sell, screened for houses and small islands with a parking lot.
He estimated, and after buying a small island, the pledged savings came to an end.
If it's for other reasons, the south wind can understand, but if it's really for dogs, it's too...
On this day, he summed up from his boss an experience of life-being a pet makes a man poor.
CHAPTER 455 Nobody knows what a stranger is
This Star Island is good to buy, lots to choose from, South Wind has chosen a few, to call.
One of them was chosen.
There was a buyer looking for an inquiry, the owner was excited.
He has seen more and more people invest in foreign stars in the last two years, and he is too hasty to throw out the island as soon as possible, and he has taken a step back when negotiating the price.
The deal quickly, the previous day to inquiry, the next day to settle.
Seeing the summoned so quickly to complete the procedure, the south wind filled with helpless: the summoned the man will not invest, he needs a wise investment adviser.
I don't know what happened in that house, but what else, not so much as to hurry to buy the island?
Well, the boss is going to his music, to invest too much.
It's not just south, it's also the old master who thinks it's stupid.
Isn't it foolish to look at a star island in a downward trend and run to buy?
He's too young to move.
Their newly purchased islands are not too large, but they are quite active.
Their position is far from each of the continents, and their shape is not characteristic, and their roots are not known.
And the original owner hasn't been living for nearly twenty years, so it's just a year to send people past a simple clean two, very ecological island.
The catastrophe of the century is sweeping the world, there is no out of the world peach source, the small island here also experienced the theft of the century century, and over five hundred years, has been restored to today's flourishing.
The existing houses on the island were built more than fifty years ago, and later because storms are too frequent, upgraded twice, the call is not too active, firm, enough to live on.
As soon as the security system is put in place, the party calls for the three south winds to return to life.
The small island is not large, food is limited, is mainly from outside, the party summoned some of the goods, after every time, the lack of the goods, let the Yan Biang and the left Yu to bring them.
After the following royalties were paid, the company purchased two aircraft, which only operated in the atmosphere.
I just got some drums. I see the bottom again.
All three of the South Wind looked at him. They all had a feeling "Is my boss crazy?"
The two newly bought aircraft, one on the island, and the other one on the south wind for the three of them to carry the goods
"The boss you... stay here alone?" asked Zhao with no confidence again.
"Well," he said, "the summons seem to be very calm.
"Isn't it necessary to strengthen the people?
"No need."
"Then...
Boss, if you have anything to do, contact us immediately.
The south wind three turns on the aircraft.
Looking at the three south winds leaving the aircraft, call back to the house, will have been shrinking in the wool of the dog.
Now therapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprap
The fish I thought could withstand for half a month, I didn't expect, less than a week, and felt a little hungry.
We pulled out a big bag of dog food. 50 kilograms of stuff.
"You eat," I said, "I'll watch you eat."
Can I swallow directly?
"Yeah.
He licked his nose and walked to the bag of dog food.
Then the summon saw, as if suddenly appeared a big... mouth?
The silver metal flashed cold.
That 50 kg bag of dog food is gone.
"Are you hungry?" he asked.
Curry hesitated and pointed at him, Or... a little hungry.
That's why he's not eating enough.
He brought out another bag of 50 kg of dog food. "Can you slow down this time?
Curry's head wasted this time.
This time the call is clearer.
As the dog's head changes, the rest of the body remains in the normal dog's form.
The little curved dog's hair at that moment seemed to shrink back into the curved body.
The shape of the changing dog's head was somewhat blurred, like some kind of metal composition, and it was not clear what it was, but one big mouth with sharp teeth, opened and swallowed the bag of 50 kilograms of dog food.
Easy.
Don't say 50 100 probably don't have half a stop.
He stared at this.
Perhaps the dog can't simply identify with carbon life.
There may also be another form.
Usually it's a dog. What is a metal dog? Unknown metal forms life?
The camera that was just placed in the room, without any accident, the only part that was recorded, from the beginning of the change, has been interfered with.
Looking at the surveillance at other locations in the house, the nearest is where there is a serious fault, where there is less than 20 meters of fault, but there is also a tearing and twisting of the shot at that moment.
All electronic devices are affected.
There's a lot to prepare for the move.
Unbeknownst to himself, the electronics were no longer used, so the party called to the warehouse and searched, removing the test mirrors left by the original master.
Their hair swallowed the mirror once again, but this time it nearly choked.
It was almost pissed off by the way it looked in the mirror.
Indeed, without a mirror, do not know what is strange!
Their shock is greater than when they know they are going to break their home in their dream!
It's just that's going to be replaced by hunger.
A few times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm hungry.
You're hungry!
I can't,I ran to the sea for food.
There were no other inhabitants around this time, and they did not have to wait for the evening, and after they had been summoned, they rushed into the sea to find food.
It's like opening a switch, over the next period, the hair changes more and more frequently, sometimes playing with a hole, suddenly the claws become bigger, and dig out a hole.
Their orders weren't afraid to let them sleep in the house, or what if they accidentally dreamed of chasing the thief, and were excited to destroy the house?
And accompanied by this frequent change is a huge energy demand.
Food!
There's really no solution, only let the hair itself run in the sea to find food.
There are some important questions, which are always emphasized with the hair.
Every day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just one can't last for half a month, not for a week, and if changes are too frequent, you'll have to go out again for about two or three days.
Ribbons are also very happy to eat once and save money.
However, after swallowing the third simulated torpedo, it was no longer found, rolled up to the nearby sea of Yanzhou and ran back and forth several times, never again met.
It is known that T may have abandoned the use of simulated torpedoes.
It's not knowing what people are going to do next.
Yan's counter-terrorism has done well, and even if they don't have hair to swallow the torpedoes, the chances are that the torpedoes will be intercepted.
There's no torpedo.
This time it's going to go a little further.
With neither consent nor objection, the summoner handed over a set of comprehensive test papers, which he himself put out.
It involves dealing with all kinds of emergencies and some things that have been stressed over and over again.
T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T
With the seven, the summoned again to do the lesson, and then agreed to roll out.
This time was a little longer, and after twelve hours came back, very spirited, and seemed to have eaten enough.
"What are you eating?
"Eat a big box! "
To sum up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They also asked some details about the place where they found "food" this time, a submarine that sank in the deep sea, and what they called "food", inside the submarine, should be some kind of high-energy material.
Eight big boxes.
Because it's a bit far away, it can't control the changes of the body, and can't bring the box from the depths to be seen.
When he swallowed the first box, he felt full, and thought of taking a box back to the party to see what, and when he took it, he swallowed.
It didn't want to swallow the third, it had a summon, it didn't dare to violently bite the box, only to return to the island.
"It's good," said therap.
It's hard to meet when you're hanging.
Without a diver, the summons can not see, can only guess by the description of the hair.
This information is not enough, the sinking submarine does not know how long ago, and the cape does not know, can not draw, can only wait for the cape to provide the clue when it is looking for food.
The effect is remarkable after the hair is eaten.
From not being able to control the sudden changes, to the vague sense of the changes, before each change, can avoid unnecessary damage, the island no more suddenly pits.
Only the more frequent, the more intense.
In order to prevent aerial patrols or outer space satellites from detecting abnormal energy fluctuations, they are summoned to run into the sea whenever they feel they need to change.
There is no effect on the land or on the sea.
Over the next month, he ran out several times and swallowed the remaining boxes in the sinking submarine.
Based on the information returned from the envelope, combined with the clues found, it is essentially certain that the submarine of the T organization, which was sunk a hundred years ago by the Yanzhou Navy, and also rumors that on the submarine that sank, there were at least eight tons of A-class energy minerals...
Many people have tried to rescue, not the submarine, but the eight tons of A-class energy minerals inside.
However, they were ineffective, where they were easily swallowed by thermal currents, attacked by deep-sea organisms, said to be in the magnetic abnormal zone, communications were easily interrupted, and submarines were easily damaged.
It's not worth it for an unknown fake.
Gradually, people forget the sinking submarine, and the legendary eight tons of A-class energy mineral.
Looking at the reason that year the Yanzhou Navy suddenly moved, the side summoned silence.
It's complicated.
CHAPTER 456 The Small Island is a signal
It didn't think so much, and after eating all eight boxes, it didn't feel dead, and ran a few more rounds, and didn't find that box again.
It says don't swallow the underwater creatures, just scare them, don't eat.
It can only eat a few of the remains of the submarine, especially the energy cabin.
Above the sinking submarine, three fully armed submarines, cautiously approach the area of the ditch, which has been demonized by people.
Increasingly close to the myth of the Deep Danger Zone, they did encounter several communications interferences, so that they did not encounter strong underwater dark currents during the dive.
The extreme environment of the bottom of the submarine is somewhat restricted, gives a very uncomfortable feeling of depression, and fear of this unknown world.
Humans have gone into space, into other planets, yet still do not completely dominate the oceans, many places in the deep oceans, still are prohibited.
A::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
"I didn't find any danger," he said. "It looks like we're lucky today."
They didn't think they'd be able to do it once. This time it's a trial.
Who would have run here without being forced to do so?
Strangely enough, the three simulated torpedoes they fired back and forth, they all disappeared from the world.
All three fish attacks failed, making them more and more reluctant to defend the nearby sea of Yanzhou.
When it's so powerful that's a creepy stop!
I didn't even hear!
People in other areas of T immediately stopped the simulated torpedo attacks to explore the interception technology.
They have reason to doubt whether the cloning technology stolen from the army is a bug, or whether the army specifically planted it and then stole it from them!
In order to steal the technology, they lost many, exposed several points.
Now it seems that is a ring against their conspiracy!
It's a trick!
Their side, too, now has to change the original plan, the top of the organization has been very dissatisfied with the people in their Yanzhou branch, if they do not make some progress, they will not get into the organization, and the consequences are terrible.
Either make an attack or do something else.
After losing three precious torpedoes, the above temporarily cut off most of their financial support, recovered all torpedoes, stopped the original plan, seems to be going to dry them for a while.
Head of the T organization Yanzhou, has recently become bald.
I'm thinking about finding more people, for example, in some of the unrestricted markets in Yanzhou.
But also worried about destroying the organization's other plans, recently the organization seems to be doing more, but they are not getting the message.
Each department's operations are separate and can't find out the exact information.
Besides, the people of the Yanzhou Military District are now watching them closely, estimated to have been stopped before the mall.
You can't do it. You can only do it by looking for other ways, for example, by means of materials.
When he wanted to, he placed the object on the submarine that had been sinking for a hundred years.
One of his predecessors was in the sinking submarine, one of the people responsible for transporting energy minerals, but unfortunately later encountered the Yanzhou Navy, could not escape smoothly, in the end even the people with the submarine were blown up, one of the people in the submarine could not escape.
Eight tons of class A energy, followed by sinking into the sea bottom.
Eight tons!
How long did you save to get eight tons of A grade energy minerals!
It's all over!
The event was also a great blow to the organization, wasted for a long time, too low, entered a period of restful life.
Since then, the organization has never transported more than two tons of ore.
Unfortunately, those who were in charge of the shipment did not want to encounter the Yanzhou Navy's interim exercise, which was supposed to be held on the anniversary of the death of a great Yanzhou man.
They didn't get any news before, too suddenly, when they hear the news, they're all confused.
Yanzhou Navy!
What's the name of the great man of the century?
Like a Surname?
Whatever he calls, he is dead.
It is said that year organized many plans to burn the cemetery, but the helper to the cemetery was too difficult to deal with, never succeeded.
T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T T
In some hidden underground, the head of the T-organization's Yanzhou branch, blindly commanded the rescue operation.
If it wasn't possible, he wouldn't have put the target on this 100-year-old submarine that's been sinking in the ditch.
Although the price of the A- with the discovery of more energy mines, the price of the A-energy mines has dropped slightly, it is still worth about 1.4 billion.
Communications technology is improving rapidly, and although recovery operations have been interrupted several times so far, it is still largely good.
Looking at the approached the target, didn't encounter the darkness of the sea, didn't encounter the attack of the deep sea creatures, indeed, the gods are helping him!
"Watch out for deep sea monsters."
"Okay, but old, is there really a legendary beast here?" asked one of the divers.
"I don't know."
"The area we're near is very quiet.
Until this depth there were no fish, nor any deep sea monsters, dead water.
It's just a few shots, I'm not sure if it's a mythical giant, or there's a rumor that it's a fake.
In fact, they believed there were deep sea monsters.
Everyone in the three submarines that were carrying out the rescue mission was more alert.
There is a sinking submarine!
It's been a hundred years since the submarine first came in.
"Find the rock first!" ""Find the rock first!" ""Find the rock first!" ""Find the rock first!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Good old man!
The men in the three submarines were also excited.
Eight tons of grade A, worth one hundred forty million!
You'll get this ticket!
Three Diving Vessels One Operations Vessel Two Protection Vessels.
Just...
"Well, old man, I haven't found any ore.
"The boxes are made of special materials and are difficult to detect.
Eight tons of ore should be packed in more than eight boxes.
After a few minutes, the diver reporting the mission.
Old man, the submarine is badly damaged, with only remnants, and the edges of the sections cut out are incomplete... like being bitten by a dog.
"That's not a good laugh. "The end of the communication is frozen.
Apparently the mood is not very good.
Old man, I looked at it again, it's really a bit like a bite, it's really a deep beast!
Isn't it easy to bite a submarine like this?
To be honest,they'd rather go to Yan's tomb than feed fish here.
Find the box! cried the communicator.
"Yes!"
Ultimately, the eight tons of grade A ore defeated the fear of the deep sea monster.
However.
Old man, I didn't find the box! There's no room here, there's no room for this big piece of submarine!
A heavy breathing sounded from the transmitter.
It's probably not light enough.
I always feel like doing nothing during this time.
Find again! Find nearby!
Go Go Go
?
What are you saying? I can't hear!
Connection disconnected.
But they didn't panic, and in the process they also encountered several communication breaks, just wait for a while.
However, wait, communications are not restored, the control system of the submarine seems to be in trouble, and more and more.
Everyone in the three submarines was in a panic.
Get out! Get out! Get back to the shallow!
The submarine is more and more uncontrolled and insensitive to operation.
They took control of the submarine up to the point where the submarine's operating desk suddenly seemed to be powered out, a complete strike.
There was a sounding like an ear, and consciousness began to fade.
On the other side, the call is talking to the south wind.
He received many invitations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their mission was greater than the South Wind, but they were not complaining, but they were happy.
Their call for another salary, of course, which is not the most important, and the important thing is that the South Wind knows more people, which is good for his future career.
"Then I'm going to throw out the show, and I'm going to take only one interview on Enzhou TV, and I'm going to work with..."
Before the souther had finished, he heard the sound of the whirlwind, and soon the communication was completely cut off.
The South Wind said to Zheng and Zhao Yu: Let me say, like that isolated little island is a bad signal, always unstable.
The three southerners were afraid of losing contact with the caller, and had intended to take a look, but had received a warning from the Enzhou Coastal Monitoring Station, saying that there had been a weak earthquake near a sea ditch, that there had been a serious magnetic abnormality, and that the people who had gone out of the sea had been asked to avoid the area as much as possible, and to wait for everything to return, if not necessary.
We can't.the three south winds can't wait.
Weak earthquakes are nothing, magnetic abnormality is very trouble, who knows when abnormality will be deepened, what if flying to half all operations uncontrolled?
"Oh, it's so good in the city, why should the boss move to the small island?"
At this time, on the small island.
After the communications were interrupted, the summon found all the displays appear familiar flashes.
Get out of the house and look out to the sea.
There's a change happening.
CHAPTER 457 Dogs also have goals
The disturbance lasted for nearly two hours before disappearing, and the caller received their call, and gave a message of peace, but did not allow the three to come now.
Instead of immediately returning to their home, they sat on a shore stone and watched on the Internet reports of this offshore magnetic abnormality.
There were no casualties, as nobody was active in the region with the strongest magnetic abnormalities, and the earthquake was weaker, and the public was almost blinded to the news.
After a few minutes of news, the summons heard that something under the water was approaching at an extremely fast speed.
He didn't hide. He summoned himself to look past.
S S S
A dog jumped out of the sea, too fast, or maybe too excited, to land not steady, rolled for a long time to stop.
She threw away the water and the sandstones, rolled up her hair, and ran to her side, looking very excited, with her tail throwing out.
Didn't find any marks on his hair, he touched the dog's head, "Are you fed?"
It's full!
That's a very strong voice, with a little bit of pride.
"What's going on? You've got a bit of quiet this time.
Their calls for a few pieces of news about the event.
Looking at the news, he felt a little sad, but found that there were no serious incidents, and put down his mind.
"Can you change now?" he asked.
"Yes," said therapist.
Although there were no others on the island, due to this magnetic abnormal event, the satellite estimated to be closer and always more careful.
Go to the sea.
Their team changed their diving clothes and took their equipment and went to the farthest.
First, to avoid being detected by satellites, Second, to avoid being affected by electronic equipment on the island, stocks are not enough.
Wait for some distance from the island, dive under the water, the summon to make the hair turn.
The sun passes through the sea, shines into the water, can see some stars in the sea floating material.
There were fish of all sizes floating around on the fin.
There was a sudden fluctuation, and the fish fled in a panic.
Under the sea, a huge creature suddenly appeared, with a metal sharp and cold feeling.
The sun shines through the sea, reflecting the dark light.
The shadow with the flow of the sea, add a bit of mystery.
He has two ears,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's not even its dog.
Look at the size of the dog's mouth, swallow a man really gently.
He couldn't have imagined, as he looked at the strangeness before him, how the fur could turn from a carbon-based creature that looked like a small pet dog into a new creature that seemed to be made entirely of metal, and in the instant that had just changed, he even heard a high-frequency sound that seemed to be moving at a mechanical speed.
Wait for it to stabilize this new form before opening the underwater phone.
"It's very cool.
Can't be smaller?
"No," he said
The hair twisted its big head thought, "Not now, not later.
Now I can control deformation! I just can't keep it for long.
"I don't have to eat much anymore if I don't become like this," he said.
It looks like it's not so hungry as long as it doesn't turn into this big shape, so it can save dog food!
Their hair quickly returned to the look of a little dog.
It thinks finally solved a big problem, finally no more trouble!
There are still many questions to be asked, but this is not the place for a detailed discussion.
Returning to the shore, he entered the house.
After eating without a box, after eating the submarine, I went along the ditch, and I smelled the food deeper, and I dug it out and ate it.
"What's the food?" asked.
"It's a stone, white, round, big like a football."
More hair doesn't come out, it doesn't pay much attention when it presses, when it's too hungry, it digs out and eats.
It is speculated that may be a new kind of energy mineral, which is very likely to be higher than the energy contained in grade A energy minerals.
The stone in the ditch is either the original of the planet or the stone that fell out of the sky.
During thermal period, there were also many meteors, including energy minerals.
Calls tend to fall out of the planet.
But now the stones are swallowed up and it's really hard to identify the date.
Just make sure the stone is good for the hair.
"Isn't there some kind of stone?"
No! There is only one.
Wool also regrets that if there were more of these stones, it would not have to spend money to buy dog food, it can play in two forms every day.
It's a pity that's not enough.
The Order did not hold the question, but the question of the magnetic abnormality and the cause of the earthquake.
Take a careful look, leaning slightly on the dog's head, and argue for himself, "I can't hold too much.
Having eaten the submarine's energy cabin, and swallowed a stone that was supposed to be a high-energy mine, the cape suddenly realized that it was again deformed, and found a place to hide quietly waiting for the period to pass.
"I didn't think I'd be able to do it this time. I was looking for nobody around, and there were no more fish in the ditch.
Think of it, rolled up his eyes, shook his tail, and said, After I've passed through my transformation, I've found three submarines not far from here, all with men and all with signs of life, and I'll give them to the nearest naval ship!
I slipped through the submarine and was not found!
Just at this time the party calls concern accounts with new news.
Take a look.
It states that the Enzhou Naval Patrol has found three submarines and has identified all of them as members of T. The information on the submarines is the center of the earthquake and magnetic abnormality.
People also doubt that extraordinary event at sea was made by T, you know what is being called T now.
It took him a long time to look at the unknown, twisted head, which was scratching with its hind leg, and to say, You have handled this very well!
He wasted his mind, and wagged his tail to praise, looking with hope at the summons.
So I I can I want a game?
"Yeah.
Actually, there are some things that can be prepared in advance.
Two boxes from the side of the warehouse.
The first box is equipped with game helmet.
Their eyes were straightened as they looked at the brand new game helmet.
Real Game Helmet! Not a deceptive learning machine!
He opened the second box, smaller than the first.
Inside is a wristwatch-style personal terminal with a little dog tattoo.
Their attention shifted from the game to stick to this new personal terminal.
This is the end it's been thinking about for a long time!
Their hair licked their noses, and their tails rolled up nicely.
"Which one do you want?
Curl eyes hard on the game helmet and personal terminal, selecting difficulty like there a low voice whispering.
"Well, there's still a problem," said the party.
He opened his innocent eyes, and looked at him with pity.
"Whatever it is," said the commander.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
The summons began to show evidence, from the time the rubber was removed to the data collected from the most recent magnetic abnormal event.
"You'll interfere with electronics every time you deform," he said.
Faced with evidence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However," the summoner said, "I see that you have made great progress over this period, from not being able to control the changes in your body from the beginning, to now being able to control the complete deformation of your body, and I believe that you will soon be able to deform without affecting electronic devices."
When the listened to say this, the hair was confident again.
It's given time to make choices on the assumption that it can control its own influence on electronic devices.
Curls soon enter a new training period.
Dogs also have goals have power and direction.
Otherwise, it just wants to eat today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Therapist packed up the warehouse, tolerated the appearance of the curls.
Even if the hair is accidentally exaggerated, it is not about to break the house.
Exercise each day to feed cans, fruits, bones, etc., each to one, will try to reduce interference.
It now has more control over body changes, only the head changes, the release of interference is not so big as before, will not directly let the nearest electronic equipment waste.
The test mirror was sent back to the warehouse.
Curls occasionally take a look at the mirror to see their new form.
You can see yourself in a mirror.
To deal with this side of the roll, the side calls for the three south wind supplement.
Though there are plenty of fish in the sea, there may be energy minerals in the sea bottom, but there are still plenty of resources available.
With the orders, the three south winds are full of suspicion, this call to supplement too much, dog food cans not say, to feed the hair.
It's just, there's so much fruit, so much meat, so much compressed biscuits, that there's only one left to eat on the island?
Looking at the shopping list, South said to Zhang Biang and Zhang Yu: "I suspect the boss stole a shark...
Or any other fish? Oh, look at the quantity of this shipment, there may be more than one.
CHAPTER 458 A dog that takes a stick of bones is a good dog
The boss has a secret, but the three south winds do not dare to dig deep, they do not want to lose their jobs.
When they brought their supplies, they didn't train in the warehouse, but they lay down on their sofas and watched TV.
The south wind of finishing the goods looked back and laughed, Oh, the little hair is watching TV again?
After finishing his work, the south wind relaxed his muscles and ran over to watch TV with his hair on the sofa.
There is a dog show where the owner is proud to show off his dog.
"There are dogs. There are lands," he said, "and there are people in the pasture."
"Oh, look at the shepherd in there, and bring a present to the owner! Look at the owner laughing so much! I tell you, the dog that brings the bone rod to the owner is a good dog, and when do you bring one to the owner?
He knew that wise man was like a child, and could hear simple words and commands, so that he was a wise man, and after he had spoken, he did not think about it.
Well, I'll roll my ears, look at the south wind, watch the show on TV, lie down on the sofa and don't know what I'm thinking.
Boss, the goods have been loaded, the electronic list has been sent to you, you check, said Yu.
It's hard.
"Wouldn't you like to have a home robot next time?
"Not for now," he said.
Do not put too many electronic devices before the hair can fully control its interference.
After a while, the three south winds left.
The horse jumped up on the sofa and cried to the side: Let me go!
"Out of the door?"
Not far from the beach near the island.
It's not straightforward.
Their eyes moved, and when they saw that the dog had little, they said, Let's go.
"Wang! I'll be back soon!"
He wants to see what the dog is going to do.
It's Mo.
Since the beginning of thematic studies, thematic studies have been conducted with the help of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.
Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call Call
Before he asked if he had any trouble, whether the magnetic abnormality had been affected, he asked if he had hired more people, that the Yanzhou Navy had just captured a number of terrorists at sea, he was worried about the safety of the convoy.
Of course, this time Morang called, one after watching the news to worry about the safety of the call, the other to tell the call an important message.
"There's an important performance, which is invited by very famous musicians, and the organizer is looking at you, do you not want to go?
Listening to Moran, it came to mind that, at the end of the concert, one of the judges had mentioned an important performance, probably one that could not be made public.
"Are you the organizer?"
"The Army. There's still some way to go."
"Go."
With a smile, the other called the reply very satisfied.
"It'll be good for you later.
Someone will contact you if there are any problems you can ask him directly when you come.
You have about a month to make arrangements for the star.
"Yes," he said.
One month should be enough.
It's not yet clear which of the stars he's going to be on, but if he's going to be on, it's not three or five days away, and if he's not going to be looking at him personally, he's not going to be safe, but he's going to be risky, and he's going to have to see what he's going to do for the next few days.
If you can control and not interfere with the electronic equipment, the summoner will take the hair to the performance.
Of course,the premise is that the organizer will allow the dog.
Even if you don't have a dog, as long as you can handle the capability, will not be easily exposed.
With the stimulation of the game helmet and the personal terminal, the progress of the last few days has been obvious, and has reduced the range of interference to within the warehouse, outside the warehouse, where the interference of electronic equipment is little or no.
He talked to Morang for a few more hours after the end of the conversation.
Their hair hasn't come back.
"The hair?"
A few voices came out of the room.
I didn't hear back.
Listen carefully.
There was a sound of underwater rock near the island, like it was digging a hole.
No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He saw the legendary work of the past, "The Dog of Su".
It was written by ancient war friends.
As the leader of the field, Su's influence is not small, his speeches and stories are collected and written by the people of the field.
This book is about how to raise dogs, of course, only part of what is said by the dog, the rest of it is later analyzed and expanded.
Their love for dogs is also influenced by their ancestors.
Nevertheless, he was the first dog to be recognized on all the battlefields of the last century.
He felt he had much to learn from this old war friend who had a lot of doging experience.
Even if it turns into a mechanical dog, it's still a dog, and the core isn't changed.
As he looked, the summoner heard the silence on the shore.
Their hair came out of the sea, without considering the water that had been thrown at them, and they ran along with a bone that was much bigger than the dog's head.
When he saw the bone, his eyeballs jumped.
Probably afraid to bite the bone, especially careful when carrying the hair, in a position close to the top of the lion, slowing down to carry the bone five or six times larger than it.
Until he came to the summon, he had put down the fracture.
There were teeth on the bones, and there were cracks.
As a dog that can easily be swallowed up by a submarine, this is already the result of trying to control the hair.
After laying down the bones, curls much lighter, shakes the hair, throws away the sea on the body.
"The bone is too soft! It breaks when you touch it! It's not too hard in the stone! I saw bones in the stone last time I was digging under the sea, but they were not delicious, nor very hungry.
But it's big!
It's got a lot more bones than the dogs on TV!
It's awful!
After touching his dog's head, he picked up the bones that were in front of him.
The bone is not a whole root, it is cut by the hair, the cut surface can see some granular crystals.
Part of the bone is also attached to the stone, the hair to dig the bone will not do more fine work.
There are traces on the bone, like blood vessels.
Fossil!
A skeleton of a giant living tens of millions of years or even billions of years ago!
Destructive Disasters and Hundred Years of War Destroyed too many things, Survival is the first, All others are left behind, Anything can be the victim of that Hundred Years of War Survival.
At the end of the end of the century, the new century people began to think again, to be fascinated with the prehistoric beasts, they also tried to dig again, often only to find the remains, can dig to the complete skeleton can be the treasure of the museum town, enough for them to boast for many years.
The large skeletons found in various museums are mostly made of preserved ancient materials, and not of real skeletal fossils!
And according to nearly 20 years of fossil trading records, a tooth of a meat dinosaur 70 million years ago could hold a room of more than 100 square meters in downtown Zion, Yanzhou!
"Well, you've got your dog food."
CHAPTER 459 Their Approaches to Headlines Are Different
It really doesn't feel any better than the bone, nor does it feel any better than hunger.
However, it seems to have a very good taste of the gift.
Standing up with his chest waiting for the caller to continue to boast, he listened to the caller and said, Within a week, if you are able to control electronic devices that are less than a meter in change, the terminal and the game helmet can be given to you.
Their hair washed away by the surprise, and immediately jumped up again, shaking the tail to confirm.
"Well, start counting now."
Take off your hair and run to the warehouse for practice.
Theraptor put down the bones he had brought back, put on his diving suit and his equipment, and went into the sea, to the place where he had dug the hole.
The sea around the island is not too deep, there is a lot of dog scratching underneath, from moving up to now, the hair often plays with the underwater scratching hole around the island.
Their holes in the bones are small enough to allow them to enter themselves, and they do not use tools to dig, but they take out a small energy wave transmitter.
Without a professional probe, the summons can only judge the general situation in the rocks first with their own ears.
Listening carefully to the changes in the rock, at this time the brain called as a layered imaging instrument, to depict the general situation in the rock.
There are many interferences in the rock, but there is a preliminary understanding.
After returning to the shore, the party made marks on several grounds and brought excavation tools.
Of course, he did not intend, by himself and with his limited tools, to dig out the giant fossils that had been buried beneath for a few years, he merely wanted to do some work first, to distract others, and to cover up the "abnormal" traces that had been left in the process of caping the fossils.
Over the next few days, the summons were doing this work, and it was good to hide the giants below, large enough that some could be dug directly on the island, but dug a little deeper.
On the other side of the reel, there is a double stimulation of the game console and the personal terminal, which is just a speed of progress, it doesn't take a week, it reduces the range of interference to within a meter in five days, and then it can't wait to run to the summons and ask for a reward.
Game Machine!
Personal Terminal!
How long have you been waiting?
It's good not to make choices!
He didn't deceive therapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprapraprap
"The two things you normally do, don't get too close to change.
Remember to get the terminal down before the change. The caller will wear the dog ring with the terminal.
"Oh," said therap.
These words are not spoken, but it is not easy to get the reward!
Dog first belongs to its own game and terminal, not really protect what to do!
After wearing this special necklace, he ran to the mirror in the warehouse and photographed the mirror for nearly two hours.
Game helmet It is familiar, the terminal first contact, but the operation is very simple, it remembers to read the electronic manual written to it, it then finds the summons not to run in front, can speak directly through the terminal ~
As therm ran to therm, therm repeated the instructions for use of the children's special terminal, deleted.
But it took only five days to reduce the interference range to within one meter, and indeed beyond his expectations, it seems that the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the capability of the
We'll have to raise.
After settling the matter on the side of the cape, the side calls the three south winds, directly opened a voice group talking.
After receiving a call, the three south winds did not dare to delay, and put their hands down to wait for the boss' orders.
The three guessed the boss usually contact once a week, now it's been five days, is the thing on the island finished?
No,that's what happened last time,that's enough for him to eat and drink for a month.
What happened?
But I don't have to look at the boss like that.
Or...................................................................................................
The three restrained themselves from their doubts and waited for the word.
"The hair cut off a bone," said the summoner.
The south wind is excited: My house will take bones home!
Left Yu directly ignored the south wind, " boss, human bone or animal bone?
That was the face of the awake south wind from the mindless blow, "Yes, is it
According to the purchase contract, this island is not a dead island, since the previous owner bought, there is no accidental death, after all, the former owner has not lived anything, except simple renovation and house building, and there is nothing buried here.
Mo, is there anything that the former owner doesn't know about?
If it's just the bones of birds and beasts that don't connect to them.
The three looked as if they weren't afraid, and waited patiently for the next word.
Their initial identification was of a skeletal fossil belonging to a giant some tens of millions of years or a hundred million years ago.
Three
There was a sound.
"The fossils" "The mouths are shaking."
Zhao doesn't know much about fossils, but it's a little bit... a little bit!
"Is it a dinosaur? Is it a legendary prehistoric beast?"
When he was a child he loved the story of dinosaurs! even dreamed of being a dinosaur hunter!
"It's not necessarily a dinosaur, it's probably some kind of ocean crawler," he said.
To me it was a dinosaur whatever the specific definition of a dinosaur, terrestrial, marine, in his eyes, the kind of creatures of that period were dinosaurs!
Zheng also asked for more photos of skeletal fossils, "This bone is so big! buried under the ground must be a big guy! boss you can't dig alone now I'll help you!
There was a little silence on the side of the south wind, but after a while the left Yu and Yan Biang calmed down a little and heard the south wind speak.
boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss boss
The last half of the sentences have been broken, and you can see how excited the south wind is at this time.
Privately Traded Islands have been searched for a long time, but the early searches were mainly to find out whether there were any energy minerals, or whether there were any kinds of century-old viruses and hazards, as were the islands purchased by the buyers.
Don't worry about energy minerals, some of which have been dug up, and even islands may have become one of the untraded.
As a result, the islands without energy minerals have become commodities for merchants to buy and sell, including on the islands.
Fossils for the new century archaeology, collection, ancient biology research, etc., it is a big event, so many years down, if the number of fossils excavated is really too small, will not be gradually ignored.
In fact, there are countless fossils of ancient organisms, such as some insects, plants, etc., that can be excavated even after centuries of extinction, but people still love dinosaurs, only dinosaurs are too few.
However, who could have imagined that under a remote island, there were fossils of ancient life millions of years ago?
Fossil!
It's a real fossil!
Contrary to the excitement of the three south winds, the side summoned calmly arranged fossil mining related matters.
Find a professional team to dig fossils.
As a result, the summoned to take photographs of the excavated bones, as well as a video of the excavation, released on a social network, and said that he was looking for a professional team to work with.
After it was sent out, the call's personal terminal didn't stop ringing.
The researchers always have a way to get his communications number. The major media also come directly to inquire.
This day, many were shocked by the headlines that were sent in real time.
"The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils" "The fossils"
"Look at these bones that have been dug out are big enough, and the rest have not been dug out, it's a big guy!"
"Are you calling again? "This is a very different figure.
Did his dog dig?I doubt my dog yesterday gave me a bone with earthy taste, and a fossil!But I threw the bone in the garbage collector--I felt lost billions!
It's a big event in the new century, and it's been known all over the world.
On a nearby small island, his dog, right, the one with the price of about 300 million, dug out the bones of dinosaurs tens of millions of years ago.
This news is too much, and at the same time it is directly pulling the flow of several circles.
At the same time, more professional excavation teams are flying to the small islands called for.
CHAPTER 460
The discovery of dinosaurs on the island prompted many of the islanders who had intended to sell the seals to withdraw from the sale and contact the professional search teams to check the bottom of their islands and nearby islands.
No, at least contact three different teams check more than three times they can rest assured!
Come on! Let's see if there's any fossils on the island I bought!
At one time, many have been ignored by the almost disbanded professional rock exploration team, are alive again!
It's a pity that's where the senior research team is now, and they don't know if there's any other island, but there's definitely one, and it's a big guy!
As a result, anxious islanders were only able to find a geological survey team or other non-scientific teams, and some of those who had already fled to call the small island for a temporary change of course, thinking of first going to the employer's island to find out if there were any fossils.
The saddest thing is the former owner of the island sold to the party.
How many disadvantages of his own little island he is well aware of, is far from the ground, is difficult to manage, wants to reform is certainly costly, and in terms of market markets can not quickly commercialize, how happy to sell out, throw out a problem.
But how long does this sell?
Has it been half a month?
Looking at the news in front of him, the former owner almost bleed out, repenting and resentful, depressed face twisted.
Nevertheless, business is so, who is a winner is really bad to say, yesterday he thought he was a big winner, today to find himself losing face, look at the jokes now on the Internet who sold the island to the caller!
Thinking of the fossils buried beneath, the former island lord was dripping blood.
Oh! Oh!
He should have explored the island again!
Call!
It's dangerous!
It's too dangerous!
He didn't believe it when he didn't get the news!
I must know there are dinosaurs under that island so I'm hurrying to buy!
Yes, every action is purpose! Every action is worth studying, you can't even guess what he'll do next!
Because there are so many fields that the call for news is so widespread that the people around the world who are not so interested in the news know that.
Moran thought the party would prepare for the performance on the remote island, but did not think it was the last few days, the wind wave again!
Don't worry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Of course,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Reassment of the anxious Molong, when the conversation was finished, the summoner saw the coat come this way.
Therm ran before therm, lifted his tail, and approached therm almost in the presence of the sun.
"It's a nice new ring," said therapist.
"I'll go and dig the bones next time! "
"Do you like digging bones?" he asked.
"I like it," said therap without hesitation.
There's a game! Look at it this time it's got a game and a terminal, what a good thing!
What do you think?
He changed his mind. He was going to use fossils to feed his dogs, but now he can control his change and he can go to the sea for food.
And this fossil event is estimated to earn a dog food money, not need to hurry to sell the fossil.
Later, he picked up the bones, or some other stuff, and he helped to get the hair.
Isn't it said in the old warrior's book, "Be careful with every gift they give you," which seems to make sense.
Or you can go directly to a private collection, and collect all the stuff that comes back.
The more you think about it, the better.
Cutting bones is better than playing games at home all day.
There's a lot of strangers on the island, and the summons have told him, that he doesn't worry, that he can now control the interference, that he doesn't suddenly turn into a freak, that he doesn't worry about being exposed anymore.
However, there are more outsiders come to their own dining area,卷毛 decide to visit more dining area, both under and under water!
"Is this terminal waterproof?" he asked, worried.
"It's about two hundred meters waterproof, and it's pretty safe down there," he said.
"Two hundred meters" ""Two hundred meters? """""It's okay to be careful not to wear a terminal when you go in the water.""
Hearing the sound of the airplane landing, he rolled his hair over, and then spread his dog's legs to run over.
It's the three of the south.
The Three Winds, after receiving the call, came by horse, and when they had not yet fallen, they found that part of the island, toward the southeast, was full of holes.
But it doesn't matter!
They don't have any pain!
As soon as he came down from the aircraft, the south wind saw the cape run before them.
He looked up at the end of his neck.
Thermal Winds would have noticed, but now he had a dinosaur screen in his mind, and hadn't noticed the subtle emotions of the hair.
Now the South looks like a golden chicken with golden eggs.
"Look at our little rolls, you know you've done a great thing," said the southerly wind.
The dark dog's eyes looked at him.
Hearing the south wind,'Your master's going to come out this time, that's a dinosaur!
It's a big one. tens of millions of years ago, like a little dog like you, ten is not enough for it to tear!
Curl looked at them again and turned away.
South Wind is not enough now, he first summoned to know the situation, then with Zheng Biang and Le Yu hand to dig out two skeletons, excitedly open the camera a big shot, in the neighbourhood and social platform a round.
As soon as there were others to come, the three did not have so much leisure, dug the fossils, took photographs and finished the forcing, and went to work each other.
It is very likely that was the first complete and more than 20 meters of prehistoric animal fossils for five hundred years of the new century.
However, the islands are private property, including a circle near the island, all of which belong to private territories, and are not allowed to enter without permission of the owners, and the summons can be fired directly.
Southern Wind is responsible for communicating with these teams.
Thes also hired some to maintain order on and around the island, and the Yanzhou Navy said they would send a team to help.
There were too many people from all over the world, and the Yanzhou Navy had to pay attention.
Even if it wasn't a summon, they would have to deal with the masters.
It's very good.
Following the dispatch of the finding of a partner, a professional research team from the continents initiated a request to participate in the excavation, without being paid, provided the dispatch allowed them to participate in the excavation.
There are even people who are fighting for their titles.
In addition to these teams, the media of all sides will not lag behind, Yanzhou TV has also contracted the side to interview.
The originally cool island became extraordinary, some simple temporary housing built up.
Even the sea near the small islands are very small ships, and are increasing.
They can't log onto the island, they'll stay on the ship!
Anyone who wants to see what's going on is packed in a boat and is not allowed to enter the area of private islands.
There are a lot of private aircraft, which are not allowed to fly into private areas, which are only around, and there are people on top with telescopes to watch.
This excavation was very memorable and the teams competed intensely.
Out of these teams were selected from twelve continents, most of which were based on research.
Such a big project wasted, the teams were not so happy, but the call means they also understand, if anyone is not happy, they can leave.
There are a lot of private groups who are not allowed to enter the island. They wait for which group to go, and they crowd in.
Therefore, even if they were not willing to share with others, the twelve teams still agreed, and no one would want to give up this opportunity, and now can only cooperate.
Well, he didn't point at his hands or his feet, and he said that he had to give something to a professional to make him feel better.
This time also saw the world's first family Brian family, the other one offered to come and find him.
The Bryan family, which made an enormous contribution to the end of the century, now owns the largest private museum in the kingdom, the Bryan Museum.
The Bronze Museum has the world's only dragonhead, as well as a complete fossil of theft.
Besides the precious collections, the most famous of the Bryan family, are the people of their family.
The Bryan family, both men and women, are of great value, yet the people who have watched the Bryan family around the world know that it is a family that looks like shit.
Not long ago, there was one in the family who, looking for insect amber from 100 million years ago, almost turned himself into a wild man.
Theronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronronron
He came to seek the hope that after digging out the dinosaurs below, he could hire them for two months each year, and the Bryan Museum and the Queen's Museum each exhibit for one month.
Buying directly is a good thing, they don't mind spending more money, but the caller clearly said not to sell when they just came.
Therefore, you can only go back and ask for the second, do not buy and rent.
Now the summons do not want to say these: dig out and talk.
He'll have to see how these teams perform before he decides.
There are differences between museums in terms of their ability to manage and their importance to their collections.
Director Brian did not expect the summons to agree now, he only hoped that after the fossils were excavated, the summons could give priority to them if they were looking for partners, but with the greatest sincerity!
There were five of Brian's family who followed the director, both men and women, and they did a lot of digging.
The sweat washed out, the dust was flying, and the face was so muddy that it could not be seen, except the two hot eyes.
They don't care about the cameras they're shooting, and they don't care if they show up to the world's audience, because their family's way of doing things is well known.
What a face is important fossil!
After the division of several professional teams work more efficiently.
They were busy digging out fossils, and they were already blocked by reporters.
Regionally Advantaged Reporter of Enzhou Television first came to interview the side.
"How did you first find the fossil? Did your dog really find it?" the reporter asked, laughing at the dog who had been squatting next to him.
"Yes, the first bone was dug."
The camera is facing the curl next to the call.
Pull the dog's head up slightly, exposing the necklace on the neck, and the end with the little dog's tattoo, not let a dog's hair cover it.
Over there, the camera, after taking a moment of the dog, calls again to the side.
The reporter asked some of the most curious questions, such as why the hair can find fossils underground.
"We just bought the island, reconstruction, because of the construction, exposed the bottom rock layer, but no one notices, is the hair cut out the bone," the call said.
Several Southwind interviewers commented:
In order to weaken the ability of the ear, the boss pushed all this to the hair?
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No!
Asked why he would buy the island, he said he only wanted to find a quiet place where he could find the fossils were really luck.
Lucky?
Most people don't believe.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Does his ear need to be covered now?
Regardless of what the reporter said, on the face was a "it was" look, according to the speech exaggerated the cleverly squat next to the summons.
Well, I'm very excited.
When the interview is finished, run to visit the site, wait for the interview to be broadcast, and keep in front of the TV.
As a local television station, the news is more serious, broadcast interviews are also called originals, have not done any distortion or blur editing.
And thermal shots also have a few seconds, Now even the little news is in a high-definition environment, the official television news screen, sufficient to make the dog clear.
The terminal there, probably in order to avoid suspicion of advertising, was blocked by the television.
Always keep the hair in front of the TV
Chapter 461
Their new rings failed and the whole dog fell down.
When they came back, they saw what the southerly wind was saying to them, but they were just slowing down with their heads.
When he saw the summon, the south wind hurried to say the abnormal of the hair.
" boss," said he, "are you having a bad stomach? Or are there too many strangers on the island who aren't adapting? Are you sick?
Their call took the rope, indicating that the south wind was going to work first, and this side he was going to deal with.
By dragging the hair back into the house, the summon can roughly guess the cause of the hair.
owowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowow
When you do something, you don't think about anything else.
He lifted his head to look at him.
A large warehouse has been built on the southeast side of the island, and all the bones that have been dug are in it.
Buried under the island, prehistoric organisms are too large to minimize the damage to the fossils, and excavation is difficult, although twelve teams are responsible for excavating, but one day or two is not complete.
A large temporary warehouse was built southeast of the island, in which, apart from depositing fossils, the team's tools and supplies were stored, as well as a temporary restroom.
Although the security system has been installed, the summons more trust the capability of the hair, by the way, disperse the attention of the hair.
Recently there have been too many people on the island, and when they are on the other side of the island, they have to be carried by people, they need to put on dog ropes, and they have to be limited.
Now we're calling for free movement in the big warehouse, small, but no rope.
"If you're doing well," he said, "I'll take you out for a while," he said.
As soon as the dog's eyes light up, the moment rises.
He knew he had a time to go to the show, and he didn't necessarily follow.
It's a pleasure to say so now.
Then, as soon as the south wind had received a call, as I went back, I saw the wind blowing into the warehouse, shivering.
'Is it?' said the south wind, looking at him with suspicion.
"Keep the warehouse door."
He greeted the staff on the other side of the warehouse and put a sign on the side of the warehouse door saying: danger! do not enter!
Outgoing staff stared at the three sighs on the sign.
Danger?
What's the danger?
It's so strong, is it?
They've been working here for two days. why don't they find out what's wrong with the warehouse?
There's been a lot of dogs.
Isn't the owner's dog gonna bite the bones?
"It can't be eaten on the table again.
"It's up to him," he said, "because he chose to put it in."
Even if the warehouse staff are unwilling to see a pet dog in this place, who is to be called the island owner?
All right, you're the master, you're free.
And has entered the warehouse, also entered into the working state.
In order to bring it out to the star, check the warehouse very seriously.
Walked around the warehouse, every little corner looked at, not even a bug left.
At the end of the inspection, rolled up at the door of the warehouse, looking in and out of the staff, not screaming and running, recognized seriously as a watch dog.
At this time, some distance from the small island, there was a yacht, and there were many other boats near it, which were not visible.
We've been able to sneak into the island, and we've been pretending very well! Now that we've got the technology, it's worth buying it from the black market.
"Look at the manual, which says the latest kind of simulation technology can avoid most civilian security systems.

It's also small and can carry only 20 kg.
"If I'm not greed, I'll have a small bone, and if I don't have one or two smaller bones, I'll surely not find them."
I'm not greedy. I'm satisfied with just one bone.
We'll share the money we've sold!
"The warehouse has guards. "I'm much more careful.
"Don't worry," he said, "I've got a solvent anesthesia, enough to put down an elephant, which I can't find."
"The summons are too hasty, and when they dig into the fossils, they are unprepared, and all these are islands of the sea, and there are so many, and there are not enough guards.
Furthermore, the party believes too much in the so-called smart security system, or too young to know the speed at which electronic devices are being replaced.
Wait for the night?
Well, it's more convenient at night.
The sun is falling, the night is getting dark.
After a busy day of digging, they returned to their home, and simply finished and rested.
On the first day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, by the evening, too tight time to nourish sharp.
Within two days, according to the current progress, the giant buried under the island will be fully excavated, and they will soon be able to see the skeleton of the million-year-old prehistoric giant!
The miners went into their dreams with smiles, and did not know, in the darkness, there were many foolish shadows.
At night the small island is more quiet, at night the active insects come out.
A small reptile crawled out of the grass toward the warehouse.
On the beach outside the small island, in a search boat, several people stared at the monitor screen.
It's been taken from a crawler's point of view, and it's already close to the warehouse, and it's going to drill through the window the next minute.
Several people stared at the warehouse, and when they hadn't come to be happy, they heard a whisper of "H" and cut off the connection.
What's the matter?
It's been found.
Has the current civil security system been upgraded?
Shouldn't the next generation of simulation technology just come out and upgrade? Not so fast before.
"The security system of the warehouse is arranged with the bodyguard of a security company, say uncertainly arranged is the military equipment?"
A Silence.
But most of them are home!
On the other side of the island, there are many vessels that do not appear to be visible, and similar things happen.
Their high-price items, which are said to have been made using new technologies, such as micros detectors, spying tools, smart thefts, were sold out without returning, and each of them had just entered the warehouse, and some seemed to have been knocked down, and some had just disappeared.
Whether it's fly or it's climb or it's drill, it's all a result.
Don't say stealing bones, even cutting can't succeed!
They're also quietly asking which company is helping this side of security.
But they don't believe what they hear.
It must be the surface of the mischief!
It's too dangerous!
Indeed, the stronger the mystery, the summons must hide the bottom card!
Is Mo calling for the military help?
In the new warehouse on the southeast of the island, therm carefully took a gravely deformed reptile and placed it in a corner box.
Fifth!
Together twenty can change one game chance!
CHAPTER 462 Top predator
The security system on the side of the warehouse is controlled by the left Yu and Zheng Biang, the rowing guards, the behavior of the rubber of course is also under their supervision.
Wool knows there are cameras in the warehouse, and it knows that this is another test for it.
In order to prevent the bad habit to see what to eat, the party really did a lot of effort, this time also to test the the good of the hair.
It can swallow it can swallow, it can not even be detected by the monitor, or catch a few swallow a few play, but catch twenty can change a game, of course it can not swallow one, every put a number one, afraid of anybody moving its box.
It's amazing that's the watch tonight.
"It's a good dog to do the work! "
He's actually noticed a lot of bugs in the warehouse tonight, and it's clear that he's done some insecticide.
But looking at the one caught in the box prepared for the summons, one of which was also emitted by the lightning when the the therm trembled, Ying Biao knew that was wrong, the horse contact the summons.
He said that side of the warehouse was personally guarded by Yan Biang and Le Yu, not in exchange for the others, nor let the others near the control room, could ask for a pass directly to the command, by the south wind branch or the command himself to guard.
If there are abnormal events on the side of the warehouse, it must be notified to the party at the earliest, not to leak any information outside.
Zhao and Zhao only regarded the fossils, and did not feel that the order was wrong.
However, after the first time said this side of the exceptions to the summons, the summons only let him watch the monitoring and do not have to take care of the things the hair caught.
Yan also asked some veteran friends to learn some information.
Recently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I didn't realize that security system is not working.
Not one of those reproduction devices has been able to get close to the dinosaurs!
Looking at the hair cut into the box a seemingly uncommon weed in the gap, Yi sighed, thinking: We have to upgrade the security system tomorrow.
Doesn't everything depend on the hair, does he go all the way to the bottom of the salmon?
Over the next two days, there were all kinds of things trying to sneak into the warehouse, that looked like insects, and that looked like plants.
However, bones sent to the warehouse, none could be stolen, and under the roots of nothing sneaky flow out.
There were those who tried to buy in staff, but the team they chose were old guys, and they were strictly managed within the team, and even if they were, they wouldn't wait for the team to kick out.
When they called for a contract, it was written that if there was a problem within one team, the entire team would be responsible, not only for being excluded from the project, but also for paying a large amount of default.
That's why they're more proactive than they were when they found a problem.
At noon that day, a miner was sick and the team's professor took him to the restroom of the warehouse to rest.
The worker, with the box just entered the warehouse, was stopped by a roll of hair.
W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W W
The warehouse guard surrounded.
All the other workers looked over there.
The man who was stopped, carrying the box, was frightened. He did not do wrong, but was frightened.
The guarded him aside, and opened the box that had been staring at.
The hair washed out the tools in the eye box, the dog claws on a geological hammer.
The man who was stopped suddenly looked like this: This is not my hammer! My hammer bears my own name! There is nothing on this earth hammer!
Then he hurriedly contacted the team professor, Teacher! My box has been moved!
In order to keep his students and keep his team involved in the mining project, the team professor reacted quickly and also cooperated with the investigation.
And they have their own way of dealing.
Soon, the members of the team proved themselves innocent, and helped to catch three suspects.
What happened to this team also got the other mining team ready, except for themselves, no one can touch their own toolbox!
Their clothes are checked every day, and every person who tries to get close to them is a hundred thousand times more vigilant.
They weren't supposed to be interviewed by mainstream media, and now they are being blocked by mainstream media every day.
If nothing had happened to the box, they would have been floating, but today's thing is to give them a bowl of ice water to cool down.
It's already the last stage of excavation, looking at skeletal fossils are all out of the ground, at this time to be out of the project, absolutely is a great regret of life!
Can't fall at this critical moment!
Soon, the others on the island found that the excavation team used to laugh at the work, now, the atmosphere is quite serious.
Besides, no matter how busy, there will always be a player responsible for staring around.
With the work of twelve teams, the bones that were buried on the island were finally excavated.
Bones are relatively intact, and there are few places where they need to be replaced.
After simulating the skeleton recovery, they mounted the skeleton fossils.
At the moment the scaffold was finished, they looked up at the concrete scaffold, nearly fifty meters long, as if through time and space, they saw the sea lord seventy million years ago.
A young staffer next to me has spoken.
Several of the old professors who commanded the skeleton scaffolds were also tears.
I didn't think I could see the top predators of the ocean 70 million years ago!
After an hour of uninterrupted discussions surrounding the enormous skeleton, they had to face a problem.
"It has to have a name," said one of the team professors.
When they searched for a lot of information, they couldn't find the corresponding, and there was no doubt that they had dug out an unknown species, so they had to take a name.
But now the problem is this time not a single team found, but several teams excavated, the skeleton or the owner of the island.
According to the rules?
"Do we have the right to name?
"What's your name? Oh, your name, Lord of the Islands!"
"It's up to you to decide," said the commander.
Their professors thought about how they might be advised if they chose to name themselves, but they did not think that they had been given the right to name themselves.
In the ancient times, in many places, these fossils of scientific value of the ancient vertebrate all belong to the state.
Although the new century's cultural heritage management laws are different, the party's call to these actually has nothing to worry about.
If it's not because of hair, the summons will even donate the skeleton directly to one or several museums.
Their eyes looked at their hair, which was guarded by a box filled with crawlers.
Besides playing and eating, the dog is really not interested in anything.
When the audience called for their naming rights, an old professor was shaking with excitement, and the assistant for the blind was about to fill the old man's house with two tablets.
The names of the twelve excavation teams were discussed at length.
Finally, they gave this prehistoric top predator, named Sea Dragon.
It's the largest skeletal fossil ever found, and it's obvious that tooth eats meat, and that's true of the top predators in the ocean at that time.
It's after.
The Twelve Teams once again entered into a fierce debate.
Certainly, the newly discovered sea lion should belong to the marine reptiles, theoretically not to dinosaurs.
But mainstream folk cultures are accustomed to living in that period so characteristic creatures, called dinosaurs.
However, in the new century, many ancient biologists proposed re-establishing the classification.
There is a large gap in the new century in the study of ancient organisms, and the limited information left over from the old century, they are only as a reference, not completely believed.
They only believe in their own research.
After the drawing, ancient biology professor holds the hand: "I see you have a connection with dinosaurs, are you interested in ancient biology research?
Call:...
No.
Their purpose was to find the bones of the sea dragon.
Two days later, online platforms with news about "the sea dragon" almost cradled their displays.
No archaeology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The large crowds also have a shocking and reassuring psychology, the Internet is a blast, all kinds of stories fill the brain to fly up, as if they had seen it before.
"These'sea masters' who were discovered before now look like little brothers.
No! Real No!
Sea Lord level predator! Look forward to a sea dragon movie!
"I don't know if the shark's skeleton will be shown publicly in the future?"
"The skeleton is too expensive to be disclosed."
Models too. When are the models of the sea dragon?
"It's going to depend on how you decide.
"I declare that is the only one who can step on the head of the Prince of the Sea!"
Uh?
"Well, that's true too.
It is true that is the tomb of the king of the sea, and it is written that it is sick to step on it.
Soon a new topic emerged.
♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
South looked at the sudden rise of hot topics on the network social platform, a "Ha ha ha".
Because of the bones of the dragon, not to mention, just to pay the rent to get a good deal.
Boss, you're really good this time! You sell the bones and you're back in the billion club!
"I'm not going to sell," said the party.
After astonishment, the southerly wind, with a look of ecstasy, said, Yes! Like this precious world, the only thing to be kept in hand is to cover for two years!
"I'm going to open a collection," he said. "I'm going to have a collection," he said.
After being surprised again by the south wind, it came back to the mind, it is worth the boss, it is long to think.
Don't sell the skeleton for a while, run the museum itself, and also make money using the surrounding products!
Neptune is the largest living thing that has ever been on our planet, and there may be more living things on our planet, but for ancient researchers don't know where the energy is.
Moreover, people's feelings about the planet are irreplaceable, here is the history of human development, the history of all.
There is a tendency.
Besides these, according to today's policies and management, the planet's alien life is restricted strictly, on the value of the collection, absolutely and on the planet's head, there is no alternative.
The South Wind was satisfied with the idea of the summon.
The boss still has an investment.
"It's a top predator in the ocean, and no matter what looks powerful enough, it's already extinct," said Southwind, looking at the characteristics of all the possible sea emperors simulated by the research team.
I don't know what the top predators in the universe look like.
The south wind began to dream, " must be quite powerful.
"It's not necessarily," he said, "some creatures look cute, but they are deadly."
Southern Wind: Ha! Boss You are funny!
One day you will understand.
There was a sense of identity on the face of the south wind, and in the heart again a "Ha ha ha ha".
You're the boss You're all right, even if you say the hair is the top predator I'll hold my hands!
Chapter 463 There is no better than a dog
Widespread coverage of the giant, a large number of ancient biological research papers have been published, and many of the previously filmed documentaries that considered impossible have been overturned.
A student who studies ancient vertebrates laughed when he was interviewed by the media: "As our former teachers said, documentaries and archaeological excavations are always faced with the continuation of information.
The discovery of the dragon is a significant event for us, and we believe that in many places we do not know, there are more surprises waiting to be found.
Their mission was to dig out the dragon of the sea, to bring the attention of the people from the land to the islands and the oceans, where in the rare places, there must have been more than tens of millions of years of life, and fortunately to have escaped the disaster of the century.
The Islands!
Although not so high, there were more people willing to buy the islands than before, and the island prices quickly stopped falling and rose.
There is even ancient biology enthusiast who specially bought an island to set up his own research base and set up a new team to explore the underwater rocks.
Following the landing of the Sea Dragon, the team signed a cooperation agreement with the Bryan Museum and the Museum of the Sea, and the next two months the Sea Dragon would be shipped to the Museum of the Sea, and exhibited at the two museums respectively.
As for the Enzhou Museum...the director was so weary that he cried.
There's no way.they have a geographical advantage. After all, it's the locals.
However, on the strength, they are not temporarily able to bear all the pressures brought by the sea dragon.
However, there are two months of buffer time, they must be ready to meet the sea dragon!
Where else to put the face!
After the dragon moved out, all the attention was shifted, and the little island was quiet again. +
Their plan was to build a collection, but the small island was not a good place, and he did not know when to go out, and when someone came to do something on the island, he did not take care, and when he came back, all the things he had dug were stolen.
There was nowhere to look at a time, and at the same time there was not enough money in my hands, I could only wait to save enough money and do it again.
Sea Dragon has rented out, and there are merchants looking for him to work with. However, the focus of the party is on the forthcoming star show.
He received an invitation from the organizer.
At this point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hidden.
Top Three Outer Spaces!
Others, too little information, even military newspapers rarely report on the underworld.
However, hidden stars are recognized as having the highest scientific power.
Here are some of the things you need to be careful about. In more detail, I'll send you an electronic document, which will set out the itinerary and will be notified by a specialist.
"Can you bring a dog?" asked the party.
There was a little fluctuation in the voice that could not be heard: "You're saying curls? They can carry, and the other dogs can't.
Of course if you don't have time to feed your dog, we can help, by the way, so that it can communicate with our airport seizure team.
It doesn't come as a surprise that person knows the hair.
It's been a real success, and it's been a real success, since the airport seizure departments want to take the dog away.
Therm Star's airport did have the idea, but after knowing the summons would not let the dog out, it didn't make any noise.
Of course, they're also interested in the other's ears, except that the other's ears are too focused on the musical art, and it's harder to dig.
After talking to the host on the other side of the galaxy, the party received an electronic document containing the application guidelines for accompanying personnel and accompanying pets.
He told the three south winds, but did not tell them where the hidden star was.
All three said they would follow.
With his sharp insight, the south winds guessed that the place to which the party was summoned would be very high, so that he would not be left!
Hearing that would be the case, the southerly wind was worried: Isn't that the place where you are going will be strictly controlled and dogs will be able to carry it?
Although I don't know where to go this time, this is a complicated and strict place to look and allow to take pet dogs?
"I'll give you a link," he said without much explanation. "You just need to help me with the paper.
"I understand, boss!"
Southern Winds quickly called on Yi and Le Yu to submit accompanying applications together.
Their accompanying personnel face much more rigorous audits, the first of which is to face the political trials.
Misspeaking in public or files are likely to be punished.
"A pet has to be put on trial too?" Nanfeng was surprised, but he also filed an application for a roll.
One minute later, the ballot was passed.
The South
Is Pet Audit Now So Fast?
An Hour later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The South
The south wind didn't come to tell me when to have dinner.
"Why are you passing so fast? "Well, I...I...I wouldn't have done that," said the south wind, with a pale face and trembling.
"It's probably because you've been in the entertainment business for a long time, it's better to be strict," he said.
Southern winds still high, he is in the entertainment circle, or downstairs staff, talk may be more casual, do things may not be quite sophisticated, but what is not to say he must not have said, or done anything good!
The South Wind hasn't slept tonight.
Well, the next day received the message passed, the long-standing heart was to rest.
OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK
The following rounds of inspection went smoothly, but the last one required them to go to the designated site for physical inspection within seven working days.
They're coming together.
Boss, aren't you done? You don't have to go, I can handle these, said Southwind.
Physical examination is simple!
"I'll go and see," said the party.
Once at the designated place, three dogs enter different test channels.
Then he took a long chair and sat down to read.
Half an hour later, the hair of the little dog's claws came out, gently relaxed, without pressure.
Two hours later, Yan-be came out of the inspection channel.
There were no left or south winds, and Ying Biang was still a bit proud.
Look, he's still the strongest, White and Star served for many years, still has an advantage!
As for thermal hair, Yi is not the right thing.
He thinks the testing of pets on this side certainly broadened the standard.
Their hair wasted.
When Liu came out, the fold again, looking for a comfortable position to continue to lie down.
By the time the south wind came out of the detection channel, the cape had fallen to sleep by the side of the foot.
The south wind from the detection channel is still some dizziness, some vomiting.
"It's a tough test," he said.
It can be seen from the inside of the body test, this is definitely not a more comfortable place to perform.
Liu laughed next to: "I said south wind, you used to be white and star, no, step back step back! Start to exercise tomorrow!"
Zheng also agreed: "It is to strengthen training, you say, even dogs are better than, it is good?"
The South looked at Yan and Le Yu, already sitting in a long chair, and looked at the sleeping, snoring hair, the ecstasy.
No no no no no no no no no no no!
After many years of service, have I become a weak chicken?
Chapter 464
After the application was accepted, the party called off all subsequent invitations to cooperate, even the opening ceremony of the first public exhibition of the Sea Dragon over the Isle of Man.
Their First Show.
There was a long line outside the museum, and the people who were attracted by the sea dragon, each excited and red, even the slow line inspection endured.
There are also some dinosaur related model toys, etc., the queue people can not wait before brushing some toys to play.
When the invited media reporters entered the hall through the journalist channel, then a shot to the sea dragon.
Not all of them were allowed to land on the small islands, so no photographs were taken before this, and they were mostly transmitted to other families.
Their smiles stopped at the opening ceremony, when the two directors returned to their offices after receiving the reporters.
The Director of the Museum of the Queen looked at the several cloned mechanical reptiles on the table, look very bad.
Director Brian also celebrated: "If we were not reminded of the special upgrade, there would be a lot of losses this time."
As they handed over the remains of the dragon, the summons reminded them of the need for an upgrade to the security of the simulated mechanical technology.
The two directors greatly appreciated the first exhibition of the Sea Dragon. Of course, the recommendation of the invited party is to make special upgrades to the own museum when the Sea Dragon has not been transferred.
At the same time as the two directors were angry and celebrating, there was also a group of people who hit the emperor's idea, and jumped their feet.
"What does it mean that the requisitioned warehouses are not allowed to enter, and that he may have used some of the military equipment over there, but neither the Imperial nor the Bryan Museum are allowed to enter?"
This technology is out of date!
"I spent so much money on something out of date!"
"The seller deceived me!"
What is the latest type of simulation machine, all TM is a pit!
That's all I've spent!
Technology is not worth it, black thing, expensive, but never so pity!
A man who thinks he has been thoroughly buried, finds a seller to pay back, fails to find a man, and in anger throws a lot of money to kill the original seller, and reminds the later: "The black market has more water!"
Within T, the people who were ordered to sell the biotechnology, were furious and fled.
After discovering theft of biotechnology against the ineffectiveness of the Yanzhou Sea defense, T organization people thought to create more money with biotechnology, just encountered the big news of the call to dig out fossils, they seized the opportunity to make a set of biotechnology machines, after making a big profit on the black market!
However, shortly afterwards, the people who purchased the simulated machinery shouted back.
This convinces T's people that simulation technology is a conspiracy against their organization!
Even the military, the Navy is not able to recognize them, but the civil security system is also upgraded to the version of the anti-reproduction technology, they spend so much energy to actually steal only an outdated technology!
To create all the summons, this time indirectly stabbed T organization a knife.
Knowing that little island had anthropomorphic reptiles, the summons reported that, after the Queen's Museum and the Bryan Museum, more important places would be upgraded to anthropomorphic technology.
However, there is no time to focus on security upgrades, he is now packing up, ready to go to the underworld.
The time to leave will be a little longer, the party called to the old man and the old woman said.
No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Boss, 80 million... let the rabbit go home, said the south wind.
"Well," he said,looking at the glass, he put the rabbit in the house by the seaside, not on the small island, where if anything happened, the property would be able to respond quickly.
"Okay," said thermal wind, which was still a little uncomfortable, and continued to report on the work. "The construction team on the island has progressed well, and will be recovered when we come back.
Now, because of the remains of the sea dragon, which were dug and built and demolished on the island, the people were asked to restore, to dig the great pits of the remains, and to repair and rebuild the rest of the island.
After they had their things sorted out, they got a phone call, which was sent from the military area to their people.
The plane stopped at the landing.
Two soldiers came to verify the identity.
Call,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The soldier who discovered nuclear identity had his eyes on the roll for a while, as if he had confirmed once more that this was not the dog in the application form.
Once the four had their identity checked and had their luggage checked, the two soldiers did not have much to say, and took them onto the airplane to the Yanzhou Military Area.
The Mission will be flying together with the other invited personnel in the Yanzhou Military Area to meet at the Foreign Airport.
The three of the south, one of the special forces, and two of the outer stars of the army, at this time, with their jaws straightened and their steely faces, faced with the men of the Yanzhou army, at this time, they could not be called to the face.
However, after boarding the aircraft, the sight of the two soldiers only passed the three, and then concentrated mainly on the summons and the hair.
The two soldiers were instructed by the Multiple Career to call with his dog, and as for the three South Winds, they were not under their care, as long as they were verified correctly.
Actually, they weren't sent on this trip, they were just carrying out their duties, and they were sent to the place where they were staying recently.
There was also a box of energy minerals and some of the goods, which were to be transported to the other side of the military area.
It lay quietly on the side of the caller, and the two creeping dogs wiped their eyes, licked their noses, and lifted their eyes to the caller, and hummed.
He glanced at her, and reached for her dog.
The hair fell back safely, but a second licked licked nose, licked mouth.
A soldier asked,Is he thirsty?
"It's thirsty," said the South, "and bring it out of the bowl of water."
"Oh! "The south wind rolled out the dog bowl and handed it over.
Yan, looking at the scene, said in his mind: Oh, pet dog is cute.
He took a bowl of the soldier's water, and after thanking the soldier, he dropped half of the bowl of water in front of the cape, and pointed his finger at the cape's head to warn.
After the cutting of the hair can complete the deformation, the diet expanded, the amount of food also expanded, yesterday also put it out to look for food.
Thirst?
No,it's just a mouthful.
Of course,the facts will not be said.cannot be said.
What else can I say?
Says thermal cabin is thermal cabin?
There's some sadness.
It seems that dog must be brought by himself, or he will not be relieved, this time out to watch closely, one not paying attention, he said uncertainly can run to eat something strange, even leaves.
CHAPTER 465 Nobody wants to steal a dog
Several reporters were preparing to interview a armored division that had just returned from the mission.
Isn't that's called?
A few others looked past.
It looks like it!
From the dog who followed him, there is no mistake!
"What is he doing in Yanzhou?"
"I just found they were coming up from a military aircraft, and two soldiers were escorting them.
Interesting, what's he doing this time?
A young journalist is about to take a few photos and is stopped by others.
The young reporter calmed down and regretted the impulse.
Get inside the military area. Unless it's an arranged activity, don't shoot.
So, even if the curiosity is to die, still have to control, otherwise they will be driven out directly, career will end there.
But if they don't take pictures, they're going to gossip about it in private.
"I think it's going to happen again.
There's been news about him around the world recently, and I thought he'd been busy with the sea dragon fossils, and I didn't expect to see him here.
"I don't think I've seen any of his moves in the last few days," he said. "It's all about fossils and no trace of him."
"I listened to my friend say a lot of fun looking at him, but I didn't find anyone.
Now it's backwards, I think when I was young, the speed of the party was so painful that they were able to dig a hand out of the news we had not yet reported.
Indeed, as some of these journalists have said, because of the enthusiasm raised by the sea dragon, everyone will naturally turn to the attention of the side.
But what's different this time is that a lot of investors are also watching.
They analyzed the dragon's excavation process, thinking that the summons must have received the message in advance, then so rushed to buy the small island.
After analyzing the way of the summon, I always feel that this person every time he goes out, he will do big things.
Sea Dragon Fossil Event is definitely not the end!
This time they stared at the summoner, especially at his movements, and wondered if he had been sneaking away from the fossils, or if he had found something of value.
However.
Play Lost!
Call, including his assistant and his bodyguard, and the dog that can dig the fossils, are all gone!
Even the first exhibition ceremony is definitely something more important!
But he hasn't heard of anything recently.
Look!
What's going on the little boy?
Isn't that's going to happen again?!
However, wait,there is no news.
Don't talk about getting stuck with investors, watching the crowds on the web, looking at the progress, too.
Their last appearance before the public was in Yan, Yan Yan's netizens began to work out.
In accordance with practice.
"The king lay down this waste!"
"The king! Come out and do the work!"
"You see, we've got a campaign," said Wang, "and we've just got over a million people involved," he said, "and we'll have over a billion by tomorrow," he said, "as long as you can find out what's going on, the money is all yours!
So, thermal surge of crowd raising, put the king over the topic list.
Wang: I thank you family!
As the crowded up on the Internet, the party had transferred from the Yanzhou Military District to the Foreign Office Airport.
They'll have to stay two days at the airport, and then they'll have to go to the underworld.
Thea Airport invited other artists invited to the underworld, and also met an old friend.
Originally involved in the filming of Genesis, the anti-professional and show-the- wife of the madman, Jonathan, and his wife, Wensha, were invited to appear in the Invisible, this time accompanied by his family to the Invisible.
Joe was very happy to see the man, and he said he would wait for the man to get his luggage and speak to him.
The south wind came and said, Boss, I have seen the next artist invited, and you are the youngest of the group.
It's also the least.
Even though the word was not finished, the party understood the meaning of the south wind.
I'm not sure I'm going to get hurt.
But all these parties are ready.
As a middle-aged artist passed by them, the eye washed over the roll of hair lying on the side of the caller's feet, his eyes frowned, and he looked at the caller again, trying to say something, he opened his mouth, and finally, with a hum, he rushed away.
Standing ready to say hello to the other
The unknown artist washed away, and was summoned to know him, David Hull, one of the world's three greatest violin masters, and the benefactor of the flamboyant "Fefe" Fee Hamernick.
Recently Fee Hamernick seems to be fighting off Sallo again, online.
However, the Confederacy recently did not pay attention to their situation, and did not know how to combat.
Unlike Fi Hamernick, who usually appears in the entertainment news, this teacher has to be much lower, and rarely appears before the public except in concerts and lectures.
He had nothing to do with him before, and this was the last time he knew what the anger of the world's top violinist was.
As David Hurd away, the south wind came and said lowly, "The one I just met, the violin master, whose student was Fee Hamernick, who has a great sense of being in the entertainment world, and who is often compared to you by the people in the circle, and who thinks that you are not paying attention to the boss.
Ben has a bias. Now that you're going to the show with a dog, I'm sure you'll be more distressed.
There were too many of these things in the circle, and the south wind thought it had found the truth, and even if it had not been the truth, it was close to the truth.
The Order did not believe that was said by the South Wind, but did not understand how David Hur's anger came.
The question was not answered until Joe was coming to talk to him.
"DavidHell?You say him," said Jonathan, looking at the drawings and the rolls lying next to him. "He must be angry," he said, "because he didn't get the approval for his pet's application, and before I came, I heard him say, 'I can't take my dogs to a foreign show.'" He was depressed, and he saw you taking your dogs at the airport.
Jonathan is telling the story of the world-famous violinist's dog-slave, which his wife told him.
"The master is now the most beloved, and besides his violin is his dog, and in the presence of both of them, the beloved brother, Fee Hamernick. Here is his beloved dog.
Joe is going to pull out a photograph of David Hill's dog.
David Hur's dog belongs to the new century artificial breeding dog, has the old century three kinds of graceful dog and the hunter dog gene, which is marked by the "long hair", which is corrected looks really graceful.
The south wind came and looked.
"The master... seems to be in love with long hair.
Jo was laughing,Yeah, he likes to have long hair.
"Your dog is not particularly long," he said, "and he doesn't seem to be able to see the eyes, but you can rest assured that he is a good dog, that is, a little jealous of you, and you don't have to worry about it; he's not really good at it.
Joe was looking at his hair again, and he knew that dog had been in the news for a long time.
"It is," he said.
"I thought the news was lying.
Jo was looking at the hair with a rare eye.
With his mouth open, a drop of water flowed down, licking his mouth, seemed to be a bit agitated.
"Isn't it too hot in here?" Joe was asking.
Although he didn't know about dogs, he did know some common things, such as, when dogs are hot, they spit out their tongues, breathe out their mouths, spit out their mouths... No, that's not a mouth, that's a dog's sweat.
It's just that Joe is looking at room temperature and at room pressure. It's normal. It's not supposed to be.
"It's just not suitable," said the quiet.
"Yes, it's hard for dogs to adapt to the atmosphere of an airport.
It's awful to go out into space!
Joe was laughing at his own jokes.
He smiled politely, but in fact he was more than relieved.
The dog washed in the sea the day before the departure, hasn't changed much, hasn't consumed much energy, how can it be hungry?
It's awful.
There are too many energy sources at the airport, which is a great temptation for the spread of the recipe.
They even suspected that dog would have eaten the entire airport if he hadn't kept his eye on the curls.
After seeing his reaction, the summoner strengthened the constraints on his hair, and he taught to his hair in private, and his hair was converging, at least not always flowing with water, and his eyes were always looking around.
Those who were invited to perform, were sometimes invited to a meeting, could not always carry the hair around.
So he handed over to the three south winds.
He brought three people here just to watch the dog.
"You watch it."
The three south winds look quiet, "I understand! "
Don't let anyone steal your dog!
Chapter 466
Hidden Planet is a global area of military control.
In addition to a few places of concentration, large spaces are used for various product experiments and military exercises.
Their natural environment is not suitable for human existence, but because of thermal energy reserves, the first alien military base was built here.
Current top navigation technology, more than 90 out of hidden stars.
From the departure, to the departure of the hidden star, the summons and others do not see the outside, during this period also signed a confidential agreement, in general, they are invited to participate in the art exhibition, the others, do not be too curious.
Waiting for a line to come out of the aircraft has landed in the specified area of the hidden star.
Their speciality causes very little real information on the Internet about them, even if they have been invited to the art team several times, they only know part of the art-related information, the others don't know, or dare to know too much.
As the first to come to ancient stars, the others do not know, but he can be sure that ancient stars' energy reserves are very rich and rich in contents - the hairy mouth water has never stopped.
Out of the aircraft, looking up, you can see the huge protective caps hanging above.
Without protective clothing, you can only be indoor, but there is no sense of narrow crowd.
"This is where the teachers are going to live..."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This is a reception center with a dormitory, with a dining hall, with an activity area.
There are some things they should be aware of, and the confidentiality agreement has been signed, and for the next time they will only be able to listen to the arrangements, to cooperate with the bands and choirs of the Hidden Stars, etc., and to be free leisure within the bounds.
Families can stay together, but the assistant and the bodyguard are separated in another building.
"Come on," said the guide.
"Can the dog go?" asked the man.
"Yes."
summons come to the room with their card.
The interior is not big, but it is very well arranged, two rooms one room, bedroom and library, decoration is very technological, also with some art style.
Besides, there are dog bowls and dog toilets.
It's coming.
After a simple resettlement, the commanders gathered them together, held a small meeting, and explained the plans and assignments for the next few days.
Their invited team, there are musicians, dancers, actors, and book painters, and so on, they all have different specialties, and they all have different targets when they get to the underworld.
To cooperate with is a young artist group.
These artists are mostly amateurs who cannot use the standards of the professional.
"Is there a problem with calling you as the leader of the youth band?" asked the commander.
"No problem," he said.
Them's selection for the young band is the Mon masterpiece, the ten-minute "Legend", which is the ending of the historical series "The Creation of the Century".
For this reason, Molong said that the command must be a command.
This is an invitation to participate in the creation and to know more about this work than others.
It's also a test that's been called.
After the meeting, everyone went back to rest, and the afternoon was arranged to visit the exhibition.
Visit these, only those invited, most of the accompanying persons are not allowed, as family members, not to mention people like the bodyguard assistant.
So the party arranged for the three south winds to bring the dogs, not to follow them.
The exhibition here is mainly scientific products of navigation, the first to come here, is very interested in these things.
In the exhibition, the most interesting is the jumping engine.
The Break Engine brought the Space Age, which is considered to be the greatest invention of the new century.
The exhibition guide is introducing the relevant information of the jump engine.
"In front of us is a part of the first generation of jumping engines, which makes space jump possible, but the energy needed to maintain the stability of the jumping engines is far beyond everyone's imagination, and the old energy cannot support the operation of the engines, so people are looking for new energy..."
Their focuses on everything from breakthroughs to energy technology to mining.
For example, how did the fold engine come into being, how did it develop, how long did it take to develop, how long did it take to support the voyage, and so on.
But the people who come here know that's what people here say, and that's what they listen to.
If the guide doesn't say anything, he won't tell you anything.
The people ahead, from the discovery of energy minerals, to the upgrading of energy conversion technology, to the classification and mining of energy minerals, these are just the stories for the rest of the art group, maybe the laughs and the laughs are over, maybe they already know, the calls are being listened to seriously.
The jump engine can't understand deeply, the energy minerals he still wants to hear more.
The more we know, the more we feel.
It's too fast!
In the new century, the breakthrough of new energy and navigation technology is too fast, far beyond the expectations.
At the end of the century, he had many questions to the scientists concerned about the realization of space travel?
But the answer was: "Maybe on the day of human extinction, there may not be breakthroughs."
However, at the end of the century, only a hundred years after the establishment of the new century, there had been a breakthrough engine, which produced the seven old-class "dream team" space exploration of the new century.
It's probably unpredictable for all those who lived to the end of the century.
One hundred years seems long, but the call is too clear the situation of the late century.
In his eyes, a hundred years, may only be used for reconstruction.
The speed of actual development of the new century seems to be a miracle.
It's been five years since the first generation of the engine was developed.
It's a pity we can't see.
However, it is also very good to see part of the first-generation jump engine.
My heart is filled with joy.
Nobody knows how he feels about the artists who are invited to the exhibition are not necessarily interested in these, so staying in the exhibition is not long, after which there is a small meeting, where fans from all sectors of the underworld come to see their own idols.
Signed, signed, lots of people, but not confused, very disciplined.
The special management environment makes this fan meet more efficiently.
The fans who can come are also screened, too many people who want to come, can only control the number.
Fan, some young and some old, especially those who have seen the Book of Genesis, look at Fan with compassion.
Nearby, two meeting organizers and senior managers came and laughed at the long line standing there.
It doesn't seem like there's a lot of fans on this side of the hidden star!
"Our parents and grandparents like him, and he's really good, but it's a little unfortunate that he doesn't continue to develop in the army.
Say, Why didn't you see Xiaoyuan? Didn't hesitate to call for a big party?
"Yes, but I didn't see anybody.
By making a list, Yuan's little boy always asks me about the invited artist, and I give him the timetable.
"The meeting is limited to half an hour.
Have you forgotten to sleep? Or have you worked too hard to forget? Or have you been working for some time?
Institute of Advanced Technology.
A young man who looks like a college student is sitting on a chair, banging on the table with his fingers, watching the time.
The Inspector, sitting opposite him, took the last thing from the box and placed it on the table.
"So, you want to make these...
"A starship," the inspector pointed out, "a starship."
That's right!
"But these are not yet public, not to mention the confidentiality technology involved, and neither of them will be public in at least two decades.
These are just models!
" Models don't work.
Please be wise.
Yuan took a deep breath.I'm a star hunter, but I'm an intellectual, and I'm different from those who shut their eyes and blew their brains without any basis!
"I don't doubt the intelligence of a gold medal engineer.
The Inspector's face remained unchanged, "Your former idol is not the Star Master?"
"Now my idol is the Master of the Stars! It is the God of all of us in our institute!
Call is my idol. I just think he is a bully!
What is the star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star star
The Inspector pointed out understanding.
He knew that transboundary influence was too strong, not to mention that he was also a soldier.
Only a few twenty-year-olds were invited to the show.
Seeing the opposite, Yuan continued, Didn't you hear one word? 'The goal is ahead, the idol is around', that's a spirit of encouragement.
Security Officer again pointed out understanding.
He heard that Yuan went from being a silver medal engineer to being a gold medal engineer when he was summoned to the silver medal table for the highest art award.
Of course, youngsters, more impulsive, he can understand.
When he was young, he also admired a basketball star from Mazhou. Unfortunately, that basketball star did not pass the examination, could not come, and all those invited to come here, had to pass the examination, in addition to their own professional ability, had to examine the personality, etc.
By contrast, Yuan is lucky, at least the tracker can see the other person's real.
It's just that person, even though he's powerful, is too young to keep a secret.
Unpublished model, or not send out good.
Seeing the other side again tight, Yuan quickly play the card of emotion.
"Uncle," "You're watching me grow up," "I'm who I am," "You know, in the face of idols, I certainly want to show off my accomplishments."
I'm just making models of some of the machines involved in my project, and some of the key areas are still vague, and there's absolutely no concealment!
"Of course I believe you," said the security officer, "but the second application is rejected."
"Uncle..." Yuan's face is poor.
"All models are held. Sorry.
Yuan said tears were coming down.
He's been preparing for a long time to make a model of a spaceship!
Seeing Yuan sadly sitting there, in a way that was severely affected, the security guard sigh, "So.
Yuan looked up at the other, and, behold, the security guard took one of the model ships, and cut off the engine parts, and put them in front of him.
Yuan wasted his breath.
Then he said with a collapsed face: "It's not easy for me to call my brother to the show, so I'll send him a... spare part?"
The Inspector said,This is the bottom line.
Children,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Chapter 467
By the time Yuan arrived at the meeting, there had been finished, the artists had left by the return vehicle.
There's no way, Yuan can only turn the way to find the door.
It's not easy to get to see an idol, but you can't miss the opportunity.
For the invited artists, arriving on the first day of the hidden star, the arrangement is still very tight, the older have been mentally ill, face tired.
After returning from the meeting, the party summoned to receive the hair.
Boss, isn't the hair adapted to the conditions here? How do I see it is always running out of water and breathing?
"It's been two days," said the commander.
The South Wind thought,Yes,the conditions here in the shadow really need time to adapt, so I and Zhao Yu and Zhao Yu, just arrived, too, a little dizzy.
"The man at the reception," said the man, "let go and take it."
Seeing the other artists face ready to go back to rest, the south wind didn't say much, "The boss, you go back and adjust well, anything directly contact, we'll do it, at any time!
Okay, you go back and rest.
Therm brought therm back to the room and poured therm a bowl of dog food.
It's a very precious thing to eat.
There's nothing left in the bowl. The next one has to wait for four or five hours.
It can't do what it wants to do.
It can't eat anything but dog food.
"Let's learn how to control," said the commander. "If you are doing well, you can watch television.
It's live on this side.
He swallowed the dog food in the bowl, and licked the clean dog bowl, and pushed it forward, which means- Look, I don't even swallow the bowl, am I well?
All right, you go to the tv yourself.
As soon as the phone rang, he ran to open the television in the room, called to the news channel, and put out a very serious dog.
After a while, the party called to the library.
He looked quietly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inside the library, the summons sighed silently.
He didn't know the little movements of the hair, but pretended he didn't find them, that something could distract his attention, and that he wouldn't have to look around at the water.
Having arranged the manuscripts in hand, the party calls on to continue to modify the program.
For this performance, the party to re-create the legend, to give it a new life.
Their work has been seen and passed.
To say, to the understanding of the work, to the composer's will, it is only to believe.
So, there's a lot of calls, and then he needs to communicate with the band members, supervise the band's practice, point out the flaws in the practice process, and also provide solutions.
I'm putting together the plan. the door bell.
There were no disturbing signs hanging at the door, and I didn't know if any of the artists were coming to see him at this time.
Open the door, stand a young man, and two soldiers.
He glanced at the young man wearing the golden chest.
Even though they had just come to the moon, the summons had known the level of the breastplate, and the two soldiers should have been there to protect the young man.
People with gold are in charge of their safety.
However, to the gold at such a young age, must be the most important talent, someone to protect should be.
The young man in front of him, when he saw the summon, was excited, and somewhat restrained.
"Come,Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "Come," "
Words are powerful, extremely loud, especially the last three words.
Two soldiers behind
Why don't you come and tell me what's good?
Are you too nervous to say anything wrong?
However, Yuan did not realize what he said was wrong, not even remember what just said, at this time in the brain only see the idol excitement.
"Are I disturbing you," said Yuan.
"No, come in," said the party, laughing.
"Oh, thank you," he said.
When Yuan entered, the two soldiers followed.
Yuan returned to God, and quickly explained: "Come, brother, these two are to protect my safety, according to the regulations, our gold-clad engineers go out, and need to have at least two soldiers with the protection.
It should be.
Their two soldiers also dropped two cups of water and then looked at Yuan.
In front of the idol, Yuan to show his superiority, before calling here, he will wear the medals, symbolic of the Invisible Engineer level small gold medals also shined wear well, never to the idol disgrace!
"I was born on a star, and now I am an engineer at the Institute of Engine Technology, and my parents are also an engineer at the Institute of Engine Technology, and here I am my second-generation engineer.
"Cough!"
Yuan had a head, and a soldier sitting next to him coughed, reminding him of something he could not say.
After being interrupted by Yuan, he quit talking about "important projects" and went on: "I'm pretty good anyway! As for genius, I'm the first in our institute... second, except for the little bear who came here recently, I'm the youngest gold medal engineer in our institute!"
Speaking of this, Yuan with a bit of reluctance.
Previously he was indeed the top genius of the institute, and after hitting the bear's child, he was pushed down the first throne.
"I know you're coming and I've got a big present! I've made a fleet model by myself!
I couldn't get to the meeting in the afternoon.
The lower Yuan's voice, the more embarrassing and heartbreaking a smile on his face, handing over the part the size of the nail lid.
A fleet model went to inspection, only such a small part, Yuan could not, and this was already the bottom line of inspection officer, even he the genius gold medal engineer could not break the example.
Yuan did not have any other gifts, this time not enough to prepare for time, only to send out the parts.
You'll be invisible for a while. I'll go back and make it a gift for you to get through the inspection!
"That's good.
He summoned the little part that didn't look, "It's part of the jump engine in the model?
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
Yuan wasted.
It's too hard!
As a gold engineer, it's too difficult to track stars!
I can't say it can't say it can't say it, I can't even send out the prepared gifts, I'm sorry to talk to idols!
Thinking hard how to explain Yuan, he looked up and found himself.
Smile.
Yuan, who calls attention to the above:???
Without waiting for Yuan to understand the meaning of the call, the call took out a big box handed to him.
There's a sea dragon skeleton.
?
No No No.
Yuan stretched out his hands, and Zheng came back, and looked as if he had received the Holy Spirit.
Could you please sign on the bottom of the model?
"Yeah.
The Party found a suitable pen and signed on the bottom of the model of the Sea Dragon skeleton.
Fearing to be called to rest, Yuan did not stay long, and soon resigned.
By the time Yuan went out, Yuan held the box with the sea dragon skeleton model.
Go away, Yuan red eyes.
"I'm so moved! I've sent out a spare part and I've been able to get my friend's gift!"
However, the two soldiers next to him could not feel his feelings, "According to the rules, the gifts you receive from outside must be inspected.
Let's work together.
Although the artists invited to carry the luggage has been checked again, Yuan collected the gift, still have to check again.
It's also to protect his personal safety.
Yuan wasted his face to pass the model box, "Be careful, don't break the bone, especially the bottom, but don't rub the signature!
When Yuan returned to the faculty, he did not continue his previous work, but looked at the little gifts he had just received.
Although Yuan revealed very little information, the summons can still infer from it some things.
Combining all the questions before, he had a guess.
He also remembered the words of Barbara, when she had just discovered Yao, "The dream team of the old-class expedition carries the great wisdom of that time!"
"The intelligence of that time..."
"Look at the little parts in your hand," he said softly.
Yao's team existed four hundred years ago.
Yuan just mentioned the little bear, it is very likely to have previously seen the child that seems ordinary but has a mechanical core.
Achieving Perfection in a crowd is not an ordinary AI.
At the end of the century, he had contact with many of the great scientists of that time, and he knew that every flash of human wisdom, the development of the world would take a leap.
But what are the possibilities of artificial intelligence, energy technology, space shuttles, and so on, while the new century has been built over just a hundred years by multiple flashes of intelligence?
During this period, the world, which has been devastated, will have to recover from the great disaster, urban planning will have to be rebuilt, and the new order of the Twelve will have to be formed.
"Is it a great outbreak of wisdom or..."
Their eyes were fixed on the small parts of their hands, as if they were looking through the small parts of their hands for a longer period of time.
There's another possibility.
"External."
A Star.
CHAPTER 468 I'm also a baby
What exactly is not yet confirmed by the summons.
However, it became clear that if there were an outsider, the most likely "alien", the legendary father of the revolving engine, the founder of the Planetary Fund "Starmaster", he brought too much change, and created the special status of the Planetary Fund.
I don't know what the purpose of the outsiders, and how many people, but at least now it seems that they are not hostile, and have trained many top talents.
But these are just guesses.
It also reminds him of the impact of the new world when he was first "reborn" in that small apartment on the black street.
He laughed at the little part in his hand. Put it into the box.
"The future is here."
Institute of Advanced Technology.

A child wearing a gold chest was lying on the table crying.
"Wow! You can't hold my little rich! My little rich rich!
There were tears, and weaknesses.
The red eyebrows, the trembling corners of the mouth, and sometimes the bursts, made the security guards sitting opposite the table feel guilty.
The Inspector usually expresses a single face, hard to show the color of anger.
He knew that little boy would cry.
It hurts my head.
The Inspector slowed his voice: That black ball...that what, your little rich man is undergoing inspection.
Being a gold engineer more than Yuan's genius, he was afraid to speak out.
However, as soon as the voice fell, again a great cry.
"It's been fifteen and seven seconds! Look how slow the inspection is! Is my little wealthy already experiencing uncertainty?" The child who was lying on the table did not raise his head, and the tears were heavier.
Looking at the time display on the wall, the security guard said in his mind: No wonder the gold-coat engineer can keep the time to the seconds without looking at the time display.
However, the situation is complicated and of course the inspection will take longer.
Before that Yuan's fleet model took longer.
It's only been 15 minutes.
Nearly five minutes later, the black ball was sent.
Looking at the approval sign above, the inspector hurried to hand over the black ball, and when handed over, it was also handed over.
Hand feel really good, suitable for reduction of pressure, no wonder children like.
After the bear returned to the rich, and said, And my dog eggs and dogs left! Where are they wrong! Without them I would be lonely and afraid!
"It belongs to the dangerous, and is not allowed to be carried out.
As for your safety, don't worry, we'll send people to protect you, said the security guard.
"I'll have them! My dogs and dogs are left!"
While crying, I pulled out a bottle of water from the nearby backpack, poured, and continued crying.
The Inspectors continued with their headaches, and they had advanced instructions on how to deal with the two mechanical dogs. They were indeed personal items belonging to the bear, but they were also loaded with weapons, and they needed to be handled with care.
Waiting angrily for the time, the inspector rolled in the drawer, rolled out a stick of sugar passed.
Come, eat the sugar. Don't cry.
The Bear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Attorney General
My head hurts.
Finally, in the little bear w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w w
The Inspector took a long breath and pulled out a smile she thought was kind.
"Okay," he said, "you can take your little rich and your dogs, but you have to keep to the rules when you're out."
"It's good!"
The cry stopped, and the bear jumped down from the chair, one hand holding two mechanical dogs, and the other hand holding the black ball, and went away happily.
Inspector:
Isn't this speed?
That's it!
Are all the children now so cow!
The Inspector thinks today has given him a lesson.
The little bear is very good.
It's nice to have kids!
It's easy when you're young!
The people in the lab are very tolerant of the genius kids, now on the side of the research lab to develop a new generation of jumping engines, the contribution of the little bear is very large, compared to the normal little stubborn to play the temper is small thing, so, to play the little temper everyone also let him.
However, when it comes to the development of the jumper, the bear is dissatisfied.
He hasn't been on Yao since four hundred years, hasn't been making any progress, hasn't been!
Think about the time when they had seven super smarts and one star master, and how fast they're developing, and how fast they're replacing engines, and how efficient they are, and now they can't keep flying boats!
It's a pity that four hundred years ago, the other six superintelligences were either destroyed by rebellion or failed to go to sleep, and now he's the only one who can do it.
Alas, the seven super intelligents who accompanied the Star Master!
There's only one left.
It's really exciting!
Oh no no no no no no no!
I'm the biggest!
At last the six on your head!
Something like this! Humans are so fun!
Especially here, weak and not threatening.
Like to play with these emotional species!
Whenever you feel bored, you just make a few more friends.
The Bear is still very satisfied with the present life.
After returning from Yao, his days were gone.
There is something wrong.
Why work?
I'm still a baby!
Four Hundred years ago was a baby, four hundred years after I still a baby!
The world is so beautiful, I have not played enough!
Who would come here if it wasn't for the debt?
Operations are limited, out of work has to be inspected, almost all the rich have been detained there!
You've got to get out.
The Bear glanced at the two soldiers behind, and murmured with discontent.
Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu
However, little bears only in front of strangers, and if in front of the flower giant, will deliberately sell seeds, will smoke.
Although the Master has died, the successors of the star still have the means to suppress him, such as the flower.
In the eyes of little bear is a great devil, do not move to work overtime!
It's not just borrowing some money to buy music rights, it's throwing him out all around this crazy place?!
Look like he's a kid.
The Bear continues to be.
I like this group of weak people to the attitude of the minor to him, to avoid many things.
Nobody here knows his real age, except the top of the Hidden Star and some of the core managers of the Planetary Fund.
Hi Hi
With that thought, the bear was happy again.
Work,,,,,,,,,!
The Bear wondered what reason to go out on the beach, and took the dog on a little walk to the inn.
He's going to find a way to play.
As soon as we heard of the call, the artists invited to the Invisible Art Festival have arrived today.
He knows his deep, and his temper is good, so the bear is glad to have more contact with him.
At least in front of the summons he can sell moo as he likes without having to worry about being beaten by the summons.
Last time I heard him watch Creation watch cry, the party reminded him to drink more.
What a good man!
The reception manager knew the bear, too identifiable, the child in the golden coat with two mechanical dogs, the whole hidden star is one.
Besides, the little bear just came to the star and stayed here for two days, everyone was impressed.
However, due to the gold medal engineer level, normally people don't call him "the little bear" or "the bear master", "the bear teacher", or "the bear master", but the play is called "the little bear".
Everyone is tolerant of such high-tech talents.
After all, he's still a child!
See the bear come, hear him to call, the reception manager personally brought him upstairs to find someone.
As he got into the elevator, the bear took out a stick of sugar and handed it to the pipe.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
The Goldman's head is not touch.
It's a respect for high talent!
The Room.
Watching the game channels live on the stadium, the ears moving, licking licking nose, the vision hard to move from the television screen, turning to the door, then pouring the mouth water to go down to the side of the door, the clear dog eyes close to the door.
Revisions to the score also point to the closed door.
on the other side of the door.
The little bear got closer, but the closer the door, the slower the pace.
The red face just turned pale, a drop of sweat came out.
Stop.
He wasted an important thing before.
Now, remember.
In the hands of the little rich, once again assembled a perfect circle.
When the bear stopped suddenly, ther said, The summoned room is just in front, and less than five meters away.
"No, I don't think this is a good time, or not to disturb.
The Bear shook his head and did not step forward.
Finding that little bear's face is not more than sweating, the plumber panic, this genius can never happen!
Isn't it uncomfortable?I'll send you downstairs to the doctor!
"No, no, I just thought of an important thing, I'll go first!
"Evil" took the dog and turned away.
Running out of the reception, the little bear wiped his sweat, brushed a bottle of water with a staff card, and poured a whole bottle.
It's awful to get water today.
Looking back at the dogs and dogs that seemed unknown to the crisis, the bear regretted, "I made these two wands for my wages!
CHAPTER 45
"It's really simple," said one of the other magicians, who couldn't help laughing.
"Well," said Lin, nodding.
He needed the fastest to find other pieces, originally he intended to conquer more evil spirits, get more pure soul power.
But now that opportunity, the fastest to get in the hands is the king way.
Shortly afterwards, the Master led Lam to an evil gate.
Both hands gently touch the evil door frame, close the eyes.
Therapist quickly began to construct a space base as a coordinate.
Following the ritual fluctuation of the evil spirit gate, carrying the consciousness of Linming, together the ritual fluctuation is launched out.
"The ordinary transmission ceremony is a point-to-point orientation transmission."
"But we usually explore other space secrets by turning these points into multiple points.
This can only be done on the transmission disk, modifying little parameters.
On the one hand, the master guides the consciousness of Lin, on the other hand, teaches the related techniques.
"In this way, the Devil Gate will spontaneously transmit our consciousness to the possibilities of a number of similar target spaces.
It's just a matter of energy, luck, we can hit the space secret we want, bad luck, we'll have to waste energy a few more times.
"It's really random.
Lin is silent.
As soon as his sense entered the demon gate, he was immediately fluctuated by the ritual, wrapped and sent out.
At the same time, he felt as if consciousness had been divided into more than ten, and at the same time felt more than ten completely different spaces.
"In general, our consciousness is difficult to maintain in the course of transmission, so we can only remember as much as possible the spatial coordinates that the primary consciousness touches.
The memory of coordinates requires us to leave a simple mark.
Outside, therapist explains in a low voice, while guiding Linmer, teaching him how to create a simple marker, thus determining the coordinate code.
But he didn't realize that the conscious soul of Lin was too strong and tough to remember the coordinates of more than ten conscious spaces after being separated.
But it's more than one heart. That's nothing for the soul consciousness can use one heart N. He's every day practicing the techniques of one heart dozens.
He can control observation by means of split consciousness. So now he can control many calls at the same time independently, although he can not do it alone.
But just to remember the fluctuation of the breath, and set the coordinates separately.
In addition to his own soul is tougher than the common man, exists longer.
It's still very easy.
Ten minutes later. consciousness is exhausted. scattered.
Lin opened his eyes and looked at some of the masters.
Give me the location of this coordinate.
He immediately said one of the special space secret coordinates under the eye of the master and others.
The secret of this coordinate is the special space that Lin was aware of, has with him the same source of the rotation of the evil circle.
Is It Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success Success
"It's a simple operation.
Let's start building delivery gates.
I'll go, said Lin.
"Yes."
"Wait for the body. " "The soul of the Heavenly worker," said Lin, "is slowing down."
"What?" he asked as the Master and others began to move material resources, and as he waited by the side, he exchanged voices with the angel in his mind.
There's a lot more going on this side than there is on the other side of the island.
This is a sign that Linz never saw.
Knowing that even when he had the existence of the night king told the worker of the night, never saw her so serious.
It made him feel a little nervous.
"The moon should be in absolute weakness," said Lin.
Or is there a new force?
"No, it's not a new force," said Xiang.
Instead, the moon has deceived everyone!
What's the matter?
"The seven locks have already been summoned successfully, the moon has deceived all of the three secrets, he has already been summoned successfully, and he has used himself as a sacrifice!
Lin suddenly lost consciousness.
"As a sacrifice?"
That's crazy!
So now the three secrets facing are the mixed monsters of the moon and Frodo....
Lin is not right.
"What should we do now?" said the Astronaut.
Forward combines the moon, and the overlap of the two is not so simple as one plus one equals two, but three times ten.
"Don't get excited.
Their biggest enemy was the Three Secrets and many other great powers.
And the world isn't as simple as you think.
Lin thought of the information that had been investigated before.
"The Star Pond, and those who hold sacred things, aren't simple characters.
As long as he doesn't draw us, we too are lazy to take care of how they develop.
"I understand what you mean.
But it's better to get ready, she reminded.
"I had that level of destructive power at the time when I was controlled by the sword.
So I know what the power of that level will lead to.
Lin.
Among all his rulers, He was one of the most special, because He was once controlled by a special and powerful existence.
At that time, even in the back of the memory, had noticed the sight of Lin.
It's just an image of a memory, but it's also found to peer into the memory.
It's so powerful that's beyond Linz's understanding.
"I know," replied Lin.
"I'll be ready.
Take it easy.
It is not possible to open the most powerful kind of special state, summon all the commanding powers, melt into itself.
Cutting off the connection with the work, Lin stared quietly at the new evil door just built.
"It's open," said the Master in a low voice.
Lin stared at the door, quietly.
"Let the fairy king come" "And," "Degar!"
"Here."
The Guardian is already near.
Hearing the call, he entered from the door.
"Lord, listen to your command."
Lin raised his head.
"I'm going to open several transmissions at the same time and explore many evil spaces."
"You've chosen a hundred great demons, and you've divided them into teams of different sizes, and you've divided them into exploratory teams.
"Follow me," said DeCarl, with a clear heart, "I'm afraid that's what's happened to him."
Otherwise there will be no sudden and urgent large-scale hands-on exploration.
Chapter 456
Follow Lin's instructions to explore the secret worlds.
After Degar's command, he quickly went down and ordered the army.
On the other hand, the magicians sent a message to the emperor, and began to summon the troops.
Soon, the Prince, with a number of sharp messengers, crossed out of one of the demon gates.
"What do you say, Lord?"
The perfect burst, but the face of only one eye of contradiction, bowed up to Lin's face.
"I'm going to send a slave army to explore new space secrets.
How to find the fastest, you arrange, I just want the result.
The Empire can't be so rough on the side of the demons.
Their Empire has become more and more a community of the combination of the demons and humans.
Their feelings and attachments are deeper, and the tasks are given to them, as long as the result is the best.
"Belong," said the fairy.
She certainly had more ways to explore new spaces as harmless as possible.
Require the Good Fairy King and the Magician. Soon, Linming constantly senses the secret of the new space, constantly looking for the space that might have a fracture breath.
Perceive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One after another transmission door was constantly opened on this square.
Time passes slowly.
A large army of evil spirits and the army of the evil empire have been drawn out.
They were first sent here, and then turned to other secrets.
A lot of the transport resources are consumed and a variety of materials are used as consumables.
As a result, there are more than a million sources constantly evil spirits and demons army, pulling out into each open transmission gate.
A few days later.
Some of these gates have been removed because of the discovery process, and some have been left behind because of the abundance of resources, or the existence of research value, etc.
When it was determined that was a fracture, Lin had found three.
All three, he dispatched a large army to investigate carefully.
Their feedback indicates that the opposite is a relatively wide and comprehensive space with intelligent life and living activities.
Lin thought, this treasure of the gods level, let his subordinates find, and not restless.
If you find yourself swallowed, that's really bad.
So thinking for a moment, he decided to have people look at the space information environment there, and then go in himself. quickly to find the fragments, get it, and go.
B C D D D D D D D D D D D D
"Look at me."
Jupiter, or rather Frodo, raised his head, and on his back grew an enormous number of grey tentacles, which were woven into a huge face.
Hundreds of red beads were scattered over the face of the man.The beads stared deeply at the array of names in front of him.
Boom!
An invisible fluctuation follows some mysterious channel, instantly crossing over a thousand meters, accurately falling on the lines of people who are madly fleeing.
"No!"
One screamed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Come on!
Suddenly, the head of a family from the fire of Hell, the body like a flower, whispered, cut in pieces, fell down, fell into the sea.
Several other witnesses quickly escaped without saying a word.
It's not enough for them to overcome. How many more are going to die.
Frodo was already on the higher horizon of the order, and if there were no powers of the same horizon, they would also be put to death.
"Black Hand."
With one mouth, a black ink-shaped arm suddenly stretched out from his mouth, and caught up with the few who had escaped.
P P P!
Two rows like slaughtered lambs, gently two cries, and the blood flows down, falling into the sea.
Blood and bodies were scattered all over the island of Bisca.
The ultimate power of a sequence, which causes death, destroys the island.
The whole island was blown up by several layers of soil, and the altitude dropped by more than ten meters.
Frodo stepped on the white flag of the tower on the ground and looked at the tower's strongest, the white-winged man and the two red angels, whom he had taken alive.
"It's a pity.
I won in the end.
His face was almost decayed, with an unknown smile.
"You think...you...
A long way, on a raised rock, there was an old man nailed to the top, who was full of blood.
"You're not dead yet?" said Frodo, looking at the old man.
West West West West West West West West West West
He fused the memories of the moon, in fact, a group of people between the moon and Frodo.
Nature leaves a personality and emotions.
In fact, he is not the full body, but the representative.
"Oh.
This time I lost...but the world isn't as simple as you think.
Wait, someone will get revenge for me.
Hold on.
The old man looked cold.
"I'm looking forward.
Frodo grabbed, and at the same time automatically concocted a huge gray arm, grabbed the old man, grabbed.
P P P
Ash splashed into his hands.
"It's a pity.
My old friend is a little.
' said Frodo, with a false sigh.
On the ground around him, the array of fires of Hell made not even a complete corpse.
Just as he was pretending to mourn, an invisible, silent, silvery spike flew from behind him, hitting him directly on the back.
With sharp hands, is the strongest of the white paper, the crown of the star Kasa.
His face was pale, and he was clearly injured in the confusion just now.
Originally he had succeeded in hiding himself, but at this moment, the whole of the island of Biscay, all under the powerful red circle force.
Once it hits the edge of the force field, it will immediately be revealed.
With his strength at this time, under the full, the top can hardly take a blow with the hand of Falludor.
If you can't hide, then you will surely die.
So he had to come back. The server was looking for an opportunity.
"Storm"
Just a stab, injured or not, can make the soul of a living organism shake and convulse for a day.
Star Casta's hair is tough, and knows that if it doesn't stop for a short time, he won't be able to escape safely from here.
Instead of sitting and dying, take action against Go!
His rank makes thermal breath and the fluctuation of life.
This ability allows him to hide himself in another invisible space.
It was only in the moment of attack, and it was one of the most powerful of the crown.
The silver pointed a little closer to Frodo's back.
Five.
Three.
Two.
One meter.
The sharps accelerated, to the front.
Curse!
Frodo suddenly spoke.
Come on!
A circle of pure grey vibrations spread from his whole body to all sides.
Chapter 45
The wave, with a tremendous sense of vibration, almost in a moment, pushed away the star vibration behind Frodo.
"The curse is tough."
"The Curse"..
"A curse of suffocation."
"The High Death".
Higher Death.
"The most fortified edge of the ultimate flame."
As a series of magical words exploded, a large number of colored lights flashed on him.
At the same time, a series of magical effects exploded on the star.
bound,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A series of high powers, originally required to prepare for at least one day of great power, are in the hands of Frodo like ordinary tricks, light and easy to pass by voice and speech.
Until the star returns to God, he only resists and counteracts the two magical effects, the rest of which can no longer be done.A layer of magical effects wraps him perfectly bound, into an irresistible gray and black big dough.
P P P
Without saying anything, Frodo stretched his right hand forward and pierced the star's eyebrows.
His hands were like sharp knives, light and easy to strike into the bone of the star, stirring his brain.
Come on!
At the moment of the star's death, as the enemy, the huge energy gathered in his body, suddenly exploded, turned into a mass of hot fire, abruptly surrounded by Frodo.
Soon the red flame washed away, revealing the fleeting figure of Frodo.
He lifted his eyes up to the many warships that were fleeing rapidly.
Next, just by opening three different Paths, I will be able to come back completely and the hands of the Pluto will be able to recover in advance.
Fight and let me feel more surprise.
Otherwise, having been bored for so many years, it would not be easy to come out once, wouldn't it be too boring?
Frodo took a step and read the words of the magic in his mouth.
"The curse of God."
Come on!
His body instantly turned into a gray light, like a meteor flying out into the warship.
Unknown.
On the blurred white snow fields, thousands of evil spirits, are fighting mad and opposite half man horses.
The blood of half a horse red the original pure white snow.
Their natural physical immunity allows them to only be injured by a small amount of energy.
Only a third of the army of half men possess such a weapon of energy.
And this is already the top power of this secret world.
Lin was riding a giant war horse, a heavy white armour, standing quietly on a hill, overlooking the battlefield below.
His face was covered with a mask, and he could not see any expression, except in his eyes, which revealed his coldness and indifference.
Have you found what I want? he asked suddenly.
"I found," said the tail chief, "and hung him secretly on the other's ankle, which I found, and took off immediately."
The King of the Fairy suddenly emerged, kneeling on the right side of Linming.
At the same time she held a piece of white gold like a ghost's face, and a strange bone like a symbol.
The bone is only about the size of the palm, is arc shaped, has the surface of silk-small cracks, seems to have suffered severe damage.
Lin raised his hand and felt the above like a heart.
That's it.
He grabbed his bones and finally looked at the half-man tribe that was fighting.
The Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min Min
"Let them surrender, and let those who don't want to be disposed of," Lin said at last, and turned and rode away.
The remaining princes knee- knee- knee- knee-- knee-- knee.
In Just Four Days.
Lin has been running through ten different secret spaces.
These spaces are large and small, big feet are a mega area, and a small top is more than a city such as Trinidad and Tobago.
But there are not few who are hidden.
Among the most resistant was the immediate Ma secret, which was ruled by the half-Ma tribe.
These white grasslands are ruled by this powerful tribe.
They've been enemies for too long, they've forgotten how to treat people who are stronger than themselves, they've got no respect whatsoever.
Consequently, when the envoys under Linming arrived here, the conflicts and conflicts thus began.
After Lin's envoys were mercilessly decapitated, the great army of evil spirits, under Lin's orders, gathered together, and rushed madly into the secrets of the snowy prairie.
The arrogant tribe finally tasted the disastrous fruit.
And the price is almost exterminated.
Two days later, from the strongest of the Moor tribes, the king of horses, Kur the spear, dark but full of sorrow, in the palace of the devils, worshipped the devil king Lin, who sits at the end of the throne.
His tribes were slaughtered, and only one branch of blood was supported.
Under such circumstances, he who was only most enthusiastic about the practice of fighting, had to take on a heavy duty at a time of danger, achieve a new king, at the expense of joining Lin盛's command, in exchange for forgiveness to the people of the Ma.
Like the Fairy King, in order to protect the last blood and legacy of the group, he had to commit to the full, joining Linming's command, becoming one of his claws.
From then on, under Lin, there were the Prince of Fairies, the Prince of Horses, and the Prince of Dragons, the three chiefs of the army.
They represent the power of three different ethnic groups.
Among them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's in real time when Lin's warriors are scraping the pieces of the evil circle.
Frodo also really did a great tragedy to the world.
After defeating and killing most of the envoys, Mai, or rather Frodo, pursued the United Fleets of the World and carried out an appalling massacre.
And he's not just a killer.
Instead, with the use of a wide range of sinking spells, a total of 18 warships, a total of more than 30,000, all frozen and sank in the ocean near the island of Biska.
These frozen soldiers did not die, but were confined to their bodies, and the spirit was born to sink into the sea, and gradually became insane in the endless silence and death.
Come on!
Above the blue sea, a half-gray smoke figure appeared behind Frodo, raising his right arm and grasping the huge long-line missile that fell from the sky.
A white intercontinental missile, constantly emitting enormous high-temperature orange flames, with unimaginable power, attempts to hit the gray humanoid's head.
At the same time, the top of the missile is embedded with a large green crystal.
A large quantity of the e e e e e e e f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f
But it doesn't help.
Frodo uses force.
G G.
More than ten meters long white intercontinental missiles, like a pile of waste iron, twisted into a pile in his hand.
All the liquid powder leaped out of it and spread over the sea without any sign of explosion or burning.
Chapter 45
Come on!
In the midst of the thunder, the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of the thunders of
"The curse reflects."
Frodo raised his hand.
A huge square grey barrier suddenly appeared in front of him.
There is a large lion's head in the middle of the screen.
All the ends of maggots are fused with the male's head.
Come on!
For a moment, all of the evil cannons hit the screen, then paused for a moment, and suddenly rebounded.
All the shots were shot back in the direction they were flying.
Come on!
There was a sound of explosion on the far side of the sea, and there was a loud cry of anger from the wicked.
Frodo looked far at the direction of the shot.
"The nearest place is Redon.
Then go to heaven.
With a smile on his face, his feet slightly, suddenly the sea exploded, turned into a huge whirlwind, and moved rapidly.
For a moment, Frodo did not know when to disappear from the place.
The Palace.
Knock.
Linming gently placed the white bone on the black crystal.
Something wonderful happened.
The white gold bone is a spontaneous change of shape, very tightly attached to the black crystal column.
And at the same time crystal columns slowly deform, from coarse to thin, and the edges gradually evolve into thin and thin blades.
In less than ten seconds, this crude black crystal column has been transformed into a two-meter long, thick black knife.
The knife handle is made of white gold bone, the blade is painted black without light, and is extremely rough. The overall appearance looks, is the most common type of thick-backed knife.
Lin raised his hand to hold the knife.
Hum.
The knife shivered sharply and sounded like a fork.
"Are the two pieces merged to reveal the body gradually?"
In the gray palace, Lin touched gently, the weapon that fused the shade of the evil circle.
He could feel that was not the nature of the evil circle.
"According to the absence of thermal fluctuations on the upper side, there are at least two pieces left to rebuild the complete rotating circle.
Lin raised a big knife, lying in front of him, holding hands.
There's another piece, and it feels like it's able to activate its initial powers.
The Ring is one of the most powerful deities in the world of the devils, and the holder is able to control the whole world of the devils.
Although Lin did not believe that the holder could claim all the legends, the turn of the evil circle is said to have many kinds of evil demonic powers, or to be out-sweeping.
He sat on his seat, rubbing gently the big knife in his hand, feeling carefully the mysterious and hidden power that flowed within.
Come on come on come on come on come on come on.
I've already determined the secret world where the third piece is.
Lin's face is calm, but in the heart is outside expectation.
At this time, the King and the Fairy King, have gone to the third fragment world, conquering this most difficult wide space.
Lin was quietly waiting for the good news to come.
There should be little problem with a secret world, which is made up of two orders of people, a horse king and a fairy king.
Just before he studied carefully the fused sword in his hand, a commanding officer led a soldier of the evil spirit who was half dead into the palace.
It's all wrong!
The Commander washed his face and handed over a black roll to Lin.
Lin took over the roll, a slight shake, suddenly the roll exploded, turned into countless green light points.
"Is it the magician's technique?"
His eyebrows shrinked, and this long-distance filming scroll is precious, able to passively record a lot of critical information.
Generally, only when the holder is severely injured, will automatically start and record the key moment of the time.
He didn't know what had to happen. But since the filming was started, there must have been a strong enemy.
Soon, the scattered light points converge to form a triangular screen.
The screen begins slowly showing the events that have occurred before.
In a vast white column, a tall black giant with a golden arm, is roaring and fighting with the fairy king.
The Black Giant wears a very strong black metal back, each punch one foot, have a great shaking power explode.
The ground of the main hall is constantly thrown into pits.
As time passed, the fairy was slowly falling into the wind.
On the other side, the king of horses had a huge spear, and a white-skinned giant underneath and a human tail shook hard.
The King has fallen into a state of frenzy, which is a state of exaggeration of his fighting power all the time.
He was twice the size of the human race, and at this time he was almost five meters tall and three meters wide.
It's like a big meat mountain.
But the king's opponents are equally inconsiderable.
The white giant with a fish tail, equal to the height of four meters. Each wave of three forks, brings with it a fierce tornado.
The Grey Dragon was continuously bombarding the King of the Horses, disturbing his defensive action. It greatly suppressed the power of the King of the Horses to erupt.
"When conquering the secret world you ordered, the two commanders found the giant palace.
There are two giant kings who rule the whole secret.
The messenger was a semi-transparent evil spirit, and at this moment he was quietly describing.
The Giant?
Linming gently rubbed the handle of the big knife, and began to whisper.
"Yes," replied the Devil, "when translated by the devils there, the natives there indeed call them the giant twins."
That means that also belongs to the evil spirit world?
Lin washed up.
"Yes."
Lin, silent for a moment, lifted the big knife.
He took a slow step out of the palace and came to the delivery area in front of the gate.
Most of the transmission gates have been replaced by the guardian of the devil under the command of the devil.
Only the unconqued secrets are still guarded by the Space Wizards of the Fairy Empire.
Ha Ha
As soon as I reached this empty ground, in the last of the transmission gates, suddenly scurried out a graceful shadow.
He is a fairy who wears a broken green armor.
As soon as she walked out of the carriage, her body distorted, and she almost fell to the ground.
There was a spaceman who helped her.
His Majesty!
A group of the magicians rushed forward.
Unlike other demonic groups, they have a very high sense of belonging and identity to their own ruling demon king.
Lin raised his hand.
Suddenly a white sacred power became a beam of light, surrounded the queen of fairies. began to quickly treat her wound.
Only then did he notice that the right arm of the fairy had been torn apart, leaving only a bare bloody mouth.
"My lord...
There is a load under...
The Prince facelessly kneed to Lin.
Lin looked at her, and did not speak.
No matter whether or not the fairy is truly able, at least her wound, has been indisputable, and it is not good to punish him again.
After a moment of silence.
In the next door, Suddenly out of the red hair of the worker.
You go with me.
He looked at the worker.
"All right.
The Two One After, passing from the side of the Fairy King, step in the forwarding door.
At the same time entered, and followed by the guardian of evil spirits and higher evil spirits such as the Decar.
Their guards, if they do not follow, then what will happen, no one can foresee.
CHAPTER 459
The Giant.
Oh Oh Oh!
King of the Horse roaring a spear on the weapon of the opposite giant of the Fish.
Behind the giant of the human had condensed into a larger wind dragon, the gray dragon forming a strong pull, like a thread, continuing from all sides to hold the king of the human horse.
"Burn the Sword!"
The king of horses suddenly turned from pure black to white and silver.
Come on!
This stab was once again blocked by the three forks of the fish giant.
Both the power and the speed of the spear were severely disturbed by the drag of the tornado and became slower and slower.
The King wanted to retreat several times, but not far from the eyes of another Black Giant King, he did not dare any sign of retreat.
The Black Giant He remembered being at war with the Fairy King, but he didn't realize that he had come this way from the war.
It's clear that fairy is either defeated or fled.
Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death Death
So his actual fighting power is like the best of the horse kings of the past.
At this moment, the madness of the heart like the flame of the bear rolling, the power and speed of the horse king almost doubled the normal.
It's just a giant who's pushing.
But whenever he made a big move to slow down time, he was immediately threatened by the other black giant with his eyes, making him unable to accumulate.
This sadness had endured for two or three minutes.The King of the Horses had felt his anger slowly dissipating.
Wrath can indeed greatly increase speed and strength, but at such a cost as to consume very quickly his own strength and spirit, and to consume proportionally.
No! I have to find a rotor!
The Horse King, while waving the giant spear against the opponent, while sneaking around, looking for the opportunity to escape.
He brought with him a great army of evil spirits, which at this time had been thoroughly swept away by the barbarians in the kingdom of the giants.
These fierce barbarians were dressed in rough styles of feathers and armor, not with a hammer but with a giant bone knife in their hands.
Each time they wave their weapons, they shout, and a strange amount of vibration erupted.
It's as powerful as the black giant. It's amazing how it can break things inside through the surface.
The demons were shaken by this force, were found to the core of the body, and thus were removed one by one.
If it goes on, I'll die here!
But no matter what he did, the giants in front of him stuck to him.
He retreated, and the other went forward.
As he moved forward, the other side retreated.
The two giants seem to be exhausting his strength, wanting to take him without harm.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Their hearts were filled with madness.
But the flame is strong, the body burns so long, but is increasingly unable to bear the load.
"You bitches! Think you can kill me like this?
Kill the Great King Cur Cur Cur Cur Cur
"I'll let you know that's what I'm playing for!"
A sharp wind sweeps through the large spear, cutting off all of the tensile wire that the dragon scatters across.
He retreated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's a powerful martial art that requires a lifetime of burning.
He is able to restore his state to the best in a very short time, at the same time in each of his attacks, can produce a blood shield to help himself resist damage.
But at the end of the day, he refused to use this magic.
Because it takes a third of its life.
Not according to a fixed quantity, but according to a proportional consumption.
Just as hesitted in his mind, the giant saw a gap for him to walk, and waved forward three sharpeners, flashing like lightning.
Come on!
Horse King's chest suddenly prevented, was cut a large blood mouth.
He's just back, and his opponent isn't any better than his predecessor, but he's at the same level, and it takes at least a hundred moves to distinguish the winning opponent.
"Foreigners, this is not where you should come.
Now that's come, let's bury it here, and be a dead man under my two brothers.
It's a glorious home for you.
The Giant speaks in a way that is unusual, seems to have ancient rhythm, and seems to have not spoken for a long time, but suddenly began to speak with a voice.
Horse King breathed in the air, blood flowing rapidly, for him to try hard to eliminate the tiredness and decay of the body.
But once a swinging spear brings a huge burden on his body and makes him more and more difficult to recover.
"No... how can I fall here! How can I!?
The King finally made a decision, ready to use the secret of burning blood, finally crazy one.
"I'm here to help you!"
Just then, the black giant on the side of the battle jumped into the battlefield, the right hand suddenly expanded in half the air, bringing a huge shock to the horse king.
Oh Oh!
Around a large number of arms coarse black metal attacking the castle, accurate and stable bearing strange distortion of light, blowing to the horse king.
His enormous body was a huge target at the time.
At this moment he could not even begin the burning of the secret of blood, the black giant, the man-fish giant, and the giant attacking the city which had been bombed all round, all the attacks coming together at this moment.
Thermal Examination requires a moment of physical adaptation, but now he has no time for even that moment.
"No!"
He opened his eyes to see the black giant's huge fists from top to bottom.
At this point, the giant put his spear in place, and he couldn't get out of his hand to deal with the attack.
She'll die!
"I"ll" "I"ll""
At this moment everything seemed to be slowing down.
Flying.
The Black Giant.
The Three Forks.
There is a circle of semi-transparent magic around it. It is the hands of the giant who are using magic to bind themselves.
Time seemed to stop.
The King can't move, except his mind can move, his body can't move either.
Everything's like a frozen bug in amber.
Am I going to die?
He looked at the strange scene in front of him.
This is the only thing he has seen in his life. He has heard that when a man dies, he is confronted with all sorts of unthinkable things.
Perhaps it was at this moment, but what made him uncomfortable was that he seemed to be able to see the horror in the eyes of the black giant, who had no other than himself.
There's a twist on the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the face of the giant.
"It's a cold sword."
Did you see it?
This is one of the highest meanings of my swordsmanship, which is called to be able to instantly extinguish all frozen sword.
"The so-called sword," which does not have a sheath, "is capable of feeling the threat of sharpness and sharpness.
And my swords, have been able to force the soul into a frozen, instant death.
"When life thinks it's dead, it will fade."
Chapter 450
The King looked, and suddenly his eyes shrinked.
He saw a woman with red hair standing quietly behind the giants of men and the giants of darkness.
She leaned on the pillars of the palace, and stared quietly at them.
There's no weapon in the hand, it's just like holding something.
She had nothing in her hands, but she felt like she was holding a sword in her right hand.
"Listen to me," he said.
That's what swords mean.
King looked at the woman with red hair, and watched her slowly raise her hand, gently forward, to the next cut.
Immediately afterwards he saw a bloody crack clearly appearing on King Black's right shoulder.
Ha!
A large splashed out and fell on the ground.
It's not time it's us
"The Black Giant" cried, kneeling to the ground in a panic.
"Because you are too weak," said the woman with red hair.
Come on!
The door of the palace was pushed.
A giant with white armor, walked into the door, and saw neither the giant king nor the horse king.
Instead of passing between them, the pen went straight to the highest throne of giants, and turned to sit down.
It was obvious that head did not correspond to the giant throne, but at this moment, the shadow of the man sitting on it, gave the man an unspeakable repression and pressure.
I give you only one chance.
"Obey, or die."
The People on the throne
"This palace was built on the highest mountain of the evil world, on the top of the Mount of the Sands, surrounded by ice and snow.
Nice location.
It's just for us.
The Red Woman laughed.
"What do you do with these garbages? "It's no good living with them. "It's better to kill them.
Hearing the words of the giant and the black giant, the man and the black giant stirred their bodies madly, seeking to escape the magical frozen power.
"No.
It's impossible
Want me to?
Don't insult me! I'm the giant!
The Black Giant's whole muscles were rapidly inflated and cried out.
His black fist began to grow innumerable lines like black smoke.
All the wire wrapped his fist, and he quickly put on a black metal armor.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The giant fist shot like a missile, and then stood in front of the worker's face, less than half a meter.
Come on!
A strong wind blew her hair back and forth, but her fist could not move more than one inch.
"Well, now you've proved you're not a garbage.
A gleamed in the worker's eyes.
"A man who can escape from my sword will never be a full-time man!
I acknowledge your bravery.
The Black Giant opened his mouth and couldn't make any sound.
This distance even deprived him of the right to roar.
Did you feel it?
There was a kind of awkward laugh.
This is my sword.
She stretched out her delicate fingers slightly on the black giant's forehead.
"Your blood."
It's too noisy.
It's...
As one finger pointed out, the blood flow on the black giant began to slow down rapidly, decrease, and then slower and slower.
Less than a few seconds later, he was forced into a blood stagnation.
"Do you know anything that never makes a sound?
Sha's fingers turned into hands, gently touching the face of the black giant.
Only death will never make a sound.
"That's enough," she said.
Finally there was a cold voice on the throne.
Xia smiled back.
"I'm not joking with him," he said, "but he's hard enough to tear off one of his sister's arms.
I just want to give him a little lesson.
"The King's arm can be taken back.
Don't worry about it.
All right, then, follow your orders, the Holy.
Xia smiled back again, and the depressed and heavy fear of the side, also in her smile back, slowly dissipated.
All the noise of stagnation came back again.
As soon as the black giant fell, even though it took a little time, it was that time that the king of the black giant completely lost his power.
His whole blood was forced tos, to cover up the result, so that his whole skill in many places suffered from unspeakable negative effects.
Lincoln sat on the throne of the giant and looked down.
Both were stiff and were frightened by the worker's birth of the giant king stuck in the ground.
There are others who have been shaken as well.
Being able to enter here from outside in a bad environment, is in life force and power, sufficiently powerful living spirits.
This is why Linz plans to give the Giant twins a chance.
He needs more troops, more powerfuls, to conquer more evil worlds.
Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big
But his brother can get rid of the sword, does not mean that he does.
The Fish Giant struggled madly, trying to open the invisible bounds around.
But he's much stronger than his brother.
If the power of the black giant is equal to the power to the extreme of the order of power. and the three secret order of power.
Then he was only like the general general; and the general general, more than himself, went and studied, than the secret general of the college; and the general general, more than himself, went and studied.
Whether it's power or it's natural power field, and the human fish giant belongs to this level.
This is the worst level in the order.
Unless his brother is good, Lin is too lazy to take the power of the unspeakable guy.
Their struggles and their pains made the Great Hall seem to be in a sad state.
"It's a cloud," said Lin, softly.
Oh.
There was a lot of pressure on the giant, and suddenly it was light.
The two giants trembled at first, then they jumped at the same time, flashing toward the gate of the palace.
The Black Giant was still in the midst of the air.
His punch was so heavy that, as soon as it fell, the air cried out in mourning, and the punch was bent like a great wave of water, and struck at the speed of Lin.
This circle is a shock wave created purely by the shock of force.
On the surface it looks like a natural shock.
But in fact it's a full blow of the black giant's own training shaking power.
If anyone really sees the twist as a normal wave, then it's dead.
Lin looked at the vibration wave distorted the speed reach.
He stopped the worker who was about to come out, but he stretched out his left hand, standing in front of him.
Standing hands in front of the vibrating wave.
CHAPTER 461
P P P
There was a light.
Shock wave twist force is crushed flat, wanting to break Lindsay's hand.
But it is evident that hand is less than one tenth of its weight; but it is dead that holds it in the midst of the air.
Soon, the invisible shaking twisted everywhere, washed away by the hard living on the left hand of Lin.
This shock twist, like a real shock wave, is handled by Linming naturally.
Looking back, the black giant's heart cold.
That's another top-not-the-bottom-power.
Seeing the moment, even he himself began to doubt, is the hand that he just waved, is really just a hand wave?
Unless he's missing most of his shaking energy, that's just a punch that really works.
I'm afraid he's already doubting life.
"What?
How is that possible?
The Giant saw the scene, too, and wondered whether the brother had forgotten to use force.
The king of horses, who had come again from God, had blocked the gate of the great house, and had blocked the way of the two men that departed.
At this time, in the swords of the Heavenly Workers, they are the two giant kings who are free from the restrictions of activity, except the people of the sanctuary.
Many of the remaining giant warriors, still like amber, stand on the ground, not moving, maintaining their original position.
Give me back!
A spear stopped the two giants.
Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man Man
Just a second before he was like a dead dog ready to fight and fight.
At this moment, the elder and the worker came, instantly the situation reversed.
The soon-dead dog instantly become strong, blocked the door, standing high staring at two confused giant kings.
"Are you crazy?
Are you going to kill me?
At this moment the whole heart through a kind of refreshment.
It was at this time that he felt that there was a big guy behind the mountain.
Especially when you follow a very good big guy, looking just can beat yourself to the dead dog, in the blink of an eye to be beat yourself to the dead dog.
This refreshing feeling is hard to describe!
The King hit the right cheek of the Black Giant King.
There was a great sound, and the king of the black giant was blown up, and rolled back, and fell down in the middle of the palace.
It just landed in front of Lin.
Looking at the Black Giant, he couldn't do anything like that, but he felt a refreshment from the spinal cord straight up to his spinal cord and then up to the back of the spoon.
"Isn't he cool?"
The King laughed, this moment of loyalty to the Holy One, it was a rush upwards.
He laughed so well, and the giants and the two kings were so sad to breathe blood.
The King, who had just been defeated by them, at a glance, was able to shine before them, and to force the face.
The two giant kings looked at the ugly boastful face of the man horse king, the heart of a kind of evil fire went out.
Looking at the face, there is an impulse to kill the king of horses.
Don't you still obey? Don't you have a hard bone?
It doesn't matter, but my old horse likes the hard-headed guy.
Hey!
He laughed and took up his spear, clapping his hands toward the two giant kings.
Isn't that old horse
What did you learn by following the King?
Lin smiled at the worker.
When he's not, it's up to him to coordinate the whole thing.
Horse King is only confused with the stronger than himself. so the most obey the Heavenly Worker.
Initially, Linsen had the Emperor Xia teach some of the military's commanders about the realities.
It's a kind of popular science.
It just looks like this effect.
Watching two giant kings struggle on the ground like a little daughter, terrified to avoid the ever-closer king of horses.
Lin must have a kind of impulse to cover his face.
Where did he go?
He came to take over two rows, not to see the minors banned from watching the little broadcast.
"You don't give up!"
There was a great laugh from the king of horses.
"You kill me!Your father I will not give up!
No No No
Come on! Come on!
The Black Giant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Without surrendering, he and his brother were afraid of being stripped by the king of horses.
There were so many hands on the scene, and so many of their own children.
It would be a disgrace if you were to be stripped of light and hanged on a stick! Even if you die, you will be remembered for 10,000 years!
Don't even say that's a good thing.
Look at the next two giants look at the Man King, want to kill him with eyes.
Lin shouldn't think about getting King to try to force him to serve a full sentence?
Maybe punishing one is better for him than fighting.
In order to maintain their image, finally under the shame of the King of Horses, surrendered under the command of Linming. succeeded in joining the great army of the King of Evil, became the two generals under his hand.
The Power of the Spirit is further, becomes more powerful, expands.
After conquering the Queen of the Giants, Linz finally found the fall of the third fragment in the king's palace.
In the giant treasure, the debris, in the form of a crystal ball, lay quietly deep in the treasure treasure, for a thousand years.
If not for Lin, maybe the giants will never understand, this crystal ball in the treasure will be so important a piece.
Because there are at least a hundred balls that look like this crystal ball.
And all of these crystal balls are the same shape, with the same texture and texture.
Only the first piece held by Lin was able to feel the fluctuation of the piece and thus find out which was the crystal ball.
After he entered the treasure, he quickly selected a large pile of various treasures.
He didn't select such a crystal ball, but concealed it from another pile of various treasures.
Gold, Crystals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Giant's treasures greatly enriched Lin's private treasures as the King of Evil and the Holy King.
It is when he finds a third piece in the spirit world, ready to fuse, that he begins to grasp the power of the turning circle.
In Reality.
Frodo, who is attached to the moon, is on the order of the scribe of the sphere of the sphere of the sphere of the sphere of the sphere of the sphere of the sphere of the sphere.
And at the same time.
Everywhere in the world, all the people of destiny who hold the sacred vessel of the heavens, have heard the guidance from the great sages of the Great Pond.
To guide them to a small town called Desher, to gather all the powers of the holy, and to defeat the magician of the sphere, Frodo.

The sun shines on the ground through thin black fog, forming a strange twisted line.
The wooden door cracked open.
Adoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudou
Has the erosion of the dust world been so serious?
He sighed.
Despite the growing erosion of the dust world and the black tide, these have had no effect on the holders of these divine sacred objects.
Their power is enough to cover the dust and the black fog around.
Knowing that he possessed the sacred of the heavens, he was found by the terror enemies of the dust world.
Adolf thought for a long time until he finally thought of a poor lie, and decided to leave the tree where he was born.
He left the Temple for so many days of the week with his beloved friends and elders.
Knowing his enemy was so strong that he could fight, Adolf knew that the future was ultimately his own.
You can't get anybody involved.
That's too dangerous for others.
Adov reached out for a letter that had not been received, and the fine marks on the top clearly recorded the evil deeds of the Pluto magician named Frodo, how he slaughtered his enemies, how he sealed up tens of thousands, and how he sank into the sea.
"Assembling the power of all, can summon the strongest power, and restore all?
What kind of thing is this?
With a sigh in his heart, he took up the letter, put on a broad round cap, fell down the cape, and walked away to a distance.
This trip, whether it's life or death, will always have a result.
If it succeeds, everything will return to its original form.
If he fails, the worst result is that he dies outside, not even tired of his friends.
This is the consciousness that belongs to him.
Lin never thought he would go to this place.
Sitting in the rough stone palace, a cup of pure tea was placed before him.
The Stone Temple is small basketball court, open round import and export, placed on both sides some armor weapons from the treasures of the giant king.
A huge candle-a crystal hanger- hung above the head.
The ground was covered with red carpet, and in the center stood a tall statue of him riding a bloody horse.
Lin softly touched the crystal.
The surface of the sphere is smooth and cold, inside as if there is a cluster of silvery clouds slowly spinning.
The whole sphere is silver blue, the base is made of an unknown light red wood, spreading fresh fragrance.
"The evil power is now essentially at the level of suppression, and it is not so easy to go up.
My aim is to raise the power, to stimulate the power.
But in fact, now I've entered the ranks, the power of evil is not great.
Lin is thinking about the system of power that he now possesses.
He has a lot of power, but it is not pure.
"Evil power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have to make a choice if I want to increase the quality and concentration of energy.
Linz knew that his body was a giant compressor, only a single energy of pure concentration could be compressed at a faster rate and achieve a higher quality.
He began to feel his powers were increasingly slow after using the Holy Power to break the boundary.
Evil will take a long time to build up.
The Holy Power hasn't broken yet.
Dragon Blood Synergy has been fixed to be so powerful, this is to look at opportunity and blood purity, his present Dragon blood blood ratio, has reached a fairly saturated level.
If you want to continue to raise the purity of the blood.
But purity can not be elevated at random, which also requires compression to purify.
"My strength is so mixed that there is no environment to purify.
There must be a choice.
Lin held up the hot tea gently.
A light tea, the heart, let him not to the spirit of one.
"For me, evil can be given up first.
I don't have the ability to learn it is just to touch the side.
He first wiped out evil.
"Secondly, the dragon's blood.
Originally, I was just trying to raise my strength enough to save more sacred power.
Now that I've broken through the ranks, in theory, I can communicate from source to source through the portal of the sea, transforming the chaos of the Spirit Sea into a pure sacred force.
"So this can be put down for a while.
"Thirdly, confusion of spirit....
This is the power I've been able to communicate from the Arctic Ocean.
Though infinite, there is no system, no good progress, no clearer direction.
Lin washed down.
"This is not to put down for a moment, after all the essence of the sacred force is the soul.
I should be the core of the soul, constantly strengthening and purifying.
All the core is the soul.
Lin thought through this, and quickly understood, what to focus on.
"The soul is the core of me.
With the soul, the sacred and the evil are only reproductions.
He took a cup of tea and stood up.
Taking the crystal ball, Lin slowly walked to the inner hall.
Thermal Palace, which is ther of Dekar and the king of the demons, orders all the craftsmen of the demon and the demon empire to work together to perfect it.
It was originally built by the Magicians.
Afterwards, the higher level of the Imperial Fairy King, in order to take Lin's ass, turns to get from the people around him things.
This exquisite interior is one of them.
That's where power is always fascinating.
"Take the power, everything else will come."
Lin said this in his heart.
He went under the Inner Temple, looked up at the sign of the Temple, and then walked into it.
And he that guarded the house was a great evil lord, of two heads, and of two men, and of two beasts.
Their upper half was a man, and their lower half was a giant worm like a half-man horse.
Dozens of black legs supported them standing on the ground as firmly as Mount Tai.
The strong men, who were dressed in black oiled shells, saw Lin coming, and kneed to him silently.
Lam did not listen to them, but looked straight at the middle of the inner court, the strange great knife on the ground.
For a long time, this turn of the evil circle, again there was some unknown change.
The large knife has been reduced a lot. The appearance is also thinned a lot.
There are three pieces.
Now let me see what will happen when the three pieces are fused together.
Lin raised his hand gently on the handle of the big knife.
Then another hand, the crystal ball, to the top gently press.
Ha Ha
Something wonderful happened.
Crystal balls, like softened liquids, float gently attracted and fused to the surface of the giant knife.
After a few seconds, the crystal ball disappeared completely into Linz's hands.
Chapter 463
Lin calmly grasped the big knife and quickly absorbed his remaining guard with sacred power.
In order to prevent other creatures from touching the treasure, he pre-enriched it with sacred power and attached it to the surface of the giant knife, so that it could better insulate the breath and fluctuations.
At the same time highly concentrated sacred power can also act as a protective treasure.
Anyone who wants to get close to take away the giant sword will be found by Lin and tracked up.
Unless the other can expel him from the top.
But if such an opponent arise, then it is not necessary to come in steal, directly to come in and rob it is not easier?
Lin flocked to the holy power attached to it, and stared quietly at the three pieces melted together into a roaring circle.
C C C C C C C
There was a sudden sound.
The giant knife was held in hand, and all of a sudden broke down, fell on the ground, began to melt and fall.
Like ice cream dissolved by sunlight, the process of dissolving is instantly accelerated by countless times.
Without even responding, Linmer saw his giant knife fall to the ground, silently dissolving into a black, thick liquid.
In his ecstasy, he seemed to hear the thunder of the invisible insects, and the sound of the rain beating the leaves of the tree.
The noise quickly turned into the noise of the waves hitting the reef.
It's as if there's a word in the ear, as if there's a multitude of pictures in the eye.
A great deal of knowledge was converted into a kind of black smoke that evaporated from the woods beneath the thick black liquid.
He was surrounded by black smoke, which contained countless sounds and information.
Time seemed to slow down at this moment.
Innumerable knowledge about evil spirits flew into the mind of Lin.
It's a very strange feeling.
It is not merely the introduction of a sea of knowledge into Lin's brain, but through a complete evolution of scenes, a more vague but complete way, to make it clear what is the root of the evil spirit's powerlessness.
"It's going to..."
A faint woman murmured to Lin's ears.
"It's going to..."
"It's going to..."
The voice repeated.
It's like a hypnosis that's what's going on in Lin's mind.
Slowly he closed his eyes, and in the darkness, a huge and immense gray circle appeared from the darkness.
The giant wheel is like a huge tooth wheel with four embedded spaces on the edge.
Soon, embedded objects began to appear.
A mount is a black crystal column.
One embedding is a white bone.
A mount is a crystal ball.
There's also anchoring, which is empty.
C C C
The giant wheeled slowly, but due to the lack of an embedded, it emitted a heavy fault click.
As if the whole wheel could not continue to move smoothly due to the lack of a mount.
Lin, looking at the giant wheel, saw that on its edges there were countless plants and fish, fine patterns of mountains and rivers, and countless insect-like characters crawling around.
This giant wheel is not a circle of mysterious treasure.
He opened his mouth and wanted to speak.
But before he had his turn, at the center of the great wheel, a small mouth opened, in which three streams of dark red blood flowed silently.
In the noise, these blood streams flew rapidly, circling Linming constantly, and then drilled into his chest.
There were three blood streams, each leaving three different small flower patterns on the chest of Lin.
The three threads together form a large complex circle.
Lin opened his eyes, took off his armor, and looked down at his chest.
There were three red marks on his chest.
The three marks combined, like one still missing, and after a complete alignment, it is a red circle full of chests.
The center of the circle has a flower like the eye, the flower is like a living thing, and the flower is constantly spreading towards the four sides, pale gray faint.
Hidden in the darkness can see countless symbols flowing.
Lin looked at his hands, where there was no big knife, no black liquid under his feet.
The so-called evil circle, seems to have run all over him.
He closed his eyes and felt a lot of information that had just poured into his mind.
"It's what's called the ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro ro.
It is one of the eighteen most powerful supervillains in the world of supervillains.
At that time the evil spirit did not have the natural gifts.
Demons are just a special body, not much different from others.
But since the supervillains have refined this treasure, they use this treasure to elevate the family of the supervillains through some mysterious special means, hard living into a group of naturally possessing powerful supernatural talents.
This treasure is not as if the demons were used to break the limits of the ethnic group and to enhance the cohesion of their own blood.
It was the most powerful demons, to break the limits of their own blood and race, to refine the great creature.
Conversely, having mastered the rotation of the evil circle, does not fully understand how to release all the evil spirits.
Rather, it automatically receives the supernatural blessings of eighty-eight supernatural spirits.
"Addition 88..."
Lin opened his eyes and stretched out his hand.
He could feel a strange force, like a force field, around his body.
There are dozens of different winds in the stock market.
These powers are like giant snakes hiding in his shadows, exposing their claws only when needed.
"The eighty-eight kinds of protection, eighty-eight kinds of abnormality, can be summed up into four kinds."
Lin began to categorize according to the information in the brain.
First, strengthen your own existence wheel.
"Secondly, weaken your opponent's hijacking ship."
Third, a free-riding rotor.
"The Fourth..."
Lin's eye suddenly froze.
"The fourth is missing.
Indeed, it will be necessary for the final fragments to be integrated in order to obtain the final power.
eight and eighteen,?I have received the first three categories, plus seventy kinds of protection, and at last only some kinds of protection are missing.
As it stands, these few absences are probably the most important.
Lin's mind.
He looked around, and there was no force to try to protect.
Rather,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then before he stepped in he got the black crystal column in the evil spirit gate.
Ha Ha
As the winded, Lin had just returned from the transmission, and saw a bleak, white flame sweeping toward him.
Before he could resist, a gray light was naturally rising on his body, firmly preventing the fire from burning.
Lindsay felt a little hot in her chest, and looked down at the loose tie.
The red circle pattern on the chest, at this time became more clearly bleeding.
Chapter 464
"Are there wheels?" Lin thought.
He went forward with a flame.
This frozen fire, equal to five wings, could not touch his skin at this moment in front of him.
He didn't use any power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's just the power of the new hand to automatically help him protect everything.
In the thick white flame pillar, Lin slowly descended from half the air.
There was a slight deviation from what was just transmitted to the inside of the flame.
He got out of the fire column, circled around, foot by foot.
The whole man jumped and flew away.
After running a few thousand meters in one direction, Lin stopped at a slightly elevated top of the hill, and gazed quietly at the vast terrain around him.
On the flat ground, there was a path of emission of a gray-white fire.
This space is like a heavily wounded post-war soldier, on the brink of death, still struggling to breathe.
Just try it here.
Lin has the heart to try to protect the force.
He stretched out his hand, and fired at a distant fire pillar.
Then try to transfer the power of the hijacker.
Come on!
An invisible fluctuation flew out of Lin's index and landed accurately on the surface of the earth's pillar.
There's no.
Their columns became rapidly transparent, and after a few seconds they became fainter and fainter, and finally disappeared completely from their place, as never before.
Lindsay put down her fingers and waited quietly for a long time, until she saw the pillar re-fire.
"So, the hijacker in the escort, is it fundamentally eliminating the existence of the other?
Lin may have thought.
Their ideals, naturally, were refined by the supreme powers of the evil spirit.
In theistic world, the ultimate devils think that the answer is to destroy each other thoroughly on the basis of the soul.
So theft ships gather dozens of different powers, and ultimately gather together to perform the powers, to completely eradicate the opponent?
Lin is a bit.
Then it's a reinforcement of its own existence.
He looked down again at the drawing of the blood circle on his chest.
Then stretch out again, according to the information and knowledge, gently in front of the body a finger crossed like a circle print.
Let go!
He opened his eyes, and his chest suddenly poured out a great deal of red light, and covered him up and down.
Oh Oh Oh
A five-and-a-half meters thick red light swept up the sky, stirring up the clouds above.
A lot of gray white clouds are dyed red with blood and thunder.
Soon, the spotted red light turned into a huge fire.
In the flame, a clear person slowly opened his arms.
What is the best way to strengthen oneself for the devil?
"I didn't expect this to be the answer..."
Within the veil of blood, Lin had lost sight of his face and body, only a pair of pale gold eyes flowing like a whirlwind of gold.
It's too strong.
I'm like that I'm even afraid of myself.
"I'm afraid I'll ruin everything if I'm not careful."
Lin raised his eyes to the distance, once enchanted in this infinitely powerful special state.
With such power, no one can stop him from doing anything.
No one!
Reality.
"HaHaHaHaHa!"
In the gray sky, Frodo dressed in a black robe, with his white hair blown madly by the air.
He laughed loudly and released a ring of gray energy vibrating waves.
A huge wave of vibration spreads all around, wiping out all things around.
The demons below the tower, forming an army, round after round of bombing and firing, as if they were a thick blanket, unqualified to touch the side of Frodo.
Guns and devils, like weak and powerless insects, are constantly trying to beat the gray wave.
But every break is useless and will only return ineffectively.
"Are you feeling desperate?" laughed Frodo.
"It's really disappointing.
Humans a thousand years ago are not so small now.
There were heroes, there were clouds, and even if they were as strong as me, they had to be careful.
But now? Look at you?
Frodo's deep eyes.
It's a very contradictory psychology.
I wish you could be stronger and I don't want you to be stronger and not waste my spirit.
Let me consume more.Do you have to kill me to the heavens?
In the front of the many powers on the ground, a tall old man with a white beard standing on his shoulders, stared coldly at the psychic magician in the sky.
Are you not afraid of the earth, when you are the god of the earth, and when you are not under the earth, and do not serve the Lord of the earth well?
The old man's tone was calm, but the contents were as clear as the palms of his hands.
`Oh? said Frodo, slightly surprised.
"It looks like there's someone on earth who remembers my Frodo.
He looked down at the old man.
It's the first time he's seen a man like this since he left the island of Biscay.
"Mankind is able to know the inside of the great chamber.
It looks like I've got to re-evaluate the tower.
He laughed.
"What if we destroyed this land? We fled into secrets, came out again after decades, but it was all a new beginning.
But what about you?
The Magician Frank.
What will it cost you to get through this ordeal?
The old man looked cold, as if most of humanity were extinct, and in his eyes there was nothing great.
It's really cool.
Compared to the outside world, the number of insiders is quite different.
And you dare to give up everything in one word?
Frodo was also somewhat surprised by the outcome of the other.
"Isn't that's what the Moon wants?
The End The beginning of the new.
said the old man.
Near him, the remaining demons of the tower looked angry and red, and it was evident that many people thought of this terrible future.
As they looked at Frodo, they all wanted to hurry up and fight with him.
After all, most of the demons are actually in real life, secrets can not accommodate so many people.
Therefore, destroying reality, it is equivalent to them to cut off their children, their relatives completely.
No one can accept such a result.
Isn't it? said Frodo, "Well, let me see how many of you are really willing to go into hiding.
He meant a long look at the wicked behind the old.
"If you can't speak, then try.
If you want to destroy the tower, see how much you want to pay!
As the old man's eyes cooled, a large ice stick quickly appeared in his hand.
"Come together!" he said with his stick.
Suddenly, a huge silver frame washed up on the ground, placing Frodo in the center of the sky.
Chapter 465 The Final Fragment
in thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee of thee.
Their gentle voices attracted all the chiefs of the army.
Poems are created by the old nobility of the fairy empire, the song is moving, the tone is beautiful, the words are beautiful and the philosophy is rich.
But is it a little too shameful to be praised in my face?
Lin, sitting on the throne of the evil king, looked at the king of horses and the king of fairies on the right.
The King washed his head and seemed to sink into the song.
Then the fairy king shut his eyes and drink the good wine, and the spirit remained.
But anyway her one eye occupied the whole face, and couldn't see any expression.
The Guardian sits on the lower side of this great hall of power, which makes the demons of the The Guardians not angry, but the fact is that his power is too weak.
The Giant Twins, because they were in good shape, sat at the end of the seat, drinking and eating meat without saying a word.
A A A
Suddenly a sound of heavy footsteps came from outside the temple.
"Here is the mother of the dragon!"
It was at this moment that the caller's voice came in.
"Mother of the Sins" The many commanders on the scene were all a little.
They knew the existence of the dragon tomb from Linming and Tianjin Xianggu. But they didn't know the specifics, and never saw the members of the strong inside.
And now is the time to meet this strange new member.
At the gate, a woman in a black long dress, dressed as a gorgeous blonde, was about to enter the palace with a smile.
She stood in the midst of the great hall, in a loud voice, and kneeed a little to Lin.
"The powerful demon king, the mother of the sin dragon with the dragon tomb many dragon souls, come to wait for life."
Silent Mother's voice with subtle dust, soft and sexy, can imagine she must have been an irresistible top beauty before birth.
Unless she washed herself with the ghost of death, it was estimated that the chiefs of the army, such as the king of horses and the king of giants, would join her in the pursuit.
"I want to marry her," said the king of horses. "I want to marry her."
His throat washed with saliva, and his blood flowed as fast as boiling.
Their eyes were filled with blood, with an unspeakable desire and expectation.
"Yes," said Lin.
"If you don't mind the mother of the dragon being dozens of times bigger than you, I think she'll be happy to accept your pursuit.
The premise is that you will not be put to death on the night of your new marriage.
"It's a...
The King washed off with a cold water, and suddenly thermal blood in his eyes vanished, and he caught his hair in shame.
He was the top man in control of blood, stronger than the general rank.
Whoever sees his bloody head looks like he's ready to go.
There's no doubt that iron must have been worn, or he would have liked to have done it.
It's obvious that's a bloody man and a natural body and talent, but the man and the horse is the one that doesn't move.
So now he's off the edge of being drawn, and he's back to normal.
Let it be, let it be enjoyed by the most powerful.
To learn humility in the face of the strong.
The Lady of Sin, standing in the Great Hall, her eyes flashed, a black force coalesced into a line, suddenly shot at the King of Horses.
P P P
The Horse King responded by stepping on the black line of power.
"Let's go!
You are here!!!!!
You didn't put the statue in your eyes!Your Dragon Tomb was about to be rebuilt, were you?
Silent Dragon Mother's cheek was completely shocked by the shameless King of Horses.
She didn't think she was such a brave man, but she was such a brave man.
The speed of wearing her hat is not usually fast.
"I'm just in reverence You don't respect the stronger, Be weak and learn to be humble!"
"If you were not here, you would have died in a dragon's tomb!"
"Hah, give me a hand."
The King is not at all.
"You're looking for death! "The mother of the dragon was provoked by a great anger, and she had to do it.
Silence!
Xian, who sits on the side, said.
I can't hear the music!
As she spoke, the mother of the dragon and the king of the horse had to squeeze, no more to speak.
Their Power,they both know.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No.
All right, sit down, Mother of the Dragon.
Lin is a good sound.
"The musician is gone."
He looked at the magician on the right side of the stone.
Theman immediately indicated that the singer stopped and took him away quickly.
As soon as the fairies moved their wings, they flew up the palace with a little green fluorescence, and put their cold plates of fruit and tea in their hands on the small tables in front of the troops.
The stone gates slowly close together under the action of the French.
Lin looked at all the strong.
On the left,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
On the right is the king of the horse, the mother of the dragon, the witch of the decar.
With a glance, he had taken the powers of the five ranks.
The power of the demons with an unspeakable exaggeration of speed, the fast expansion became a huge thing.
Commander is a rank, and below, is a rank of Commander-in-Chief.
There are many of the giant king of the giant empire. There are also many under the king of the horse.
And the dragon's souls in the dragon's tomb, and every one of them has the rank of the warrior, but they are not completely conquered by Lin, but only obey the sin dragon mother.
Thermal Warrior level, located under thermal warrior, belongs to the top of the six wing, and the number of the Thermal Warrior that can be used should be more than two.
Third is the evil general level.
There are too many of them. There are hundreds of them in the original spirit caves, and Linming's previous experiments have transformed many of them.
Moreover, the Empire, under the command of the King of Horses, has more than a hundred.
This level is equivalent to the three-winged devil.
As for the lower common demons, they are in the tens of thousands.
Thermal Palace is now able to shake hands with the three real secrets, to see who wins and who loses.
But that's not enough.
Lincoln wants more than that.
"I'm glad you all get here on time.
Lin opened his mouth.
"This is the palace of the devils. This is the highest place of the devils. This is the place where I will unite all the devils in the future."
His voice spread far, and inside the hall seemed to be rolling and shaking like thunder.
Not only could all the commanders in the shop hear, but some of the nearest evil generals could hear as well.
"This time to summon you to come is to convey to you a way of greater power," said Lin.
Chapter 466 The Final Fragment 2
"Higher Power" ""The Lord" ""The Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord
She's lived so many years she's never seen a fool to send so many people.
Is the Devil a fool?
Of course not.
She glanced across the sky.
There was no expression on the face of the red-haired woman.
Only a face of boredom.
Likewise, the rest of the people are even more disturbed.
The King is not interested in these bends, he has decided to follow Linming from the beginning to the end, so as long as Linming's decision he must follow!
"It seems too weak to reject our power! Ha Ha!
But since it is a blessing, my old horse is the first to take it away!
He smiled at once.
What's going to happen if nobody supports it?
Isn't it cool?
"I'm looking forward to it," replied the fairy.
Her arm had been taken back, and seemed to have recovered safely.
"The supreme decision is our will."
Thermal Hands is even more direct.
The Giant Brothers said nothing, no expression.
They've just been defeated, the treasures have been stolen, and it's hard to believe they're in a good mood.
Neither did Lin.
"In fact, I really dislike your weakness.
He said quietly.
"Time is changing.
Power can't stop either.
He extended his hand upward, slowly releasing a white, pure, divine ball, which had drilled out of his hand, and which was still hanging in the air a few centimeters from his hand.
It moves slowly.
This force is called sacred force.
Lin explained.
"The sacred power is in essence higher than the soul power, higher than all the powers you possess.
If you don't believe, you can try it yourself.
Linming lighted the ball, broke, suddenly radiated a number of sacred rays, perfectly in front of the major armies.
The line was converted into the Small Light Ball, hanging in front of the commanders.
"You can use your own power to touch the collision and see who's stronger.
If you're sure you want to master this new power, you can come and see me later.
I will give him the first kind.
When he had finished, without waiting for the commanders to question him, he opened the second topic, which was not to be discussed, but to be formalized.
Lin raised his hand, and at once the fairy king condensed a blue ball, flying to Lin Lin.
The water ball washed up by the forest, and then spread out into a large, transparent, multifaceted, several meters in diameter, displayed in front of the public.
The multifaced, like crystal, slowly began to emerge a clear black desert picture, in which the desert was grounded, stretching to the end of the view.
There was an endless sandy hill, with thermal and mysterious purple sun on the top, and a single-headed camel on a difficult walk in the sandy hill.
It's an area where thermal temperatures are also hot, and where thermal roasting distorts the evaporation.
This is the evil world that you will conquer.
"In general, we would classify this kind of secret world, whether it's a demon or not, and we would focus on one key point," said Mr. Lin. "Is there a pure soul life like that of a demon?"
He pointed at the unicorn in the picture.
"Every place that can naturally raise soul creatures will be one of the lower worlds under the command of my evil spirits.
The world you see is larger than usual, and as to whether or not there is a world of evil spirits, you must go and inspect it yourself.
"Within three days, I will have a complete assessment of this secret world. I need to know how long it will take to completely conquer this small world."
Listen to your will.
Many of the commanders below bend back in response.
They didn't know why Lin had to conquer so many small demons, but since it was a high demand, it had to be done.
Lin noted that he needed to find the last piece of the secret world.
He didn't intend to tell anyone about the turning of the circle.
Don't let others know your strength, it can guarantee your own prosperity.
If you don't get to the bottom, you don't get to the bottom.
Because people don't know your strength and weakness, naturally don't dare to take light steps, if accidentally hit the strongest part of your strength. That's the way to die.
Afterwards, Lin asked once again about the development of the Devil's Palace.
These are all managed by the Decar.
He is the great ruler of the evil kingdom, though weak, but represents the will of Lin.
So none of the seats dare to disregard him.
The Guardian has been reporting on recent developments and changes.
And reported the first exploration of this new black desert devil cave.
Knowing that desert was home to a large number of suspected human races and cities, the commanders of the armed forces who were sitting there were all of a sudden very interested.
The meeting took more than an hour.
Majors returned to their own territories and began preparing for troops to deploy to the Black Desert.
Lin, taking advantage of the previous thoughts, returns to the Yang Temple, and begins to organize his current power system.
To completely purify yourself, to achieve the best environment to enhance the quality of power, then need a perfect no impurities enclosed environment.
At this point, of the eighty-eight guards, there is one guard that can satisfy Lin's demands.
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
But in fact these eighty-eight kinds of protection, Linz can use any one of them separately.
Despite the fact that he now lacks several of the most critical supports due to his lack of debris, there are few of the supports available to him to achieve this goal.
After dealing with the evil world, Lin follows the transmission door back to Star Trek.
He hasn't come back for a long time, he almost forgets the different effects of time flow.
Sometimes he really thinks he's been there for a long time, because he didn't give his family a message, he calls back as soon as he gets back.
He was told to call the day before.
In reality, Stella is still unlocked, under the umbrella of the sun tower, still moving slowly, like a large precision instrument.
Today, Trinidad and Tobago has formed a unique social system centered on the temple and the saints.
Christianity has become an emerging profession.
They practice sacred power, go to various industries, use supernatural power to heal people, help people.
It is also due to the greatness of the Holy Light, and to the purification of the spirit and the easing of fatigue carried by the purification of the field of power.
Justice, majesty, but also mercy and healing of the mind and body, that is the people's awareness of the Holy Light.
Chapter 467 The Last Fragment 3 Linz calculated the time after he entered the world of the evil spirit.
He spent more than a month in the spirit world, but it turned out that he spent less than a week outside.
The speed of time makes him uncomfortable with the cognition of date.
I was walking on the street.
In the city's safe area, a building once wasted, has been revived by the influx of people.
Gasoline cars on the streets have been cleaned up and replaced with cleaner electric cars.
Most electric cars have been modified to make them more practical.
The safety area is limited to accommodate more people, to improve the more congested traffic.
They are nearly half the size of conventional vehicles, and they can fly briefly in low air.
Lin was walking down the street, and saw a car passing from the ground, and a half-air shuttle between the floors.
This was supposed to be the wonder of the city of the future, but now it is clearly presented to him.
"The Temple of the Dark is already perfect, and the ascension of the Temple of the Dark was previously forgotten by the hands of the Pluto.
It's all done now.
Lin, as he walked, soon returned from the research center to the temple.
The Temple's accumulated sacred power has been huge, the great sacred power pool has appeared full for a long time.
Their dispersed power even caused the temple to float around in the air.
That's the Holy Grail.
As long as the temples need to use sacred power, they will spontaneously convert back into pure sacred power.
Lin went into the temple without any disturbing anyone, and came quietly into the prayer room.
There was no one in the prayer room, and the door was locked.
Usually it is not prayer time, here is not allowed anyone to enter at will.
Lin came to the prayer stand and closed his eyes slowly.
Ha Ha
In the darkness of the moment adds a huge map of the Trinity.
The map is like a sand plate, and is gently rotated according to the clock.
C C C
Suddenly there was a slight noise on the map, the sandy terrain slowly descended, and then separated from the middle.
Thermal Landscape was divided into two, and a gray-black pillar was raised from the separate crack.
There is a clear mark on the black stone column.
Please verify the fingerprint.
To take the next step, you need the temple to bind the hand.
The soft woman again.
Lin went ahead and stretched out his hand and pressed it gently on the palm of the stone.
'The fingerprints are finished.
Welcome to the Selection Interface.
Suddenly, a new tree figure appeared in Linming's eyes. From the temple style, the line extended upwards, forming more than six different branches.

Don't Rise.
Finally, Lin noted, the end of the curtain was marked with small letters.
'These six spells are the ultimate upgrades. After the upgrades are completed, the complete construction of the Temple of Darkness will be completed.
Are these the final forms?
But if you think about it, the rituals that were built in this temple were, in fact, the products of the masters of the city.
Actually, the level is not very high.
Achieving this level is estimated to be the limit to which they can reach.
He looked down at the great power pool.
It's just a million.
So he did without hesitation the choice of the crystal pool.
Hum.
Something shakes in the dark, and then quickly ends.
The aggregate of sacred power fell to zero instantly. Immediately thereafter it rebounded rapidly and recovered to about 20,000.
Is the number of crystals converted back before?
Lin has some guesses.
Two Thousands of the holy power, say more, say less, say more.
He's all lost in the Ring. He's raised to the second level.
When the selection is completed, all the steps will be completed in the next few days.
Lin has withdrawn from operation space.
Having determined that there was no problem at the temple headquarters on the west side, he rushed back to the research center, gave the little peacock in the lower room some attention, and returned again through the evil gate to the evil palace.
Now is the last piece of the urgent to find, he must be attentive at all times, and when necessary to go the first time.
As soon as he stepped into the castle of the evil spirit, there was a guard of the evil spirit to send him to the army.
The Guardian quickly alerted the superiors.
Lin, standing in front of the evil spirit gate, received the urgent report hurriedly.
"The Black Desert is the most powerful, the vanguard army is defeated, the king of horses is severely damaged."
"Well, you just got in there and met a strong enemy?"
The power of the king of horses, under his command, the witch of Bedegal, the king of fairies, all are strong.
But here it's been rewrapped as soon as it starts?
"How is it now?
Contact me over there.
He handed the General's Message to the Deagle.
"The giant brothers and the mother of the demons have come forward to support.
They should be able to return soon.
The Guardian.
"Do you know the information of the opponent?
"I've learned some things.
Decacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacacaca
Lin came to look at once, suddenly revealed some unexpected color.
"That's interesting.
It's kind of interesting!
He couldn't help showing a strange smile.
"The man who killed the king of horses was a tall man with a chest engraved with transparent round stones.
He promised a moon messenger to hang the enemy from the outside.
After enquiring about the king of horses and the army of evil spirits, he immediately launched an attack.
"How did he beat the king of horses?" Linz had guessed the identity of the other, he said softly.
"The man is very strong, and his martial arts are very skillful, and most importantly, his resistance is terrible, and he has no use either in the attack of the soul or in any other attribute.
And even if you cut him off, you can't kill him.
He'll recover right away.
The King is at a time, was severely attacked.
Lin raised his head.
"Let the demon, the giant brother, and the sin of the mother of the dragon take the power, and let them all in."
I want to catch the man.
If he didn't guess, the last fragment, should have a self-consciousness, so manipulate it to give power to the strong, come to guard the rabbit.
Because when Linsen sensed him, it also sensed in reverse to this side, at the moment when it touched back.
Lin thought it was a spontaneous energy reaction of the last fragment.
But I didn't expect it to be the last piece of self-awareness.
Chapter 468
Ancient poems with mysterious music, singing in the sky.
A large three-dimensional white and blue array, constantly rotating the signs of the sea and the powers of the evil.
Innumerable energy flows from within the tower, guiding the various energy particles around the heavens and the earth to gather here.
Thousands of frames, combined into the ultimate enormous seal frames.
Sealing is the best way to deal with a strong like Frodo.
Lin was able to think of the way the heaven tower was able to think of, and to do better.
Many years ago, they themselves gathered a large number of people of sealed blood.
Now suddenly used, for Frodo is just an unspeakable attack.
His body was suspended in the midst of the air, and his face looked downward; and the great array of thousands of meters in diameter was right in the midst of all that surrounded him.
The wave of energy that surrounds the array is like a multitude of threads that come together and bind him.
Even fragile spiders aggregate enough to go far beyond steel ropes.
What's more, at this time, these arrays are condensed into evil threads.
Without any number of evil threads, under the cohesion of the heaven tower, by the remaining number of positions, etc. guide the head, at this moment concealed emerges a half-transparent angel with only two wings.
"Are you an angel? Well, I haven't seen this kind of thing in years.
"Look," said Frodo, looking at the scene in front of him.
"But do you have an angel to seal me?
Do you think too simple? Thousands of years ago, I could have slain angels by myself, not to mention now!
Frodo looked down at the position where the feet had been bound by countless transparent strings.
There are more and more strings.
"But I, who can make this form, feel a bit of awkward, and you are too proud."
He raised his right hand.
"The curse of the stone."
"The curse of God."
"The curse of fear."
"A curse," "A spirit."
"Higher Level Enforcement Angel".
"The Light of the High".
His lips moved slightly, and in just two seconds, a great deal of magical words, spells, were immediately in effect.
Their bodies shimmered like electric currents.
Ha Ha
At the same time four sharp spears appeared around him in the void air.The spears were of a semi-transparent color, and their tips were surrounded by a string of signs.
Come on!
Suddenly four spears disappeared from the ground, appearing instantly in the four-way crowd that presided over the parade on the ground.
Come on!
There was a clear explosion in the crowds for a few seconds.
"It's an attack on the spirit, it can't be stopped, it can't be avoided.
I can only endure.
Frodo smiled.
Along with the disintegration of the lower crowd, many were even passed by the shock of the psychic explosion.
"I'm here to stop his attack.
All the rest, continue!
The Old One, raised his hand and said.
As he moved forward, his upper garments burst, revealing the silver and white coat he wore inside.
"Snow"!
His hands were stretched out, and a great evil green light flashed behind him, and a gray swirl suddenly appeared above his head.
It's like the sea is crazy pouring out the sea of the green power.
As soon as the power fell, under the influence of some strange power, it became a hard cold white ice, covered by the old.
Soon his whole body washed up with rough white edges, these sharp, dense edges, all together, made up his only strong defense.
"Stop me?"
Frodo laughed.
"If you know that I am a magician, then you should know that I am the best, but not the one who fights in front of himself..."
He lifted his head, his white hair fastened, thickened, and wound up in the sky a huge gray-black half-body giant.
The black giant had a single horn, muscles tied like trees, and little fleshy wings behind it.
Within his hands was a huge black pillar.
"The Guardian".
Come on, destroy here! said Frodo.
Oh Oh Oh
The gray giant behind him gave a gentle response. The five-meter-high body flew forward, and after the hair had broken, it accelerated rapidly, crashing down into the earth like a fracture of meteor.
But soon, a column below jumped up into the sky, using a sophisticated old giant tower shield, accurately preventing the Pluto pillar.
The summon was stopped by Frodo, who did not think of it. It was only a small character that he had summoned at his discretion.
"Madroun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
Call,,,,,,,,,,!
He recited in a loud voice all the taboos and names of another powerful existence.
True names are not so easy to read.
This inscription in the depths of the soul is the unique representation of time and space.
When reciting, it is necessary to imagine the complete image of the other, and it is also necessary to recite the complete strength of the other, events, history, characteristics, etc.
Eventually, with the permission of the other, it is possible to summon the other in a genuine way.
And this is what Frodo is doing.
It was only the rituals, which would have required a great deal of preparation and a great deal of resources and manpower, which were greatly reduced by his enormous power of oracle, that eventually formed such an easy-to-use oracle summon.
As Frodo recalled, in the mid-air behind him, gradually began to appear a two-meter tall strange man behind whom were thirteen pairs of arms.
The soldier was wearing rough leather, red feet, and the coat was also rotten, as if it had not been put on for a long time.
What attracted most attention was the man behind, with two thin purple blades slightly curved.
The summoned man seems to have no intelligence, eyes red.
As soon as he appeared, he cried out, and drew his sword against the next one.
Come on!
Crossed by an X-shaped silver knife, the moment flies and lands like a meteor.
Initially there were only two ways, but as the distance increased, rapidly spreading out, like copying, instantaneously interchanged into hundreds of knives.
As each of the blades falls, it becomes a substantial silver metal monster.
Their heads were sharp like knives, their bodies were as thin as grass, and their speed was as fierce as a snake.
Kill!
A large group of Heaven Tower demons know that now is the critical moment, to jump out.
It's been for a long time and it's been able to stand with Fro until now, indicating that it's still working well,
With a little more power, maybe we'll be able to completely seal Falludor back into the realm.
Chapter 469
There was an empty area near the battlefield, near a low pit, where the air was twisted in shape, and a group of men and women dressed differently appeared at the same time on this confused battlefield.
Some were dressed as if they had just come out of their home and hadn't come to change their sleeping clothes, and some were dressed in racing clothes like motorcycle racers and wearing helmets on their heads.
There was another face, with a bowl in his hand.
It's here.
Among the crowd, a young man, clothed in white, looked up at half the sky to Frodo.
"How fast? We've just run from the border to the river?" said the man with the shovel.
"It's just sending," said an old voice in the ears of all.
"Now," said Pharaoh, "behold, before you, the holders of the sacred instruments of the heavens, how to decide, how to act, is all in your minds.
It's up to you decide.
"Hah," he said.
They've driven us here, and if we don't do it, can we? said a woman in a bed.
"Well, since we're all here, it's sure that everyone knows what this is all about.
In fact, there is a spirit within the divine sanctuary itself, as long as we are close to Falludor, the power to initiate.
Give it to the British.
A tall old man ink, low.
"In any case, since it has come, it represents that you are all well aware."
Adolf looked at the other without making a sound.
He looked at the half of the sky, and suddenly thought of home.
The elders in the temple, the companions who pray together, and the king of the night who lays in bed and does not want to wake up...
"Come on.
"How do we summon the soul of ourselves, the sacred instrument will tell us the answer," said the inkman quietly.The first took the lead towards the Frodo.
The others remained silent and followed.
It only made Adam doubtful that these people were saying that they had an instrument of divine life, but that they themselves had an instrument of divine life, which, according to the logic, should be able to resonate with them.
But when he got here, he didn't feel any part of these people.
Some of it is just a secret of life.
Though he doubted, he thought about how he could be fooled, and he was not about to take his own life to make fun of himself.
Therefore, it is possible that there is a means that he does not know, that can be used to converge the breath.
Come on!
In the desert sky, rolling like a giant rock, rolled over thick layers of cloud from above.
In the black desert, the atmosphere is depressed and depressed.
On the sand, a large group of evil spirits, either running or flying, followed by the evil warriors, rushed to the front of the desert camp.
The desert troops are mainly white. They are dressed with a kind of special armor attached to them.
The Devil is a black mixed army, pure soul life and blood and flesh life mixed together, forming a special powerful three-dimensional strike pattern.
Far away the devil hand, near the devil warrior fight.
Soldiers in the desert, besides armor, are more than ordinary people, both body and soul, are common.
Faced with a 3 hit, one time dead and wounded, the joints defeated.
Lin, riding the blood, slowly and straight into the field.
Neither the devil nor any of the other's soldiers could approach him within ten meters.
On the hills ahead, the Giant Brothers are fighting with the mysterious desert mighty.
The fight has been for a long time.
Once they knew each other's details, the Giant Brothers were more cautious.
And the man with a stone in his chest, And this time again, And out of the rear army came some mighty seemingly good mighty.
All of these mighty men had little, thin, green wings, like the leaves of a leaf, hanging beneath their bodies, which they could not see when they were not working.
Linming stared at the battle so quietly, the queen and the mother of the demon standing beside him, looking calmly at the two brothers of the giant.
In the opposite camp, there were a number of strong souls, which passed over to Linming side. Stand against them.
Only all of the other's eyes, in a moment of contact with Lin, like a shock, suddenly shrinking back.
I can't go looking again.
It's too slow.
Lam looked at the mother of the wicked; and the latter came to mind.
As a magician and a master of magical rituals, the mother of the demons, when she first saw Lin, was able to unleash the magical enchantment, although it was not successful.
However, the original effect was to deepen the memory of Lin.
As the dragon-a step out, a purple array emerged beneath her feet, turning her eyes and transferring her to the middle of the opposite battlefield.
She appeared behind the mighty deserter, while he was not ready, fingers gently behind his brain spoon.
A circle of purple light exploded, turning into a circle of complex arrays, sealed on the back of the man.
The man washed his eyes, and fell softly.
Isn't it easy to look at the two brothers of the giant?
Shit!
In a moment, axe was blown from behind her, and her feeble waist was cut off, and her throat was thrown into another sandy hill more than ten meters away.
Silly Forge! cried the Black Giant, raising his fist again to the waking desert man.
Their ranks distorted the air, fiercely collided with, and raised a large wave of sand.
Oh Oh!
She was thrown into the sands and was disgraced, and even her skirt was thrown.
This caused her anger on the spot, a breath out of the sand, and her body expanded dramatically.
In the midst of his eyes, a huge dragon, ten meters long, landed on his legs, and screamed at the desert man.
Hus Hus Hus Hus Hus!
The giant is black, has a giant lizard body, two wings on the back seem to have degenerated, only two similar to a bone scar.
She screamed and a lot of fine ash flew out of her mouth.
As the ash washed out and touched the ground, the sand was turned into a grey stone, and the bodies touched the ground, and all of them were turned into stone carvings.
After the desert man again flies the two, stern to the mother of the wicked, floating cash glow, repelled petrochemical breathing.
Both joined the battle and stopped her.
"A lot of the strong seem to be ready. "Linson descended through the thick deck.
'Go, too,' he said, looking back at the worker who had followed him.
"I wish I had more swords."

Lin did not look at the situation.
Instead, the vision shifted away towards the northwest.
There was a fluctuation of power with the same source, sneaking into the fight here.
"The last piece?" Lin grinned.
"Initiate a general attack.
The Lord.
"We haven't won yet," he said, "and now we're going to go all over, and maybe we're going to get hurt."
Their Lord said.
Do as I say.
Lin did not act.
Come on!
A loud sounded from behind him.
Lin immediately felt a cold from behind the heart instant.
His power was broken in a moment, and the assassin's weapon penetrated through the opening of his armor, which was rearranged at dawn, and pierced his skin.
Chapter 470
Lee.
After a sound like a cut of wood. The sharp blade of the slinger was so precise as to stab at the back of Lin.
I couldn't get in.
Everything is stuck in a moment.
His knife washed up in the hole of the armor and could not be moved.
At the same time, a huge, thick to the limits of the natural force field, quiet to some ordinary natural force field before abruptly replaced.
Lin did not return, a hand stick out.
His hands were fast, almost raised, and had passed through the assassin's chest instantly.
"It's a good attack this time.
He threw away the body, and the Holy Power flashed, and immediately cleansed the blood and water stains of his hand.
Oh Oh Oh Oh
All the armies of the evil castle were pushing forward.
The remaining troops began a quiet and rapid march.
With a glance at the almost invisible army, at this moment, like a tide, suddenly the desert army on the opposite side was drowned and dispersed.
Lin did not attend the meeting.
Instead of riding a blood demon, step by step toward the direction of the fluctuation of breath.
Each step of the vampire seems to be slow, but in fact speed is extraordinary.
The head was as strong as the evil spirit of the horse, and he went in that direction carrying the forest.
Soon he crossed a sandy hill and threw everyone behind him.
The Blood soon stopped at the edge of a black green, looking away at the three standing on the edge of the green.
It's three strong desert fighters with the same chest embedded in red stone.
The Three stared at Lin.
Their enemy, who was waiting to be buried, was dressed in a heavy armor, and was riding on a black horse, which was as strong as it could be, and was wearing a heavy armor.
Before they got close, they felt a pressure that was holding one breath.
"No," he said.
That's him!
The only female voice.
"I wish Moonstone had him for us! Kill him!"
She pulled out the knife on her back, and the blue current jumped on her body, the first of which was to run to Lin.
At the same time, the other two men also from the other two directions, pulling the sword in front of the siege.
The three together, as if they had been fighting for many years.
Three Purple Lightning Swirls From Three Long Swords Swirls From Three Long Swords Swirls From Three Long Swords Swirls From Three Long Swords
Several long-dressed women emerged quickly in the bush far from the green.
There were words in their mouths, and a mysterious force came from half the sky, and instantly suppressed most of the powers of the evil circle.
"Oh," said Lin, "it's hard to get me out of here.
There really is a way to suppress the protective power of my body.
He was riding, faced a number of attacks, suddenly caught a hand.
Come on!
The High Coordinated Power Suddenly became in his hands a giant long sword three meters long.
Come on!
The Great Sword cut off the three who were striking.
Before the swords touched the other swords, an invisible terror field, dead to death, crushed the three dropped dragon.
P P P P P!
Three Thunders blinked.
The giant sword carried the great power of terror and fell on the first head of the woman.
Come on!
A crack of more than ten meters, appeared in the sky before the forest.
He took up his huge sword and looked down at the sword-woman who had just been hiding.
What's the power just hiding from me?
Answer me! He opened his eyes, and his back was a sword standing in the air on his right.
Come on!
An Invisible Fluctuation washed up and cracked.
Several of the robes who were practising in the distance suddenly bleeded their mouths, and their faces were like gold paper.
This is the place where the moon is born, the first pool of what is called the moonless place!
Regret that you dare come here alone, next day, is your death!
A tall old man came out of the depths of Greenland, each with a huge hammer.
Each hammer is about the size of an adult.
When two hammers together, just looking at the shape, you know that is absolutely not the common part.
The old man's hair was made up of fine braided hair, and his beard was put on his chest, and he was dressed in black, some of the ancient, black armour, which contrasted sharply with the pure white armour of Lin.
"I'm so old, I don't enjoy myself at home, but I have to run here to die."
Lin glanced at the old with interest.
"It's been five years since the last days.
I didn't expect to come old and give me a war.
The old man laughed.
If you want to kill me, see if you have this real thing!
There was a roaring tiger behind him, and a great and powerful black tiger appeared.
The giant appears to have already been covered with armor and weapons.
He turned and hit the hammer with his hand.
"Here is the old man!"
He shouted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With his eyes squinted, he felt clearly from the old man that a thick wave of fragments was spreading.
Have you put all your treasures on this old man?
He laughed coldly and put his sword on one.
Hey!
Come on!
A white light came out of the sword blade, and suddenly it was smashed together with the hammer from top to bottom. A circle of transparent ripples suddenly exploded between the two.
Where the ripples come, the ground gravel flies, the fracture of the green shrubs is cut.
As if there were some invisible blades that cut everything.
The old man's strength was astounding. He was able to beat Linming in a direct confrontation.
Lin was also surprised.
Knowing that to break the limit, has almost given up half of the human blood, to turn into the blood of the dragon.
His blood is almost equal to the power of a half-headed dragon.
And in that old guy can shake with him?
His mind was shocked, but his hands were still, and the giant sword was falling and falling and hitting the hammer.
As soon as they met, they knew each other was the only enemy they had ever seen.
The Old Man, who has been invincible in this evil world for hundreds of years, has never been surpassed by anyone.
Whether martial arts or physical power, he has reached the limits of what man can achieve.
But I didn't expect this man to be able to counter against him, and even to suppress him a little.
Linmore combined the soul of the numerous strongmen died and died, one combat experience is exceedingly rich, more because of the fusion of the soul fragments and mastered many sword techniques kill.
He had little opportunity to use this exaggeration of force because he had been able to deal with the battle easily by means of other forces.
But at this time his whole protective power is suppressed, and for a while does not want to expose himself to the bottom of the card, wants to know first how the bottom of the other.
It's just using your own martial arts.
Didn't you think this old man was blocked?
The two held heavy weapons flashing back to each other.
The giant sword and hammer hit each other against the shield, sending out a shock wave of destructive power.
Within a quarter of a few hundred meters, it became a dead zone.
CHAPTER 471
Ado looked at half the sealed at Frodo.
His sense of uncertainty grew.
It's just that premonition can't be said.
Now that is where they have been forced to go, whether they like it or not, under the guise of the so-called great man.
If he suddenly says he doesn't feel good and wants to quit, then there will be no end to it, no one knows.
A group secretly in the power of the hidden man, toward the sealed battlefield more and more.
I don't feel so dangerous from a distance.
But as soon as they came close they felt the danger of this battlefield.
Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak Shak
Different people's evil powers different people's will.
Powers determined by different wills are like soldiers fighting together.
Just a few hundred yards away from the battlefield, they can feel the ground shaking with one dense explosion.
The crying and the roaring of the monsters, like the waves of the sea, one after another.
Just standing on the edge of the battle, Adof felt some headache.
Not only him, but also others with soft legs and white faces.
Living in a peaceful environment without experiencing the battlefield, they suddenly faced this supernatural cruel war.
Looking at the edge of the battlefield, there were all kinds of broken limbs, blood and flesh.
The woman in her sleep couldn't help crying.
"Well, don't delay.
As long as we activate the ability of the sacred thing and then gather together is it not?
The old man who was in charge said quietly.
"Yes," he said.
After that soul will take over everything.
The voice of the great was again heard by the people.
"Well, let's start.
The old man turned and looked at the others.
Everybody heard the great and knew what to do, what to do.
Adoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudoudou
Let's start releasing our abilities.
It was only with this release that the uncertainty of his mind became clearer.
Kill!
Intotototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototo
After the swords collided, Lin's brutal and continuous movement, to the next pressure.
Come on!
The black giant under the old man suddenly heavy, crying, kneeling in front, into the sand.
Their Faces.
You know they've been fighting for at least three hours.
However, there is no physical exhaustion, but it seems that the greater the power, the stronger the fight.
Whatever wound is on the other, will be healed in a short moment.
Added to the heavy white armour, the defense is extremely difficult to break.
Even though he was a warrior, he had never seen a strongman who could hold such a high-strength fight for such a long time.
If he's young, maybe he'll stick for twice as long.
But now it's different.
He's old.
"It is a pity that the power of the moon suddenly disappeared.
Otherwise, I am far more than this.
He shakes back to the forest, then with the giant tiger away by tens of meters.
"May the moon?
Where do you wish the moon's power had gone? If it had not been for it, would I have ceased to be this power?
"Okay. Now you have to understand what that wish stone is for you to do.
He meant something.
The old man paused.
Look around from Lin's view.
Many of the survivors, who were still alive, jumped safely, and at this time were all over the wave, dead and wounded.
He suddenly felt wrong.
Or do you really think he is to cut me off? In other words, do you really think these people can kill me?
said Lin.
The old man noticed a little detail.
On some of the dead on the ground, the moon stone in the chest disappeared, disappeared mysterious.
Don't you say
He suddenly thought of a most terrible possibility.
"You guessed right," he said. "It's in the recovery that you've been given the power.
If I guessed correctly, these forces should have already merged with you.
The only way to regain power is to kill you.
Linming with a little of pity.
Older men also thought of this possibility.
It's just that's what he's been holding for hundreds of years, and he doesn't even want to think in that direction.
"You're very strong.
Even if there is no moon stone, it is not like anything.
There's only one person around me who can be compared to you, said Lin.
"So if you don't come under me, I will give you a longer life, and your reward is to fight for me."
The old man is really strong.
Beside Lin, that is, only the work of Xi can be compared with it.
Their weapons carried an unspeakable force of impact.
This shock is different from the giant's shock.
He is able to the power of throwing, hitting, hammering, etc.
Additionally, the elderly themselves seem to have mastered the ability to resist all kinds of energy resistance.
So, this guy is basically a strong and high-powered anti-magic fighter.
His power was too strong, causing the force field to be as thin as a bubble, and to break at the touch.
"And...
Before, it was just playing with you.
Lindsay threw away some of the cracked swords of the Divine Light, and reconciled them, reshaping them.
His scalp washed out slowly. Two sharp spiked horns were extended over his head.
The body also expands rapidly. at least half as big as the original body.
"Now. Enjoy the fight! "
He struck the old man with his sword like a flash of light, and struck the old man's shoulder.
The sword was so fast that the old man had not yet returned to God from the previous movement.
His powers have actually reached the point of approaching the sky.
But it is such a level, at this time in front of Linming too little to see.
His strength grew to an extent that I could not have imagined.
Most of the eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and-eighty-and
The speed and power of the sword has reached the limits of the air.
When the sword swings, too fast brings huge thunders, while accompanied by friction created flames and thunders.
It wasn't until the old man had his sword, that the sound of Lin's sword--when he was slain--had passed through his ears.
The old man and the giant tiger burst out with a big crack, and the giant sword was thrown hard into the sand under his feet.
He couldn't resist the blood from his mouth, which had been lost because of the evil intention of the moonstone before.
At this time, after the sword, it is even more difficult to follow.
So aren't you disturb?Maybe the moon stone? he laughed and wiped the blood out of his mouth.
"Naturally, I am the King of the Holy Spirit is the power of healing and saving of the living.
What could be disturbing?
Chapter 472
"The King of the Spirit..."
"The old man still had doubts.
But his chest is constantly trying to get away from his wish moon crystal, but compels him to make a choice at this moment.
In order to wish moonstone meaningless war death, or temporarily leave doubt, return to the other.
The answer is obvious.
Have you thought? Linz had seen his decision in the eyes of the old.
"Can you give me some time?" the old man laughed.
"Of course.
A good and capable person deserves to be treated.
Lin smiled.
There is no reason to fight between the two.
The Older is not hostile.
After Lindsay healed his wounds by the Divine Power, his body was given by the Divine Power's inherently powerful healing power.
It is also believed to be the King of the Holy Spirit.
The old man, named Nine, gave a detailed description of the desert.
A long time ago, there was a stone called the moon, which came down from heaven and taught a number of people a practice called the moon power.
Lin studied the practice of the will of the moon.
Then there was a crystal of the moon, which was a red stone engraved on the chest.
As he did not expect, the so-called wish stone crystal, is actually a part of wish stone itself.
He consciously absorbed the body of those who refined the life force.
With this crystal, Linz led the elders to the other places to find the initial landing place of the Moon.
At the end of the moon, there were many moonlight practitioners who had died without any fighting.
The Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon Moon
This made it possible for Nine to see the face of the moon. After the healing of Rincewind, he finally made a decision to lead the army of the Palace of the Evil, and to return to the moon.
The siege did not last long.
After thence, under his great fame and blood, there were still many bodies that had been pulled from the moon, and at last, the whole desert secret began to become, at an exaggerated rate, the belt of the Palace of the Evil One.
Despite his lack of moon crystals, Lin also gave him the seed of sacred power.
His soul was so strong that the moon could not be absorbed by the air, the practice of sacred power was just a thousand miles.
And the power in turn nourishes his aging flesh.
Although he lost the accumulation of the long, the characteristics of the sacred power, he was compensated in pure power and strength.
So power didn't fall too much.
There's nothing wrong with the rest of the rows outside the hanging-the rows outside the hanging.
After practicing sacred power, he really became another top strongman under Linzheng.
Thermal Palace had no reason to fight, and most of them retreated slowly.
With the support of the old warrior, the power of the black desert was fully mobilized.
Many of the weak who are unqualified to refine the moon crystals, are similar to the Nine, because the power is too strong, and can not be absorbed by the moon stone in the vacuum.
Everyone, under the fear of the enemy, automatically gathered under the Nine, became the subordinate power of the Palace of Evil.
They headed straight to the secret place of the wish moon - Black King.
Their intention to destroy the Moon is stronger than Lindsay.
After all, it's done to their lives.
In reality, after a few days of stagnation, the feud between Redon and Redon finally came to an end.
Redon was officially replaced by ancillary powers in Pluto.
The Gate is closed, and the outside plain is full of wrecks.
You can't see the bones, or the traces of the cloth before.
Everything turned into a huge change.
This land seems to have been completely covered by a thick red soil.
The red soil washed away all traces of this place.
There are evil powers that go beyond the black tide monster group, go to the heavens to check out the situation, but there is a maze blocked, no breathing fluctuation can enter.
The Great Magical Rudo is also missing.
There is speculation that seal may have been successful. There is also speculation that Frodo may have gone into hiding.
But anyway, the world finally calmed down temporarily.
The Secret.
Among the tall white tower, it belongs to the deepest of the ice and snow parliament.
At this point, the House has been completely turned into a dark hell of smoke and darkness.
A stone column from the ground, with dark red chains, tied to each crying red person.
These living people belonged to the evil powers before the tower.
They were not willing to surrender to Frodo, and Frodo did not care about the garbage, to surrender and waste his time.
Theory constructed it as a Pluto pillar to store energy by opening the Pluto channel here.
This war made it clear to him that attacking a secret was a bit of a problem.
So he decided to immediately open a channel, to project his part of the body to come down, again reinforced wave after wave.
But before doing so, let's deal with some of these unexpected surprises.
He stepped into the back of the Chamber, where there was a small resting place, reserved for the waiters.
It is now converted into a special test site.
In total six individuals with special powers in the body of ordinary human beings were caught on the edge of the battlefield.
He had just defeated the whole power of the heaven tower, and as a result he encountered a group of ghosts on the side, and released to him a lightly malicious little guy.
These men are indeed little men of his age, after all, not even his.
He was very interested in the strange power of the people.
So determined that they were not threatened, he easily defeated all the people, with the invasion of the heaven tower, and lost here.
Frodo took the eyes of the dead.
This is one of his special powers, which can be seen to some extent in the nature of his powers and in his special ability to follow his feet.
Their eyes were swept over several people.
Soon, the special power of one of them, let him a little.
"What is this?
Light?
The Power?
Frodo's eyes suddenly stayed on Ado.
He was attracted by some of the light that made him feel brilliant.
In the darkness, he stepped forward to the hold of the long-held divine deity.
Tell me what this is
He took hold of Adov's chin and passed through him with a psyche that made him awake.
Pluto has a special power as a Pluto high-ranking power, has the ability to inspire potential, temporarily return to light.
Chapter 473
Adolf was severely injured, and was hungry for a long time, and had no water for several days.
It's about to run out of light.
He didn't know why in the end, all the powers had come together, the so-called life and soul still didn't appear.
But anyway it was his choice. He didn't regret it.
"Hmm.
He pulled out a smile. He didn't want to answer.
"It's a bone."
Frodo admired.
"But it's a pity. The stronger the man, the faster he actually dies.
"Then you- kill me," said Adov calmly.
He had to go out without getting anybody tired.
Now that everything has come to a predetermined end, then everything really doesn't matter.
He's gonna die.
Then all the causes themselves, will not burden anybody, will not involve anybody.
"I'm sorry," said Frodo.
He released his hand and looked at the six gods who had been captured.
"A curse."
He raised his right hand.
"All order is the end of orderless chaos.
Behold, the shadow of glory, the land of desolation, in my name, behold, it is called.
A lot of black hair grew slowly in his hands.
Innumerable hairs like the darkest night, flowing to all the ground around the palace.
"He who speaks of thee is the voice of thee.
To offer sacrifice, to call me to sleep in the body of the great pillar of God.
Frodo laid down his hand, and the hairs of his hands were cut off, and he fell like an animal on all sides.
He slowed down to the six.
The Eye of Evil.
He changed his eyes again.
This is a special ritual eye specially used to receive the soul of the living creature.
It is possible to the soul of the income as a sacrifice, enlarge almost double the effectiveness.
He came to the first man, his eyes shining with triangular purple and black. He stared at his brow.
Ha Ha
Soon, a slight bubble of blue figures, slowly drifted out of the man, and became a long, long line, flying quickly into Frodo's right eye.
"First."
He continued to the second.
Soon another human soul was slowly taken out and flew into his right eye and disappeared.
And then the third.
She Bridge leaning on Ado and seeing Frodo's souls, she was suddenly frightened and dead.
She too was caught by the unknown for this call.
Because of the long rice has not entered, at this time, she has been all weak and unable to resist.
Soon, Frodo came before her, and the eyes of the soul of the captive were fixed on her.
All of a sudden he took a slight glance, and was attracted by Adov by the side.
He seemed to hes, but before he went, he stood in front of Adoff, and decided to absorb the somewhat doubtful man first, lest there be an accident.
Amorphic Capture Power slowly moves, Frodo's eyes release a strange field of power, surrounded by Adoof.
This force began to quickly penetrate the body of Adov and take his soul out of the body.
That's it.
Come on!
Suddenly a white light rose from Adoff.
The light was so pure, yet so glorious and holy, that in a moment the power of the taking of the soul was removed.
Feeling the power of taking, the white light seems to have been fluctuated, the horse covers all of Adolf.
"Well," said Frodo, "is there any power to resist the eyes of his evil spirit?"
He turned the eyes of the evil spirit, and looked at Adov.
"The camera!"
Strength increases. The time to cause the white light stimulation feedback.
A vague, strong, is slowly awakening from this light.
Is it you who defeated my disciple?
Who are you?
Frodo stared.
The other is able to show his will through pure power, which is not usually possible.
It's clear that guy in the white light isn't an easy guy.
"Me?
He's just a nameless guy.
consciousness in white.
"But since I woke up.
There's a sense there too.
"So you can defeat my disciple, but you can't kill him.
There are many failures in one's life. But if I don't die, I can give him another chance.
"Can't kill him?
Frodo laughed.
"This is the advice I give you," said the consciousness in white.
"In other people's lives, failing still has many opportunities.
But you are different. Since you met me, then you have only one chance to answer me.
"That's good.
Then my answer is yes.
Frodo reached out with a finger.
P P P P
His finger pointed at Adolf's eyebrow.
Suddenly, a darkness washed over Adoff's brain.
"That's my answer," he said.
"The Spirit!"
Suddenly, the power of the invisible soul beside him, increased and strengthened.
Therm began to pull out its pale blue transparent soul from Ado.
He's a g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g
He hasn't looked at the whole of humanity, or even at the consciousness that is hidden in an energy.
Along with the screaming, the blue soul seemed to be driven mad by two powers.
The power of the Holy Light is pulling him back into the body, and the power of the eyes of the evil soul is pulling him into the eyes.
Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good
We'll meet soon.
He looked deeply into Frodo's eyes, and the power of the Holy Light began to dissipate rapidly, which was only the part of the power that remained on him to protect himself, and which was naturally beyond Fro Frodo's own hands.
"I'm waiting for you here.
Frodo smiled, holding Adoff's soul, and his eyes gleamed with a deep purple line.
The Palace.
Lin was sitting on the throne. His hair was low, and he sat still.
Come on!
Suddenly he swept the little table in front.
The power of the fierce dragon flies upside down the wine and ice cream with the desk, blowing to the wall of the palace.
A dragon statue carved on the wall was broken neck, rolled to the ground, crushed stone spread to the ground.
"Devil"?
Frodo?
Oh Oh Oh Oh
He stood up, in a crowd of frightened waiters from kneeling down, stepped forward into the back of the Hall of the Sun.
Since he mastered the circle, he has been going by the wind and never encountered great setbacks.
This one made him feel a little inflated.
But at this moment, that Frodo's finger, let him re-experience the long-lost defeat.
He also lost his closest disciple forever.
It's his fault.
If he didn't show up, maybe Adolf wouldn't have been killed so easily.
The flame burned in my chest.
Linming entered the Yang Temple. To move the fairy king established here the scenery.
It's a special way to communicate with all commanders.
He just wanted to reach out to initiate the ritual, to inform all the commanders to come here, to prepare for the official step into reality.
But an even more insane thought suddenly form in his mind.
"Screening"
He reached a finger at the ground. Then a light red whirlwind came slowly to form.
Don't stop.
Lin moved one step in the form quickly disappeared in the whirlpool gate.
CHAPTER 475
A legend was born here.
History is lost here.
A huge black whirlwinds in the sky.
There is a huge black twisted pillar on the ground, where you can see the faces of people who have suffered.
Innumerable souls taken from other worlds.
Some of them are not.
But whatever race, after their death, once their souls have come here, they are destined not to be separated from the fate of feeding.
A giant black pillar connected with the sky, like a giant pillar supporting the heavens and earth, will make the whole world into a cave.
It is also called thermal world.
It is a huge world that exists for a long time to absorb many souls as nourishment.
For the soul of the world, whether the good soul or the evil soul, are to supplement their own good.
A black pillar covered the ground with black cracks.
One of the roughest piles.
Come on!
A giant black claws slowly out of the smoke pillar.
Li's claws had three sharp, rough claws, followed by a large, strong, grey arm, upper body, and a giant crocodile head.
Out of the smoke pillar came a giant crocodile up to a hundred meters.
It shimmered in its green pearls, following the subtle calls of consciousness.
A claw ripped out the space before, cut out a black crack, and walked in.
Frodo is about to summon more bodies?
"Laugh," I said. "I," said the witch, "I," said the witch. "I," said the witch. "I," said the witch, "I," said the witch.
Just as it was preparing to close the space crack, a clean white pillar descended from the sky, accurately falling beside this huge pillar.
It's right at the edge of the crack it's ripping.
The light column is as thin as a smoke column, as if it were a white pin nailed to the ground.
It's a lot smaller, but it's not too weak.
"Is this?
It was when witch Hilvis wondered. a low sounded from the column of light.
Ha!
The white column drops like ink into the water.
Among the countless rays, a pure white knight, full of armor, suspended in the column of light, slowly floating.
"Here is the great pillar of God, the place where many gods sleep.
Are you? The Magician, feeling that pure white light washed over everything, began to ask.
"I am the King of the Holy Spirit!"
The white knight's body suddenly expanded, two sharp spirals were born on his head, and an even more terrifying confusion of soul and power of endless confusion of holy light spread around.
These sacred lights and disturbing spirits, as if they were fleeing into a sheep's circle, where they were completely burning and plundering, without any resistance.
Come on!
The Holy Power of the Sea and the Chaos of the Spirit form over the rows, and the power of the rows explodes instantly, radiating to hundreds of meters around, turning hundreds of meters into a white cage.
This led to a convergence of the minds of the wizards who had disregarded their physical form.
Their intuition tells them that is the nature of the opposing force. Really, even if he is stronger than the opposing force, the end result may not be very optimistic.
The Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord Lord
Lin also looked up at this enormous thing up to several hundred meters.
Their shapes are different, but they are subtly autumn colours.
"I've never heard of the King of the Spirits, but there was once a group of evil spirits nearby.
Elves lived a long life and naturally heard of evil spirits.
"My powers have not yet been fully activated," said Lin, "and the magician of yours, Frodo, has killed my disciple, and taken his soul, while I am not prepared to do so."
"Mr. Frodo" ""Mr. Silvis laughed at once.
"It looks like you're going to find that guy's trouble too.
The Magician Frodo, there are many in the opposite of the pit.
How about that we don't have to do it together?
"Aheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadheadhead
It's also good that they are the top masters of manipulating the soul power, and the language aspect directly uses the soul power to communicate, without worrying about the language.
Otherwise he might really miss the important information here.
"That's right," said the Magician, "or why do you think there are so many magicians, that he's the one who can get out so quickly.
Among the great gods, he was guilty of a few, but the more enemies there were, the worse the confusion.
If they knew he was running out, they wouldn't have let him go.
"Isn't it?"
So you should know where the witch Frodo's body is?
"I don't know.
It would not have been possible for him to have lived so well for so many years if he had been easily known by other priests.
Hilvis laughed coldly, "Look at the fluctuation of your breath, should it be from the world of man? We must find another way to the world of man..."
I can open the way to the world.
Lin said quietly.
`But since you and I want to kill Frodo, what's your plan?
"There is a plan.
Frodo had too many enemies in the dungeon, so he had to find hundreds and hundreds of opportunities to escape from here.
This time he found the opportunity, we must kill the life, completely eradicate his soul.
So it's not easy to tell you.
Says.
"I understand.
Lin raised his head, but if I help you open the gates of humanity, I should be able to prove that I'm not an in-law of Falludor.
"That's possible," said the Master, "as long as you can open the human gateway and locate the Frodo body."
I've got another priest. Let's work together when it's time.
"It would be better if Frodo had his body fully summoned and worked together.
I want tos his soul, not leave a trace!
Lin said.
"But then you must bring us into the world first.
Otherwise, when the time comes, our power will not be enough to completely kill Frodo.
Even if he beat, he's a magician, and he's very good at escaping.
There can be no less relaxed.
Hilvis.
"Yes," said Lin, angry on the surface, but with no fluctuation in his heart.
This big chunk appears to want to kill Frodo but also to get into the realm of enjoyment.
What he didn't realize was that's not the most important thing about the human world.
The most dangerous is the black tide.
Dust World Pluto and Black tide are completely two different levels of threat.
It's just that's what it's all about.It's just that on the surface of the dust world, the psychic and the dead air are very similar to the black air of the black tide, but they're actually two different kinds of forces.
Chapter 805
"In the East?"
Zhou had some hesitation, because neither the principal nor the teacher had warned the new students not to come near the Eastern School District, and they had not given any specific reasons, but from the tone of their speech they could hear that the Eastern School District was dangerous.
"You have a deep misunderstanding of the Eastern School District, which is almost the same as here, except that the two School Districts are managed completely differently, and they live in real terror, and you live in real happiness.
Chen looked into Zhou's eyes and said, " Compared to you, they are actually closer to hope, because they at least know who they are and know how to get out of it.
Chen didn't deceive Zhou, either the Eastern or the Western students, they were all trapped in this school.
Their memories were altered, repeating the life of the black behind the scenes, and the good and bad students of the Eastern School know to look for the dead, to think of a way to leave.
"Eastern students are closer to hope. But I have heard that only unwanted garbage from the West is sent there."
Zhou has been talked about,but he still has some uncertainty in his heart.
No matter what the criteria are, any school that treats its students as garbage must be a garbage school.
Chen reaches for the high wall between the two schools: Do you know why that wall exists?
"Why?
"Because schools are afraid of losing control, they re-form humanity in all kinds of ways, but they forget humanity is the most complex thing in the world.
Things have happened, and whatever you forget, the wounds that are left will be stamped on your heart.
Nothing remembers, doesn't mean they don't exist, so some of the school's plans are destined to fail.
Some of the members didn't understand why she said this, but they felt that she had something to say.
Their curiosity wasted, and Chen continued to tell them the truth of the school, and finally succeeded in attracting the interest of the members of the society.
"So we're gone now? I really don't believe there's going to be a painting room I dreamed of," said Zhou.
It's not the time.
Chen looked back at the darkness of the 413 dormitory still sleep, but his body has changed greatly.
If you look closely, you will find that Chen's shadow is different from that of other people, black as ink, as if all the light that shines there would be swallowed up.
It looks like it's gotten much stronger.
It's a good thing for Chen, when he wakes up, Chen will lead the students back to the Eastern school district again to look for the bad guys.
Doing so would strengthen one's own strength, and it would be possible to stir up the school's dead water, and to cover up another "murderer" in the college.
"It's still a time for me to prepare as much as I possibly can for myself before my master finds out about my little bug.
Chen turned to Wang, the story of the other three members of the society he had all understood, only the first to enter the society lame boy: "The next place we go is the dormitory Wang.
Go to my dorm?Wing's reaction was a little strange, and he shook his hands.Well, there's nothing good about my dorm.
When you say this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chen Jiang gave a gentle hug to Wang's shoulder: "Why don't you let us go?
"I...
Wang thought for half an hour about what to say, and finally turned his eyes to the other direction: nothing, let's go straight.
"All right.
Wang lived in the 413 bedrooms of the West school district, Lins lived in the 413 bedrooms of the East school district.
Their number was exactly the same, but in the 413 bedrooms in the West, there were students in the other beds, and in the East, there were only people in the fourth bed, and the other beds were empty.
Don't tell anybody about the secrets of our society, let's be as low as possible, and there are teachers like me here, and there are teachers who don't speak as well.
"I don't have much time left," he said. "I'll go to the 413 room," he said.
There are four dormitory buildings in the West. The number of students is several times greater than in the East West. It is not yet time to turn off the lights.
"It's about the same as the East. "
Chen, acting very naturally, followed by four students, entered the first building.
The door of the little house of the host was closed, but the window was open, and there was a mother of more than fifty who was humming, and she seemed to be in good mood.
A notice was placed next to the small window, which stated that students were forbidden to use electrical power in the dormitory, and that students were forbidden to cook in the dormitory themselves.
"I remember a good copy of the announcement in the dormitory building of the Eastern School District -- there was a recent incident where students were forbidden to go outside after the lights went out.
A wall, is almost two worlds, like inside and outside.
Passing through the corridor, Chen and several members of the community came to the 413 dormitory door.
"This dormitory has nothing to do with other dormitories.
King opened the door, and when he entered the room, all the others in the room seemed to do their own thing, as if he were not there, and no one spoke to him.
After a few steps into the king's city, the boy who slept next to the door suddenly lifted the mosquito net and stared at him: "How many times have you said? Come in and close the door.
It's hard for a boy to say something. He doesn't know why he seems to hate Wang.
"He doesn't shut the door because there is someone in the back, and if you need an apology, there are a few of us who can apologize for you, but we don't know what kind of an apology you need."
The Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed Bed
"Mr. White, this is the fourth bed, because there is no one to stay, so we are going to put the luggage.
Wang pointed to the fourth bed, on which several luggage boxes were thrown, in which only his luggage was placed under his own bed, and all the others threw the garbage and luggage to the fourth bed.
Chen is very familiar with the fourth bed, he himself lay on the fourth bed of the East school district.
On the way to the fourth bed, although there were no people, there were beds and sheets, but the beds were now spoiled by luggage and garbage.
Zhang : Let's Get a Certificate (Free Birthday Edition)
The clouds over the city, the sky seems to reach.
Liman stood by the window, watching the rain fall through the glass, leaving a trail.
The clock tied on the wall, and the dull time flowed quietly in the little house.
"Five to thirty," said Liman, leaning over, and moving the meat from the window to his desk.
She put the card of the marriage registration on the table in the drawer, and looked at the big letters on the wall-lawful administration, civil service.
"It's raining so hard today," he said. "No one should be registering for marriage."
Liman hum, began to clean, in the empty marriage register only she, beside the divorce registration staff already fifteen minutes before work.
Hello, is it a marriage certificate? The door was pushed open, and a sound of a mature, magnetic man came from the door.
Sounds so good, people must be pretty.
Liman looked up and saw a man dressed in a black rain suit standing at the door of the marriage registration.
He looked ordinary, but he had an unspeakable spirit.
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
"Well, I've made an appointment online for today.
Let me look. What's your name?
"Chang".
Liman entered two words into Chen's computer, and indeed saw his appointment application: "I'm about to go to work, let's go quickly, do you have everything with you?
"It's all here.
The man opened his backpack and began looking inside.
Liman heard a cat call, she looked a little curiously into the man's backpack.
It was packed with a reading machine, a comic book, a doll, a pen, and a big white cat.
"I'm sorry," the man told Liman. "It's all here. I've seen the women's families, and they're very happy with me.
"It looks like you've done a lot of preparation.
When Liman had the information of the man and was ready to start the registration of the woman, she suddenly found that the magnetic strip on the identity card was no longer used, she looked at the name on the woman's identity card, and suddenly realized something.
The man in front came to register to get married, prepared all the information, even brought a cat, but only saw his girlfriend.
"Wait, sir."
Liman stopped his work. Are you going to get married?
"Yeah.
"What about your girlfriend? How do you get together?" Liman laughed bitterly.
The clock tied on the wall, and the more the rain came, the man held his lips, and looked up to Liman, and she came and stood behind me.
The rain fell on the windows, and the air in the room gradually solidified.
Don't joke, sir,the marriage must be done by both sides.I can't help you with this.
Liman covered her chest, she didn't know why suddenly a little breathless.
She's really here. She's everywhere I'm.
The man's eyes were clear, and his tongue was a little stiff.
Looking at the man's seriousness, Liman holds a card that had been demagnetized, she suddenly thought of a possibility.
Turn over the woman's address book, on the page with the woman's name, covering the police station's declaration of death, the time of death is still years before.
"Mr.
Liman wanted to say, but looked at the man's stubborn look, some emotion.
Looking over the man's backpack, Liman looked at one of the items in the bag.
Are these things that girl used? Are these things kept hidden? Are these the memories of the two of them? Is this the cat that the girl girl was raising?
For a moment, Liman understood why a man would bring a lot of stuff to the marriage register, and why a man would say a woman has always been with him.
Liman with the girl's ID, she didn't know what to say, to comfort men, or to tell men the cruel truth.
Liman opened his lips slowly, but he did not say anything, she looked at like a childlike man, with a complicated feeling.
She tried to keep her smile: Sir, you must love her. How do you know her
"It was she who followed me. The first love letter I ever received was from her.
The man washed his eyes as if he were remembering his past: The first date we had was with the school.
A::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
"The private college in West, where she had hers and her past, I stood in the hall where she had practiced dancing, leaning against the mirror, leaning against her, and we were talking to each other.
Liman listened quietly and a picture appeared in his mind.
On a quiet night, the two in the abandoned mother school remembering the past, once the college was so lively, now only the two of them, back to back, cling to each other, what a beautiful love!
"The second appointment was in a mental hospital, and she was dressed in a red dress, and she was beautiful.
"A mental hospital?"
"Because of my parents, that day I..."
I'm sorry.
Before the man finished, Liman apologized, she did not like to uncover the scars of others, maybe the parents are another pain in the man's heart.
"The third date was in a building, and I would have stuck the unhappy man in the elevator, and given him a life-long lesson.
You can really love your girlfriend. I think she will be very happy when she knows about this.
She was right next to me.
The gentle man remembered the elevator wrapped in black hair.
That must have been romantic.
Leeman thinks the man in front of him is just a boyfriend.
"The fourth appointment was in the morgue of the Faculty of Medicine, and she was injured, but she didn't tell me, she sat quietly with me, as if she had been sneaking at me.
The man's voice was very good, the dust with the ripe rhythm, he remembered the past, the lightness of the feeling even let Liman unconsciously ignore the underground mortuary, the special meeting place.
"The fifth date was on the roof of a small town, and it was like today, and it was raining outside, and I was with her.
Compared to the abandoned school, mental hospital, and underground mortuary, the normal date for Liman was a little uncomfortable: Did you meet her that day?
The man nodded gently.I stood at the top of the town, crying out to the strange world.I don't believe there is anything more romantic in this world than a lifetime.
"Wow!"
Liman heard many stories, but not Chen's story shocked, perhaps because she saw the death certificate on the homepage, already knew the reason for the result.
"Then..."
"She's asleep," Chen said, "I've been waiting for her for a long time.
Their death proved that moment like a needle pierced Liman's heart, her tears unconsciously poured into her eyes.
Lower her head, Liman dressed as she was looking for something, while the computer was covering her face, sneaked a tear, the end of the story she had already known.
No one talked in the room, and after a long time the man broke down, and his hands were placed gently on the empty seat next to him, as if there were sitting his girlfriend: "Our sixth date..."
It doesn't matter what the man says. Liman knows that the man is trapped in a cage called love after his wife's affair. He thinks his girlfriend is still in the room.
Because of deep love, refuse to believe the fact that the other has left.
Liman wanted to tell the truth, but she really didn't dare to tell.
She put her face behind the computer, entered all the information on the application, she wanted to help the man in front of her complete a dream, and when she pressed the confirm key, the computer played out a different page of home registration information.
The girl died many years ago and there is no such person in the census.
Reality As a pool of ice water washed over Leeman, she looked at the man's face, which was caught in memories, and bit her lips: "Sir, we don't have enough data here, the system is upgrading, and we can't help you for the time being, and you'll come in a week."
Leeman wants to help the man in sight, even if he himself does a similar, not legal, little red book.
"Well, that troubles you.
The man slowly got up and went out, and when he came to the door, he suddenly took off his raincoat and put it over his head, as if there was another man standing beside him: Zhang Ya, don't go too far from me, it's raining.
Liman saw clearly in the room, that man under the raincoat, except for himself, there was no more.
Looking at the man's distance, Liman wiped his eyes: "Maybe this is love, love for you, loyalty to you, heart for you, end for you."
Chapter 806 Possible "gates"
There are so many things lying in the bed, and if the student of the fourth bed came back, where would he sleep? Chen seemed to be saying to himself, Would he sleep in the bed of the others?
Since he entered, the students in the 413 dorm have looked at him intentionally. After all, it is difficult not to pay attention to the person who entered the room wearing the school work clothes.
You're a school teacher A tall, thin, student sitting on the bed opposite the fourth bed, wearing thick glasses, looked a little strange.
Put on bed sheets and cushions, and you say this bed can't be used for people? Chen smiled and looked at the thin student. Maybe you just can't see him.
Chen, standing beside the fourth bed, carried all the above luggage to the ground.
"Hey! Don't disturb our stuff! "The mosquito-the man at the door looked out again.
"I'm saving you. This bed has its own owner. He's been in this school.
Chen has found many things in the 413 bedrooms of the Eastern school district, and he also expects the 413 bedrooms of the West school district.
Do you know the legend of the fourth bed of the 413 bedroom?The glassman stretched his face.Are you telling the truth that we were there to scare the king of a city
It's true, and you'll know when you meet.
After leaving the blanket, Chen took off the pillow and the mask, to make sure there was nothing hidden inside.
"You say that's where the fourth bed is, and you're just moving around with it?"The thin student put down his glasses, and he didn't like Chen, perhaps because Chen helped Wang speak, which was the exact opposite of the atmosphere in their bedrooms.
"I don't care, I don't live in this bedroom anyway.
Angry at him,,,the first to look for you.
Chen's way of speaking is very different from the people's teachers in the minds of some students, of course he himself is a fake, does not care about these.
Lifting off the bed below the bed sheet, Chen no longer fight with the people in the dormitory, the line is stuck on the bed sheet.
There were five fingerprints left on the side of the wall.
Isn't that's also your evil play? Chen grabbed the blood fingerprint with his fingernails and put it down on the tip of his nose and smelled it, which was supposed to be a solid blood.
Why is there blood on the fourth bed?
Teacher,What is that? Because the place of the blood fingerprint is very hidden, King one city also just seen.
"I've studied painting and I'm very familiar with this smell.
Chen looked at the other students in the dormitory: "Someone wants to make a bad play.
He didn't go on the topic, took out Linth's cell phone lighting, and looked down at the sheet.
It's very similar to a scene in the East. There's something written under the bed.
Tiny Words should be printed a little with a knife.
Why doesn't everybody talk to me?
Why is everyone ignoring me?
"I didn't lie to them! There really are ghosts! I really saw ghosts in the toilet!"
It's dangerous! Why don't people believe me?
Chen, looking at these words, felt some familiar, he continued to look down, found a more familiar name.
"I swear to myself," said Lin, "it's a real mess in the bathroom!
"I know everybody hates me, wants to joke with me, I am happy, I know, but the toilet is really crazy! I really didn't lie this time!
Every word on the board was very useful, and in the middle some of the marks of blood, seemed to the engraver accidentally cut off the hand.
These are also left by Lin, but his descriptions do not seem to be the same as those in the school's notebooks!
Chen was very sensitive to find the problem, the diary said that Lin thought very skinny, like to make fun of others, finally the whole class couldn't accept him to the toilet, together to make a joke, finally to fright him dead.
But there's something else under the sheets, and Lin thought she wasn't scared by her classmates, she actually saw something in the toilet.
Thinking terrified, Chen's eyes shrinking, he now doesn't know exactly who to believe.
There was no doubt that was the owner of the fourth bed, whether in the East or the West.
"If this bedroom had all that was in memory, then the words under the bed sheet would have been true, but Lin thought was dead, and how could he come back and write under the bed?"
Only the fourth bed had no one in the room, as was the case at the time.
Lynce was frightened, and the fourth bed was empty, and there were five others in the bedroom.
Lin thought the toilet was a big thing, so after he died he ran back to the wind and left all kinds of marks, but no one cared.
"No wonder he would write such a sentence, and become a ghost, and a living man of course can not see.
Chen didn't know if the five people in the bedroom were the five people who lived with Lin thought at first, or if they were not, then they would be very unlucky.
In the East, every living person who has just entered the school is called Lin, the name of which implies uncertainty and curse, and is targeted by all evil spirits.
But thinking in a different direction, Li wants to graduate and needs to replace the dead, from the point of view of Li Li, Lin thought the name also represents hope.
It's getting more and more interesting, the curse in the eyes of the living, the hope in the eyes of the wicked, what has Lin thought done at all in this school?
Chen can be sure that Lins had a deep connection with the school, and that even if he was not the owner of the school, he must have had a connection with the owner of the school.
"If only I could find him, or find the last one," he said.
Chen continued to watch, the words on the floor more and more force, engraved the person's mentality from anxiety gradually to despair.
"I really see a ghost. Would you believe me once?"
Listen to my voice I'm here!
"Well, I don't expect you to believe me, I just want you to never go to that toilet on the top of the building! Remember! Never go!
"It's over, they're still running out..."
This is where the information under the sheet stops, Chen can feel the desperation of the engraver from word to word.
"The toilet at the top of the teaching building? "Where did Lin think he was killed?"
The Ghost School scene is the most complex, the largest, and the most difficult task he has ever done, and the various clues and riddles are intertwined, as if it were an invisible mist.
It is not possible to a single sex, Chen can only start from the most fundamental point.
There must have been a pusher, assuming that pusher was Linth, and the door he pushed out was most likely to be the toilet at the top of the teaching building!
Chapter 807 Black
Chen's eyes became bright, and he found a very critical information.
"The Ghost School is a four star scene, I have never touched four stars, and all the experience before is not applicable here, want to know more, only go to see it yourself."
Chen didn't know how long a man's attachment would take to make such a big nightmare that he couldn't even do it with Dr. and Zha.
"Maybe there was a door in the toilet itself, which was accidentally opened when the students caught Lin.
Chen also had a door in his own ghost house, and he has not been able to get close to it, so he guessed Lin thought he might have been in the same situation then.
He just avoided the door, and Lin thought he had opened it.
"No matter what the truth, the toilet on the top of the teaching building must be seen! "
There was no indication on the sheets that toilet was in the east or in the west.
"Let's get out of here first, and you'll go to the test room with me," said Chen.She's already gained enough under the sheets, and to stay in 413 is meaningless, but it will attract the attention of students in the building.
"But we're not just...
King wanted to say something, but was interrupted by the torch, he gently dragged King King's arm.
Listen to the teacher where he let us go.
Chen said that was just playing the next game. The 413 students had a very bad attitude towards them, saying they were not sure that they were just going to the next step.
Let's get something and come back.
Thermomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomomo
After leaving the boys' apartment building, Chen saw many people running towards the experimental building, where it seemed to have gone wrong.
Zhong just flipped over to understand the anatomy, the class teacher would have handled himself, it is necessary to surprise so many people? Chen is very curious about the situation there, but also just curious, now in the past is self throwing the net, the best choice is to avoid them.
Teacher, are we going to the laboratory? We have just come back from there.
Go to the first classroom and we'll go and see before the school reacts.
Chen has been changing places, even the people of the school have come to search, can only follow behind him ashes.
As time passed, fewer and fewer people were on campus.
Have you heard any strange talk about toilets here? Chen went and asked, Have you been to the top of the teaching building
No. Several students shook their heads.
This school looks normal, but there is danger everywhere, and after you get there, you must listen to my command.
Chen-They went around the teaching building, the teaching building in the east school district is very fancy, three buildings behind, each building has four floors.
"Your school seems to love the number four.
At this time there were no more students, the classroom was black, only the corridor was lit.
"It's the first time I've been in a classroom at this late hour.
Wang's walking was slow, and as soon as he approached the teaching building, his expression became very unnatural, seeming to have come from within to the place.
Wang's changes Chen's attention, the lame boy seems to have encountered some very unpleasant things in the classroom.
Follow me, and let us go straight to the top, no matter what we see in the other classrooms.
Before entering the classroom, Chen looked at the surrounding environment, each classroom has two stairs on the left and on the right, and the toilet is near the left stairs.
Zhou was completely unable to understand Chen's behavior, each step of the other seems to have been thought through, but if you think about it, you will find that the half-money relationship between each other is not useful, but Chen's appearance is of course deep and unpredictable, one can't hate to lift his skull to see what is inside.
"Don't get out of the team," said Zhang. "I'll get out of the team," he said.
Come on, it's a community.
Zhong's eyes were red, and he was eight feet tall, holding a pink girl's phone, and he had no sense of contradiction.
"I'm really crazy," he said. "I'm going to come with you to the lecture hall to find out about the supernatural.
Zhou unwillingly entered the stairs, few did not stop, a breath ran to the top.
The classroom is very quiet, and the day is just two extremes.
"I and Zhang torch forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward forward
" Teacher, can you not go in..."
Wang stood by Chen, his face pale, cold sweat flowing down his cheeks, his eyes constantly moving: I thought of a very bad thing, that thing happened here!
"What is it? " Chen was the first time that Wang expressed such an expression.
"I just remembered in secret that I was involved in that thing, that I was forced into it, that I didn't get into the toilet, and that I survived, and those who got into it all died.
Wang began to speak, he with a cry.
Everyone who entered this toilet was dead. Chen touched Wang's hand.You're just a newborn.How can you remember this toilet?
"I don't know; I didn't mean it!
Teacher, let's go! Don't open that door!
"I've come here and I won't give up.
Chen took the king's hand and pushed the toilet door out with force.
Don't! Don't push the door!
In the Scream of the King, Chen opened the door of the toilet, he looked inside the toilet.
There was a rubber face on the ground, painted on the walls with blood fingerprints and the five organs of the person, and entered it as if were being stared at from every side.
Lin thought was caught here.
Chen picked up the rubber face and looked at it, determined that there was no danger, and put it into the backpack.
He proceeded slowly and took a few photos from Lin's cell phone as he passed through the first passage of the toilet.
Everything is fine in the toilet, no stranger.
There doesn't seem to be any problem, but I always feel a little wrong.
Chen looked at the close door, unconsciously pushed, the door is still.
"Is there anyone inside?
He bent to look at the gap below the wall, where there was a pair of black leather shoes.
Chapter 808
There's someone in the room!
Seeing the black shoes, Chen recalled the white teacher of the east school district, the other one wearing such a pair of pure black leather shoes.
Don't come here first.
Chen took two steps back, stretched Lin's cell phone into the gap, and quickly took a photo.
Looking down at his cell phone, Chen didn't appear to be worried about anything, only a pair of leather shoes, didn't hide "people".
Linth's cell phone can take a picture of a ghost and something special, and there's nothing in the picture that says there's only one pair of shoes in the room, but if there's no one in the room, how's the door locked?
The bathroom door only locked from inside, and the position of the black shoes, standing in the same way as inside, unlike from outside locked in.
"Teacher, are you mistaken? Who would go to the toilet on the top floor of the classroom in the evening?
Zhong's memories were relaxed in his mind, and he remembered something that was vague and could not be explained clearly, but that did have an effect on him, causing him to see changes that no one had noticed, for example, he began to distance himself from the other members of the society, and he preferred to stay with Chen, and Chen seemed to be of the same sort as him.
"You stay here, and if anyone comes near, let me know at once."
Chen used force to shake the shutter door, using violence to open it.
Many faces were painted in the narrow space, standing inside, as if were being stared at by many.
Why put a pair of leather shoes?
Chen didn't find anything unusual in the first row, he came to the second row, with previous experience, this time he took out the cell phone to shoot the row.
The photograph shows a pair of shoes in the second compartment as well, except that they are not black leather shoes, but an old blue sneakers.
Their positions are the same. What is the point of this?
Chen looked at the previous six intervals, each of which had a pair of shoes, all of which were men's shoes, had ball shoes, had travel shoes, had flat shoes, all had different scales, should belong different people.
"The first pair of black leather shoes are very similar to the white teacher shoes should be worn by adults, and the other five pairs of shoes are worn by students, does each pair of shoes represent a person?
Lin was initially caught by the whole class. Isn't the owner of the shoes the one who was most hostile to Lin Lin?
The biggest difference between a ghost and a living person is that they are composed of resentment and negative emotions, and the adjectives of understanding and kindness are completely out of touch with them.
No matter what a man was before Lin, in the moment when he became a wicked, his mind and body must be swallowed up by hatred, which is one of the wicked's obsessions, which is the foundation of his existence.
Capture their own people trapped in a chamber with their own companions, to Chen's understanding of the wicked, they probably do such things.
Teacher! Someone is coming over to the teaching building! Zhou, with the help of Wang, stood at the toilet door and shouted to Chen: They seem to be coming over to the experiment building!
"Coming for us?" Chen grabbed his time to the last door, and he consciously took out his cell phone to take a picture, but was surprised to find that the door of the seventh door had been removed.
The Seventh Door According to Chen's previous guess, the door related to Lin thought was most likely to appear in the toilet, but he did not find it in the toilet.
"Calm down," he said.
Chen, with a slight bite of his tongue, knew that the people downstairs would need some time to get upstairs.
When Chen touched the door frame, he found that the axle of the seventh door had been broken.
He looked down into the seventh compartment, where there were no shoes, only two red shoes.
These two shoes are like a man walking outside the door.
"If every shoe represents a person, then did the last man in the ward run out?" Chen looked around, not knowing if it was psychological or for any other reason, as if the ugly old men on the wall had come to life, and their expressions had changed from what they had just seen.
"All despair and negative emotions in the West are transported to the East West, where the real 'blood gate' is estimated to be the toilet at the top of the East East School's teaching building.
There was a problem that had not been solved, and there was a new problem. Chen's forehead turned blue, and he bit his tongue to keep himself awake.
Teacher! They're upstairs! Let's find a place to hide!
"It's very strange to walk" Chen immediately realized the strangeness, and greeted the torch and Zhu Long to run out of the toilet "Where are they from on the floor?"
"The stairway near the toilet!"
"Okay, let's go down the other side!Be careful not to be seen by them!" Chen had no intention of hitting the other side for a while, and ran down the first floor, but when he passed by King's town, he suddenly stopped.
Their eyes shrinked, and their eyes fell on King's shoes.
Blue sneakers?
Wang is now wearing shoes on his feet and shoes in the second room of the toilet!
"The shoes in the toilet are all men shoes.
When Chen thought about it, he suddenly found the shoes in the toilet were identical to the shoes of the 413 students in the bedroom.
"There are six in the 413 bedrooms, and there are seven separate toilets on the top floor of the teaching building, and six separate toilets on the top floor of the teaching building, and one separate toilet with black leather shoes, representing the teacher, is just enough for seven.
Chen with a frowning:
"Why did Lins hate his roommates? Didn't he just run back to his bedroom to remind his roommates not to come near the toilet?"
Chen had a lot to think about: The East is a mess, the West is more like a souvenir in a glass bottle, and has been stuck in the admission reports for a few days, repeatedly, to know the truth, you have to compare things to the same scenes in two schools.
"The West is too perfect to be true. It's like a child's dream, but the East West is much more real than that.
Chen's eyes shifted from Wang's shoes, and he had decided to take everyone to the Eastern School District.
"Now I have no choice but to look for memories in dreams and to look for truth in reality.
CHAPTER 8 9 They Forced Me!
Those who had run toward the experimental building had entered the stairs, they seemed to have noticed something, came straight to the top toilet, there was no stop in the middle.
Come on!
Chen directly back to Wang, several people quickly ran through the long corridor, came to the other side of the corridor.
They hid in the stairs, holding their breath.
Why did you stop, Mr. White?
"You are looking at the entrance to the third floor, and I am standing on the side of the fourth floor, and I am sure that when they are all on the fourth floor, we will go down again. " Chen was very brave, and he stood directly on the side of the corridor, separated from the long corridor, and looked at the toilet with his dark eyes.
"But..."
Do as I say.
Chen left alone at the entrance to the right on the fourth floor, looking at the left side of the building.
About ten seconds later, he heard the sound of footsteps in the left hallway, and then several men in white appeared on the fourth floor.
What a strange costume? Whole body white? Even shoes white?
There were three men upstairs, all dressed in white, and there was another unusual place, where these guys had scars on their faces.
Not one or two, but like a torch, the whole face burned, looking a little scared.
"They're the administrators of the school?" Chen, looking at them as they entered the toilet, led the other students downstairs, perfectly avoiding them.
Teacher, where are we going next?
"Look for a chance to the East."
Chen's voice wasted, and the people in the white dress brought him a lot of pressure.
"No, why are you so nervous? Like we're doing something weird."
Zhou looked at the nervous Chen and other members of the society, some of them silent: "We are school students, white teacher and school teacher, even if seen by the school, it is not enough to say a few words about us, to pay a lot more for the laboratory's anatomy, and not enough money.
"You still think we are caught, but will be criticized by the school?" Chen stared into Zhou's eyes.
"You'll understand when you get to the East. "
Chen took the students away from the teaching building, along the quiet road slowly near the gym next to the teaching building.
Teacher, aren't we going to the East? What are you doing in the gym?
Find the tools,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chen opened the door of the gym and found many ropes for jumping.
Teacher,these men seem to have come toward us! There was a sound outside the door, and he saw a few white shadows running out of the classroom toward where they were.
How do they know we're in the gym? If it's an accident for the other person to go to the top of the classroom, how do they know I'm in the gym?
Chen had a bad feeling, he pulled the backpack lock, because he had loaded too many things, the backpack looked very drum, can only take in his hand.
"The gym is big enough for them to search for a while.
Chen, carrying his backpack, and then to the king's city, waved: "Come, I will follow you."
Chen had a good intention, but Wang refused this time, and he shook his head, and his eyes were filled with fear, like a child who had made a nightmare: Teacher, I am afraid, I have heard someone cry my name, and the people behind me, I have heard their voice!
When did you hear someone shouting your name? Chen didn't give the king a chance to resist. Time was tight, and he couldn't delay.
Teacher!These men are coming to me!You take me, they will surely find me!
You're my student. just answer my question.
Chen, though he was very curious about what Wang said.
"When I was taken to the top of the teaching building, I suddenly felt uncomfortable, and I wanted to cry, and the corridor was familiar to me, and it seemed that something very bad had happened there.
Wang's eyes were red, like a fish thrown to the shore, even breathing became difficult.
Are you not a newcomer? How do you feel familiar with that corridor?
"I don't know, but sometimes when we go to a strange place, we feel like we've been there before, and that's what I feel like now.
The voice of the king of the city, and his face was white.
"What's with that sound?What did he say to you?"
"I started feeling uncomfortable when I just saw the corridor, and when we got to the toilet door, I suddenly had a picture in my mind.
Wang took a deep breath and paused for a long time before he said, It seems that a long time ago, when I came to this toilet, I was responsible for bringing a very important person into the toilet, and his thin body was standing in the toilet, and the toilet was filled with all kinds of monsters!
Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang
"Yes, that person seems to be my best friend, and I understand that feeling, because few people are willing to be friends with me, but he is an exception.
Wang hit his head hard, and his memory seemed to begin to relax: "When we came to the toilet, I remembered his voice, and he called me by name, and I could be sure that he was, but I couldn't remember who he really was!
Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't He Isn't
"I didn't mean, they forced me! I'm sorry! We're still the best of friends!"
Calm down!
Wang suddenly collapsed, which no one thought, and he would cause more trouble, Chen decided to throw him down, a hand cut to his neck and neck artery.
"Mr. White" Several other students were shocked.
Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu
Chapter 810 The Other Side of the Wall
Looking at the confused city, Chen's heart could not recover for a long time, he got an important message from the city's just said.
The One Who Induced Lin thought was King!
"I didn't expect the most important people to be around me.
Chen is lucky that even when he enters the world behind the door, he still maintains the good nature, he has just contacted the king of the city, not thinking too much, only because he sees the person alone, wants to help the person to change the situation.
Indeed he did, and Wang has now many new friends, and these friends will not deceive him or discriminate against him.
Chen, through what Wang said when he was mad, probably made it clear what was going on.
Wang and Lins lived in 413 bedrooms, both of whom were not attracted to people for any reason.
Because of their different personalities, they treat their classmates differently.
Wang chose to endure in silence. Lin thought of all kinds of things to bring attention.
These two men should not be considered friends, but are taken together by the deceivers.
The students hated Lin, decided to dress up as a ghost, caught Lin Lin in the toilet on the top floor of the teaching building, in order to retaliate against him.
In order to succeed in deceiving Linth, they found a good relationship with Linth. Chen didn't know how to convince Linth, but he knew that the end result was that Linth agreed to the students.
The king has his own trouble, but the man who pushed Lin thought to the cliff is he.
"Race up! Let's get rid of the ones behind before the king wakes up."
Chen was very cautious, and he went to several places, and found that the white man had not followed.
The atmosphere in the West area gradually becomes abnormal, the stranger wearing white clothes gradually increases, Chen no longer stops, leads the community members to the garbage disposal center.
"Mr. White, are those in white dresses also school teachers? How have I never seen them? And why are they after us?"
"They're not teachers, they're the administrators who keep the order in the West, and the reason they've been chasing us...
Chen will lay a lost king on the grass, "because of him, and for you."
"We?"
"Yes, this school is not as simple as you think. If it's more like a human brain, the West is the place where the good emotions are handled, and the negative emotions and the garbage are handled by the East."
Chen uses a common metaphor to explain: "The West School District has only good memories, and all the garbage is sent to the East School District, but how can people have only good memories?"
"So we forgot a lot of memories?" Zhang is very smart, Chen has not finished, he has understood Chen's meaning.
"Yes, your memories are filled with despair. These things are seen as garbage by the West, and once your memories are relaxed or awakened, they will send them to the East."
"You know the truth, now you are willing to continue to look for your memory," Chen said very seriously.
"I will."
Zhong agreed without hesitation: "It's so hard to remember something that happened, and I'm going to go crazy, and I'd rather remember it all."
"I'd like to know what I've lost, what I've missed, what I've missed, what I've missed, what I've missed, what I've missed, what I've missed, what I've missed, what I've missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't missed, what I haven't
Like a monster.
Touch the scars of the torch finger, the eyes complex, do not know what to think.
"You're really crazy," said Zhou, like a caged rat, walking back and forth on the ground.
"No rejection," he said.
Chen raised the King of the ground: "In fact, there is a good thing about going to the Eastern School District now, that our people want to send us to the Eastern School District, but they don't think we've gone to the Eastern School District.
What's the difference?
"Let's go past ourselves and still look like people, and if they catch up and pass on, then you're afraid of forgetting more.
"The East School District is not as scary as you think," she said, "but if you're careful, it won't happen.
On the back of Wang, Chen opened the door of the garbage disposal center of the West school district, the house is clean, completely different from the side of the East school district.
"Don't disturb anything here, nor near the doors of the garbage collection."
Chen did not know if there were any managers at the waste disposal center in the West. He gave the students some rope in advance: "There is a small window on the second floor, wait for me to climb from the window to the wall, you see what I do, just follow me.
What about the king?
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wang is short and thin, not too heavy, and this is good news for Chen.
"Be careful, when you get to the second floor, immediately do as I say, and do it quickly! " After distributing the rope, Chen Gao himself bound the king one city, and another rope tied to himself and the king one city, and then back to him to the second floor.
After being sure there was nobody on the second floor, Chen didn't look at it, and ran straight to the window.
Opening the little window, Chen, very skillfully, stepped on the window stand and climbed onto the wall.
A rope was tied to the king's city.
"Is Mr. White teaching sports?"The first response came from the torch, raising the King and sending it out the window.
This is the second floor! Be careful.
Zhong and Zhou also began to help, the three together handed out the king a city.
After a lot of effort, Chen finally got the king on the wall, he is one of the keys tonight, Chen Chen will never lose him.
Once again sitting on the wall, Chen's mood is completely different from before.
He took off his rope, and laid down on the wall and moved to give the other students a place.
Hurry up!
Chen, with the help of the King, found several brick gaps on the wall and tied the rope to it.
The next time you want to go from East to West, you don't have to go through the garbage disposal center, use the rope he left.
It took tens of minutes before and after to jump into the Eastern School District, for the students of the Western School District, the Eastern School District is a completely strange scene.
Chapter 811 Memories of the Torch
The next day, the teacher was chased, turned the wall, it is completely different from the college life I imagined!
There may be more than you can imagine.
Chen grabbed some of the rope that was tied to the wall, and hid it behind the climbing tiger, even if someone passed by, did not find it.
This rope is my back.
Chen was a man when he left the Eastern School District, and when he came back, he became the head of a society.
Teacher, have you found anything that is not right?
Zhang stood straight, his eyes slowly opened in the scar.
What happened?
"Maybe I'm more sensitive, feeling the air on this side of the wall is more viscous, moist, and smells like blood.
He opened his mouth slowly, licked the scars of his upper lip, and his eyes were filled with confusion and doubt: This is more familiar to me than the West Campus.
"Are you kidding?Are you familiar with the breath of blood?"
"I'm not kidding, it's true.
Zhang looked at Chen, standing at the ground, face with smile.
"You don't feel wrong, here is the soil of the dream, in the world behind the door, only with dead bodies and blood as fertilizers, can open the stunning flowers.
Chen, back to the king, indicated that the torch was behind him: "I will take you to a place first, be careful, do not make too big a sound."
Their best camouflage was the night as they walked through the unmanageable bushes.
There was no danger, Chen took the torch to the place where the ghost of the tree.
Can you see here? Chen pointed to the hole where the ghost's head was hidden, and the trees surrounding it.
"We seem to have come...
Isn't that's where the girl was killed?We've seen it in the West!How can it be that there's a similar scene in the East?
"The killing scene in West is just an empty shell, and the bodies and the souls of the dead are hidden in East West, and what you see is the real killing scene.
As Chen said these words, Zhang torch seemed to be attracted by something, he stood alone by the tree hole, his shoulders shivering slightly.
"The Torch?"
He didn't seem to hear Chen's voice, squatted slowly, kneeling beside the hole, his hands trembling into the hole.
"Hey! What are you doing? I remember the girl's head being found in the hole! What are you doing with your hand stretched in?"
Zhou tried to pull the torch, but was stopped by Chen: "Don't disturb him, there is his memory in the hole, lost things to dig out yourself."
"Extract? You're really crazy! """None of Chen's powers,""I can't get out of here,""I can't stand and watch.
On his knees, the torch lay beside the hole, his eyes fixed on the dark hole, his arms slightly out of the hole.
His body was shaking, sweating on the scars of his face, like sliding tears.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
His fingers grasped the dirt and the roots, and his nails began to bleed, but the torch did not feel pain, and his expression was terrifying, and he went mad to dig the bottom of the hole.
"Zhang Torch, are you looking for this thing?" Chen took out from his backpack a rusty knife, the knife that was the trust of the Tree Cage ghost, the dark shadow swallowed the ghost and found it deep in the Tree Cage (see chapter 787), at the very beginning Chen Chen wanted to take a knife to protect himself, did not think too much.
All four weeks were suddenly quiet, and all eyes were focused on the cutlery.
"I found this knife in the tree, and the soul of the dead has trusted in it."
Chen put the knife in front of the torch: "Take it, can you remember your past?"
Zhang was about to collapse, his arms were shaking more and more, his pupils were jumping more and more.
Have you seen this knife somewhere else?Whose hand was this knife in?Whose neck was this knife cut in? Chen's words stuck like a nail to the torch's brain. He shivered his hand toward the knife, and when he touched the handle with his finger, his face suddenly changed, his pupils shrinked, his mouth grew, as if he had touched a burned iron.
Before the torch shouted, Chen had covered the torch's mouth a step ahead: "It's okay, those things are gone, just your past."
Chen's eyes closely on the torch's hand, and when the other hand has a stroke, he will immediately hold it down.
Zhang's strength is much bigger than Chen's imagination, and as the memory is relaxed, his strength is growing, the child should not be ordinary wicked.
Just as Chen was about to get out of control of the torch, the other side finally calm down.
Chen opened his hand, and the torch fell directly on the ground, his lips attached to the earth, the scars on his face appeared sharp.
"I-I've got some things in mind," said Zhang, staring at his shattered nails. "It was the schoolmaster's birthday," said Zhang. "There was a girl who wanted to be with the schoolmaster, but the schoolmaster had her own girlfriend, so he asked me to reject her instead.
I didn't see the girl, I waited, then I heard the silence in the woods, I went quietly, and I saw someone with this knife..."
"The girl is still struggling, but I don't dare go out.
I wasted. I've never seen so much blood before.
Nails dug into the dirt and the scars on the torch's face were squeezed together: "If I stood up then maybe the girl wouldn't have died.
When I went back and called the police, the men had fled, and I didn't know if they had been caught, but I saw one of them very well.
"The next night, we drank a lot, then we sang, and then there was a fire, and I was taken to the hospital, and so on...
"What's going on? Why don't I remember?"
"The burn was taken to the hospital, and your memory stayed here."
Chen has already known that the torch has passed.
Chapter 812 Image of a Doctor
"I could see the fire spreading, burning faster and faster, and the smoke was rolling, and there were screams and cries everywhere, and I didn't open my eyes, and I wanted to run out, but as soon as I opened the door, the flame went straight into the closet.
The torch lay on the ground, and a blue line came out of his forehead, and the scar on his face trembled softly: I didn't know where the pain came from first, and I fought hard to get out, and I could barely breathe, and my eyes could barely see, and I finally fainted in the hallway.
"I felt as though someone had lifted me, and I remained conscious at that time.
I should have been sent to the hospital, I could have heard the parents and the doctor, I wanted to open my eyes, but when I opened my eyes, I saw a completely dark world, as if everything had been baked.
Zhang's voice began to return to normal, and he was paralyzed: "I can remember my parents' faces, I can remember my doctors and nurses, but I can't remember how I woke up from my coma, or how I came to this school.
"There is no such possibility," said Chen, "but you have never been awakened, and this is the world where you are lost."
Didn't I wake up? Here's the world after I lost my mind?
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
Zhu feels like he is the only normal person in the society, the weapon is still carrying himself more safe.
"What Zhang said was not entirely unreasonable, but he did say something wrong.
The world is not his one dream, but gathers many people's negative emotions and despair experiences, and finally forms a nightmare.
Chen looked over the faces of all members of the society: "You are all trapped in this world, and this world is made by you.
After Chen had finished, the forest was very quiet, everyone looked at him, the face was very wonderful.
"I know you may not be able to accept for the time being, but it doesn't matter, we have time."
Chen, behind Wang, looked at the wall far away: "Wang Wang memories wake up and bring the administrator, now the torch your memories also begin to relax, the administrator is very likely to come, we must leave as soon as soon as he said.
Chen turned around and walked out to the wood.
"Wait!"
Zhang with his hands grasped the red earth, slowly lifted his head, eyes tightly fixed on Chen: "Who are you? Why tell us these?
It doesn't matter who I am, but it matters that I can help you get out of here. In reality, your relatives have been waiting for too long.
Chen smiled, "In fact, I'm very like you, and I've lost some of my childhood memories, so when I meet you, I seem to have seen myself once.
With a call, Chan walked away: "I am your lucky, I was not guided at first, a man searching in the darkness, lost too much..."
Chen was so moved that he led the members of the association away from the experimental building and the staff apartment building, and along the small road to the next to the teaching building.
"The toilet on the top of the teaching building," I said. "The answer I want should be here."
The classroom in the west is quiet, but the classroom in the east is strange, and as soon as you get close, a cold will creep on your back, hitting your brain.
"Be quiet. If something happens here, the consequences will be very serious.
Chen singing.
What's going to happen? Zhou's forehead sweated, and he grabbed the knife he had taken from the tree hole, ripped his back, looked around, and looked very nervous.
"How do we deal with garbage in our everyday lives," Chen said with a smile, but the words made several members of the society breathe. "When we are caught, we will be separated from the goods, and we will be thrown away directly after we have exhausted all the values.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
I don't know if it's a mistake, the night in the East is more dark than in the West.
Step on the broken stairs, the stair hand left burned marks, beside the empty classroom could hear silently the sound of the chair moving.
"It's a scary place. I can't imagine it being separated from us.
Zhuang lowered his voice and walked to the end of the line.
"No," he said.
Zhou, holding the knife tightly behind the torch, fearing that face full of scars students suddenly fall sick to hurt themselves.
The more you worry about something, the more accidents will happen, and Zhou has been staring at the torch, and the other side walks and suddenly stops.
What's the matter?
All right, I'm curious, why are so many pictures of doctors on the corridor of the teaching building?The torch looked up at the doctor on the wall.
Yes, have you noticed that's all a doctor's work photo.
Zhang's words attracted Chen's attention. He had previously felt the pictures of the doctors strange, but he couldn't find the reason, and at this time, said Zhang, he suddenly thought of a possibility.
"The world behind the door is made up of the memory of the doorman, the school is very special, containing the memory of all the students, and the doctor's photos on the wall may be the people the students have actually met.
Chen touched the torch's shoulder gently: "Look at these pictures and see if there are any doctors you know.
Doctors who can be put on the wall are the top of the industry, how can I know?
"Here, doctors may have some special meaning. Just do as I say.
Chen, as he led the members of the group to the floor, as he passed through the third floor, stopped abruptly: "Do not move, there is someone in front.
The classroom on the third floor near the corridor had no locks, and the poor quality wooden door was blown with the wind.
Chen They stood still in the hallway, and after a long time, there was a dark way out of the classroom.
"This body is a little familiar, is it often isolated?
Chapter 813 Do you dare?
Black and often solitary, but agile, not like an almost blind person.
Chen didn't dare to go out, and he wanted to continue to watch for a while, but the other man ran directly to the other side of the corridor, seeming to be looking for something.
Is It Always Alone? Is His Eye Restoring?
The classroom is dark, even Chen has dark eyes, still walks careful.
Teacher, is that your acquaintance?
"Do more than do less. Let's go to the top."
Chen looked at the dark, the other did not leave, but entered another classroom.
There were others in the middle of the night, the variable increased, and Chen didn't know whether it was good or bad.
Several people come to the fourth floor, the toilet on the other side of the corridor, need to pass through the long corridor.
Don't answer, Don't get out of the line, don't you understand? Chen instructed the members, and went into the corridor behind the King.
He lowered his body and looked at the two sides of the classroom with the extra light of his eyes.
The windows were painted black, and nothing was seen.
The members followed by Chen, they tried to control themselves not to look at both sides, but the more heart told themselves not to look at random, the more uncontrolled eyes looked at the other.
What is that?
The classroom seems to haven't been cleaned for a long time. As Zhou passes through a window, he sees a line of hair-like things beneath the window, and it feels like a girl is lying on the window of the classroom.
Wouldn't it be a personality? He stood up, his head slightly tilted, and looked down at the window of the classroom.
"The hair... is moving?"
Until Zhou had a clear view, his body suddenly hit something, suddenly prevented, he didn't hold the steady hand knife, the rust knife fell on the ground.
The rusted knife and brick collided with a slight sound, which was heard in the late-night lecture hall.
Everyone stopped and Chen looked at Zhou.What are you doing?
"I accidentally hit the torch," said Zhou, covering his nose, and pointing at the torch which was still there, he found the torch's expression a little strange: "You are going well, how did you suddenly stop?"
"The Torch?"
No matter how the others cried, the torch did not respond, he stared at the pictures on the wall, with a calm look of sadness.
When he saw the knife that killed the girl in the trees, he collapsed, and now he is completely different from before.
There was no mad scream, no self-indulgence to relieve the mental pain, he just stood quietly in front of the photograph.
"This doctor...I've seen him.
His voice was so small that only those around him could hear.
"That fire burned one fifth of my skin, and I watched the flesh burn, and I smelled the smell of my own body, until my eyes melted, and my skin was stuck together, and my world became dark.
"I was sent to the hospital because it hurts so much that I don't feel the pain.
The eyes were not opened, the nose was burned, one ear was two-thirds, and one ear was one-third.
"I've become a monster, I can't see myself, but I know I'm not anymore, and I can't go back and live as an individual.
Have you ever tried to hear your family's voices with two-thirds of your ears?
Someone is saving me,,I am getting closer and closer to being alive, but how am I going to wake up?
"I can't feel the light," "I have only a shadow in the world that my right eye sees," "do you say," "do I still have to live?" The torchman pressed on the photograph of the wall, and his face was bleeding, and a tiny thread of blood emerged from beneath his skin, as if it were a needle for surgery.
"This doctor I know, who accompanied me for a week, who was to take away my life, and who was to bet with him. " His voice grew dull, and the torch's throat seemed to have been burned by fire, and his appearance gradually changed.
Scars and scars spread over his face, his ears began to dry like flowers, and his left eye gradually melted.
"I didn't say a word to him, but I was impressed by him, and at the last moment of my life, he was one of my three.
Their guilt unlocked the torch's memories, the doctor who had rescued them made clear their blurred memories, the fragments of their minds fused together, and a thread of blood poured out of his skin, as if the healed scar were breaking again.
His coat was getting a little red.If you were like me, would you choose to live or die?
"Are you wearing a half-dress?Are you going to get back to what you were like?Are you going to get back to what you were like?Are you going to get back to what you were like?Are you going to get back to what you were like?"
Zhou could not even pick up a knife, grabbed Zhulong's arm, the two unconsciously retreated to three meters.
No one answered, and Zhang's eyes slowly moved away from the photograph, and he looked at Chen-I thought I was who, now can you tell me who you are?
The two stood on the dark corridor, looking at each other.
You asked me, and I gave you the answer.
Chen, standing on the ground, did not step back: "We are the same, I want to find my forgotten memories, to help you are to help myself.
You're lying! Zhang reached out to Chen, but when his finger was about to touch Chen, he stopped again.
Why stop? Chen took a step forward, and approached the torch's face of despair. Are you afraid that after I have been killed, another will I stand up from the body? Are you afraid of me in red?
His hands grasped the torch's shoulder, Chen's face was insane, his hands moved on the torch's shoulder, finally slowly raised the torch's face, touched the other's forehead gently.
Kill me?
Not only Zhang, but also Zhou and Zhulong, who were hiding behind.
There was noise in the corridor, and after a long time, Chen opened the torch, and he looked at the other members of the group:
"I just want to find the memory I lost, and you help me, and you help yourself, and it's the same.
Chapter 814 Moveable Doors
Zhang has long discovered Chen is not ordinary, the eyes can keep quiet no matter what see, as if nothing in the world can surprise him.
Frankly, he was very afraid of people like this, but it was because he was afraid that he chose to listen and follow.
Standing in front of the photo, the torch opened the only left eye, he silently looked at Chen's face.
The ordinary five of the mixed with the face of not found, but it is such a person, just inadvertently exposed even the face of fear.
It's hard to describe it as if a grievous ghost and a deformed madman were combined, and from that face you could see madness, sickness, cruelty, but you couldn't see fear and fear alone.
Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, we should be one."
He believed Chen's words, because that expression only someone who has lived through hell possessed, and the other, like himself, forgot the past.
"I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I remembered some very unpleasant memories, so I lost control.
Zhang's voice was hard to hear, but his attitude was much better.
All right, how can a teacher really blame a student? Chen, with a smile on his face, feels very good, very gentle, and it is hard to believe that he is the one who just spoke to Zhang Tor.
It's nothing, it's just some painful memories.
The wounds of the torch were still pouring out, and his clothes were a little red: I remembered myself as a witness to the murder, as a coward; I remembered the feeling of burning skin, like a needle in the flesh, until I felt no pain; I remembered myself lying in a sterile hospital, struggling, desperate to grow, I didn't want to die, but I didn't know how to live.
There was something special happening to you or around you at the last stage of your life. The torch appeared in the world inside the door, but at that time he had lost the ability to open the door. Chen was curious about how he had entered the school, and only knew how to enter it could have been a chance of finding his way out.
Within the Samsung scene, the "gate" is the only entrance, but the four-star scene seems to be somewhat different.
"The End of Life"
The Torch reached out and touched her face: "I seem to be in a coma, but I can feel the outside, and I do not know the reality and the nightmares, but I do remember one thing, that at the end of the night, a door appears in the hospital.
"The door?"
"I've been in the hospital for seven days, and that door comes up every night, and it gets closer and closer to me, until it finally runs to my bed."
I could not seek help. On the eighth night, the door was pushed out of it, and one hand stretched out the door seat, and dragged me into it.
The Torch describes the case of the often solitary, they all meet a "gate" that moves itself, and every morning at midnight, the door slowly approaches the sleeping person, and finally stands by the bed, pushing the door from the inside, taking the living person to the bed.
Chen was more curious about what happened behind the door, and he wanted to know about the process of losing the memory of the student who was destroyed in the fire, and how he gradually became a half-dresser.
The Torch shook his head.I had a dream, a dream that was so real, that in the dream they all called me Lin, and I told them repeatedly that I called the Torch, and they recognized the wrong person, but they thought I was joking.
"No one believes me. I can only live in my dreams by the name of Lin Lin, and experience all that Lin Lin has encountered, for a long time, and even myself began to doubt whether I really was called Lin Lin
Being bullied,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I have no friends, the world hates me, mental and physical torment slowly makes me sick, until one day, a girl enters my dream.
It was a rainy day, and a frog was stuck in the bookshelf of the same table, and she doubted that I had done it, but how could I do such a boring thing?
No one listened to my defence, my classmates drove me out of the classroom, everyone in the corridor looked at me with a different look, and I had to escape alone to the stage of the classroom.
There, I met her.
Even if I knew it was a dream, I still felt that girl was special.
Zhang's voice changed: "She's the only one who doesn't ignore me."
"I've spoken to her grief," she said.
Then I told her about my past and told her I wasn't really Lin.
"She's interested in what I'm talking about, and I love being with her, because only when I'm with her can I not forget myself, not be assimilated by that dream.
"We meet every evening on the stage, and I slowly feel like I can't go without her.
Just as I was feeling more and more colorful, she suddenly asked me a question-do you want to see the scenery outside the school?
"I didn't understand the meaning of the question at the time, but thought about being with her, so I nodded.
That night, after midnight, she took me to the library.
The door of the school library was locked. We turned the window into it and found a mirror behind a bookshelf on the third floor.
"The mirror is big and the girl says it can be used several times, so let me not tell anyone.
"I believe in her," she said, "and I remembered that was the first time I saw a mirror in my dream!"
I asked the girl what I should do
The girl just said let me look quietly in the mirror.
"I stood in front of the mirror, and she hid behind me, and on a dead night, I looked at myself in the mirror.
"The more I see the people in the mirror don't look like me, the more I start bleeding in the mirror, and a scar appears on the face of the people in the mirror.
His ears dried, his left eyes closed, and his face was blurred with blood!
I couldn't keep looking down, but when I wanted to leave, the monster in the mirror caught me!
"The blood flows through the mirror until it is red!"
"I cried out to save, turned my head to see Zheng Wen, but she was silent, and I still remember the last word she said to me-"Why are you afraid?
Her delicate fingers gently touched my left eye and slowly took out my left eye!
"The world lost its colour," "I was dragged away by the monsters in the mirror," "all the wonderful expectations," "in that moment all became the most wicked curse."
Chapter 815 It's just a guess
She took off my left eye, and I was like the monster in the mirror.
"She shattered all my illusions," "I was not Lin," "I was the torch," "I was the monster in the mirror."
The wound washed with blood, and the torch's outer garments were mostly red, and more terrifying was the twisting of the blood on his clothes.
At first, Chen thought the torch was a half-dress, but soon he found himself looking at the other, as the memory was constantly awakened, the blood on the torch more and more, almost to dye the whole body.
"I was dragged into the mirror, and I looked at her standing outside the mirror, and she held my left eye, her lips open, and she seemed to be saying-one more.
My left eye slowly changed in her hands, my memory of this life flashed in the eyes, when she took away my left eye, also took away all my goodness and hope.
dri dri.
The blood dropped on the corridor, and there was a foot in the teaching hall, but no one came, no matter what direction looked.
"What is the world behind the mirror?" Chen asked softly.
Red, there is only red, everything is red.
Zhang's description reminded Chen of the scene after the Samsung test mission: "So how did you come back from?
"There was another me in the mirror, who was full of blood, who wanted to eat me, and I could not think more than to flee.
After a long run, I found behind the mirror the same school, empty, at least on the surface looks like this.
Then what?
"I didn't last the first night, and I was finally caught by the other one behind the mirror.
There was more confusion in Zhang's eyes: "He killed me in memory, but when I opened my eyes again, I returned to this school, and lost most of my memory, and became a member of this school."
That means your memories were altered after you died?
"Well, I don't know what happened in the middle," he said. "You want to know the answer, and you're going to look for the bloody red world in the mirror."
Zhang shouldn't have lied. He looks terrible, but his expression is very serious.
"I probably understand.
Chen said softly: normally the 'gate' is the only way into the bloody world, but in this scene there is a ghost beyond our imagination, he may be on top of the red coat, this guy using the mirror, separately in the other scene in the bloody, can you understand
All the members who were there shook their heads.
"In a simple example, push this door, we enter the world of red blood.
In this red world we found another mirror, and when we touch the mirror, we enter the world inside the mirror.
"If you compare it with dreaming, it should be well understood.
Normal people live in reality, after sleep dream, our thoughts appear in the dream world, but what happens if we dream in the dream world? Our consciousness appears in the dream.
"The red world is composed of despair and negative emotions, and the world behind the mirror is more like a "dream" created by the doorman himself.
Chen didn't spend much effort on explaining to the students, but he did think through a very important question.
When he woke up, he lost contact with all the employees, and the black cell phone was not around, which made his situation very dangerous.
He hasn't been able to understand how the master of the school did?
Not to say black cell phone, but in his shadow, but at this moment, his shadow becomes very normal, Zhang Ya is not inside.
It can be seen from this that I didn't really enter the school.
Just like the torch said, when he looks in the mirror, there is another him.
A gentle, A cruel, These two together are true him.
"I should have the same problem as the torch, some personality inside the mirror, some personality outside the mirror.
All this is Chen's guess, and cannot be guaranteed to be absolutely correct, he is like walking in the fog, at this time the only light in the world is himself.
"The mirrors we used were in the library. "The next thing is to go to the library after finishing the toilet.
Chen expressed his thoughts.
There is nowhere people can't escape, why do you want to go back? Chen couldn't understand, his memories were just awakening, all kinds of memories were floating in his mind, his eyes were a little lost.
"I like the red world more than here, because it's more real than here.
From Chen's words can be heard that he is not ordinary, Zhang Tor thought thought no objection: Exactly, I also want to know what happened to me in the end, is it not reasonable that I should die?
After receiving Zhang's positive response, Chen's expression was more relaxed, and he had a good helper.
Go and see the toilet first.
Chen They've been in the corridor for a long time, but fortunately nothing unusual happened in the classroom.
The blood dropped on the torch, accompanied by the sound of the dripping dripping, and all around could hear the gradual approach, but strangely, they only heard the footsteps, and did not see the people.
"Ju Long, have you seen the change on the torch? His face... too scary.
Zhou did not dare to approach Zhang torch and Chen, feeling that both of them are mad.
"Now, we can only believe that the change in the torch does not mean that he did not deceive us. We are looking for the lost memory.
Zhong's face wasn't too good, he bite his teeth, holding the fingers of the cell phone already white.
"All right," said Zhou, turning his head to look behind him. He was terrified and could not go back alone. "I'm really crazy to have joined such a group.
He wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No!
To be exact, those who turned were staring at the torch and the king on the back of Chen!
Zhu nearly fell to the ground, fortunately Zhulong helped him.
What's the matter?
There's someone behind! There's a lot of people behind us!
Where is it? Looking back, there were only a few of them in the vacant hallway.Are you deluded?
CHAPTER 816 A Boy Without A Face
Zhuang dragged Zhu, the two looked behind, around a dark, could hear the footsteps, but did not see the living.
Who is there?
"I saw them all standing behind us, as if they were living in a world that revolves around us.
"They've been staring at the torch and the city of Wang. We shouldn't say anything to the white teacher.
"It's good," said Zhu. "It's not like you're lying," Zhu said.
The sooner Chen and Zhang Torch had reached the middle of the corridor, the closer to the toilet, the more nervous they were.
"Mr. White, just when Zhou saw someone following us, they all stood up, and I don't know what to say.
Zhong dragged Zhou to Chen.
"When I lowered my head to pick up the cutlery, I saw that behind us were all men, their heads down, floating in the air.
No,they're like walking on a ceiling,they're supposed to be attracted to the torch and to the kingdom,I've seen with my own eyes,they've been staring at the torch and the kingdom.
Zhu didn't want to get close to the torch, which is a kind of instinctive disgust.
Standing People Chen has seen those people in the laboratory: Go to the bathroom first and see if there are 'doors'. If there are no crops in the toilet, we will leave immediately.
This school is too tricky to give Chen a sense of security even with a red coat.
When Chen was only a few steps away from the toilet, his neck was suddenly held by a hand.
Two cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King
Don't go in.
Wang's voice was very different from his usual, with a strong sense of repentance, it felt like a worn-out tramp dog, trying to protect his companion's body, and then being beaten by others.
Who are they?
Classmates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Wang tried to squeeze a smile, but could not.
"Have you fooled this child?What are you talking about?" Zhulong, carrying a pink cell phone, quietly approached Chen, the atmosphere in the classroom was too depressing, to be able to feel a little comfort only with Chen.
King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King King
"They let me get you in, I didn't promise, they beat me, they let me climb the stairs, I heard them, but they weren't ready to let you go.
Remember, no matter who takes you to the top of the classroom, you're not going! Don't go!
"Are they looking for someone else to deceive Lin?"
"I don't know, but I've told the teacher, why doesn't he come?" Wang was a little anxious, and the only life-saving straw in his heart was the teacher, but the teacher didn't seem to have come, and perhaps the teacher hated Lin thought too.
"It's all right. I'll just go and see it.
Don't Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go
It is not possible to give up Chen, and now with the torch help, this is still strong half-dress is one of Chen's wars.
Wang's arms grew more and more powerful, and his arms were stretched out, and the child was desperate to stop Chen from entering, and should not have seen the tragedy reappear before his eyes.
The toilet on the top of the classroom is at the bottom of the corridor, the air here is spreading a nasal disinfection smell, the wall brick can see yellow brown stains, the ground leaves stains, and each shoe print.
Those shoe prints come from different people, many.
The door of the toilet is locked, Chen take out the tool force it to open.
As Chen pushed the door of the toilet, he took a step back, he looked carefully inside the toilet.
The toilet in the east seems to be completely different from the one in the west, very dirty and messed up, as if the place had been forgotten by the school, had never been cleaned, and had never been entered by anyone.
Has therm been locked since Lin thought of it? Chen returned to ask Wang, the child was not able to speak at this time, his body trembling as if he had been sick.
Compared to the West School District, this toilet makes Chen's feeling more real, he entered it with a king's back.
As soon as he stepped into the toilet, Wang shut his eyes, he did not dare to see, even to remember.
This room doesn't feel like any other.
The Torch looked around, and the walls were filled with things like blood, like cracks all over the toilet.
Those faces painted on the walls were blurred, as if to be forgotten memories.
Those dry threads climbed all over the walls, wrapped them up, seemingly unwilling to see them again.
Going to the first door, Chen took out Lin's cell phone stretched into the gap, the screen had several shadows moving.
Who's inside?
Chen opened the shutter door, the scene before him exceeded his expectation.
There was a model in the first compartment, and he was wearing a pair of black leather shoes, probably between the ages of thirty and forty, and he looked like the white teacher Chen had seen before.
"Why is there such a difference between a pair of shoes placed in the toilet in the West and a pair of shoes placed in the first space in the East?"
The little white teacher in the room, with her hands behind her head, standing upright, as if he had made a mistake.
Chen didn't see any problems using his dark eyes, and finally he took out Lin's cell phone to shoot the first interval.
He was surprised by the display on the screen.
There was a picture of a faceless boy holding his hands behind his head and doing the same thing as a white teacher.
"Isn't this faceless boy Linus? Did Mr. White punish him in this way, so he punished him in the same way?"
CHAPTER 817 Will You Be My Friend
Chen pushed out the second compartment, which contained a thin male doll, who had a deformed foot, curled in the compartment, and threw mud and garbage around.
"It's like a king."
The second space doll and the King on the back of the song wear blue sports shoes, this doll should be the designation of the King.
Chen picked up his cell phone to shoot at the second interval, the screen is touching.
The faceless boy was forced into the toilet, where people threw all kinds of garbage on him.
The boy on the screen does not resist, let alone deceive.
The Puppet in the third room, wearing glasses, washed with red paint, stood by the wall of the toilet.
The character is somewhat similar to the tall thin boy Chen saw in 413 dormitory.
With previous experience, Chen directly uses the cell phone to close the gap.
There appeared on the screen a boy without five, he stands alone in the toilet, and people around him constantly spray paint in the toilet.
His clean clothes were dirty and painted down the corner of his clothes.
The boy lowered his head and said nothing.
"These bullies are out of control." Chen pushed the door of the fourth compartment, where the puppets were not dressed, and the clothes were wet and thrown to the side of the crater.
Chen took out his cell phone to shoot in the fourth interval, the faceless boy in the picture slowly take off the coat full of paint, someone dropped a bottle of water on him.
The Fifth, The Sixth...
Each of the screens is astonishing, when people go into madness, they do not know how bad their behavior is, they unreservedly spread all the negative emotions to one person.
When he opened the first compartment, Chen just wanted to find the truth, everything here had nothing to do with, he was just a passerby, a victim who wanted to get out.
But after six consecutive intervals, there was a change in his heart, and his face was dark, and it would have been surprising if anyone who knew him had seen it, because this man rarely showed such an expression.
Changing expression is the change of inner emotion, revealed on the face, the inner thoughts will be exposed, the weaknesses will be found, so Chen, when carrying out the task of the black cell phone, always remain calm.
"Is this child?
Lifting his head, Chen looked at the seventh chamber, which was the only chamber without a puppet, and also the only chamber without a door.
The ax of the door was violently destroyed, the connection was rarely seen breaking wood, the door of the seventh interval was knocked out.
The doors flying, The inside of the chamber is filled with stuff like the seeds, precisely the seeds in the toilet are actually climbed out of the chamber, the seventh chamber is the source of all the seeds.
"Is Lins originally locked up in this room?
The black threads like dead climbing tiger, they climbed the walls of the separation, seeming to hide something.
Chen took out Lin's cell phone, he adjusted the brightness of the screen to the brightest, and then shot at the interval.
The faceless boy with his coat and trousers, the sewage and the paint flowing down his body, six colours, like a monster with claws dancing on his body.
The bathroom door on the screen seemed to have been covered with something from outside, the boy lowered his head, held his clothes, and hit the board for a moment.
He didn't have a face, couldn't see his face, couldn't hear his voice, didn't know if he was crying or calling for help.
Chen only saw the child constantly knocking on the door until he knocked on the door.
He stood with his feet at the door of the ward, covered himself with his painted and dirty trousers, his hands hanging down, his arm which had just hit the door had been broken by pieces of wood, the blood was running on his arm, and the paint was pouring into his wound.
He wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The boy stood at the door for a long time. He slowly raised his hand and put on one of the wet clothes.
He had no injuries except for his arm, but his body was shaking with pain.
The pants were cut in between, and there was a big hole behind the clothes, and the boy was wearing all the clothes, and the ground was filled with the stain of an unbearable monster.
He wiped his face and tried to walk to the door of the toilet.
The corridor lighted into the toilet, the exit was bright enough to illuminate the boy's appearance at the moment, bright enough to leave him nowhere to escape.
The steps back, he dressed in dirty clothes, again in the seventh compartment.
leaning against the wall of the toilet, the boy's body slowly sliding, he curled in the corner, the face of the not-five-man at the door of the toilet, he seemed to wait for the light to go out.
The screen did not end there, the child looked for a long time, then raised his head.
There were no five faces to Chen, he seemed to know that someone was looking at him.
Would you like to be a friend with me
Chen's ears sounded like this, and he heard it very clearly, but when he looked at the direction of the sound, there was nothing.
"From your cell phone? "It's impossible."
The shot was in the last scene, the face of the faceless boy crouched in the corner of the room, the face of Chen, as if waiting for Chen's answer.
"I'd like to be friends with you, even though you sound like a curse.
Chen didn't care about the curse, his life was changed from a cursed love letter, without that love letter, when he did the first task, he was cut into pieces.
Chen agreed, but the boy on the screen still kept the move.
Move the cell phone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Can You hear me? Chen tried to communicate with the other person, without any effect, he waited a long time, the screen of the mobile phone changed again.
The door of the seventh compartment was pushed out and a red hand stretched in.
The hand grasped the faced boy, as if he had said something to the boy, the faceless boy nodded gently.
Afterwards the faceless boy was taken by the hand, went to the other side of the "gate" disappeared.
What did he say to the boy? Chen thought suddenly of the word he had just heard: What did the master of the hand say to the faceless boy--would you like to be my friend?
The faceless boy promised, and then he disappeared?
Chen carefully combed.
The faceless boy is Lins, he does not push the door, but the blood hand is stretched out from inside the door, which means that there was a door in the toilet.
The Master sent an invitation to Linth, finally Linth agreed to the other, so thought, that the only bloodman is the doorman.
Chapter 818 I am not necessarily enemy to him
It was a great step forward for Chen to find the true master of the school, even though he only saw one hand of the other.
"I just heard someone ask me-"Will you be my friend?"
"This is not from my cell phone. I hear it very clearly from my ear.
He probably didn't say this to Lin, but to me.
Chen looked back, and the red blood in the toilet, when did the big pieces begin to fall, like the fall leaves, completely lost life.
Did you promise him?
The King, who kept his eyes closed on his back, suddenly opened and put his head on Chen's shoulder, and his voice was very low, and he could not hear at all.
"Well, he looks very poor.
Chen's neck washed away by Wang, and the two bodies were tied together, and he felt that Wang's body temperature was falling.
'All his friends are dead!' ''''The'''The''''The''''The''''The'''''The'''''The'''''The'''''The'''''The'''''The''''The'''The'''The''The''The''The''The''The''The'The''The'The''The'The'The''The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'The'
That bright red look a bit sharp.
"You...
Chen had Wang cast off from his back, and the child's hands waved helplessly, grasping the air with force, and tears poured out from the close eyes: Did you remember anything?
Returning to his hometown, the memories of Wang were touched, and he had never opened his eyes, but had heard Chen's words, and realized what had happened.
You have promised that man will come and find you wherever you go! King's voice changed greatly, and he fell into a frenzy, completely different from the timidity that he showed at first.
"He doesn't come to me, I'll go to him. I like to make friends, in all sorts of ways.
Chen has many friends, but they are not around, so he also wants to know some new friends.
The blood flowing from Wang's eyes slipped from his cheeks, his coat was dyed red, the bright blood on his skin seemed to blossom like a flower, and this looked very weak boy, had the potential to become a red coat.
"I'm becoming more and more interested in the master of the school and how he got all of you into the door.
Chen didn't expect to find a few members of the society, each not simple, which is of course a component of luck, but also in another way explains school's terrible.
A Half Red Dress is enough to a normal two-star scene, and in the school of ghosts is the existence of a red coat and a suspected red coat, Chen has seen several.
Are your constant jokes hiding your inner panic?
Hearing Wang's words, Chen was even more sure that the other party had recovered memories, the former Wang Wang was timid, never to raise objections, only a taste of obedience.
"I'm not kidding, I'm sure I've had hope, even if it's been crushed.
I wanted to help him, to be his friend is only the first step.
"Have you noticed that most of the children in this school have a deformed childhood, or have a deformed body, or have a deformed personality because of some external factors, and they all have a hard time remembering themselves," Chen said.
What do you want to say
"I'm curious what the owner of the school has experienced before, as a doorman, what experience has made him open this 'door'?
Promise to be his friend will always be left, the school was not so big, and the constant despair and pain of joining it made it what it is now.
After Wang said this, the eyes stopped leaking blood, but the body still shaking.
"It looks like you know a lot.
Chen felt like the school and its own ghost house, only the ghost school is constantly looking for the desperate students, or to attract the desperate children, and Chen's ghost house is the visitors refused.
"What I can think of is, here, when I open my eyes.
I didn't have the torch, I died in this school, I live again here, I've forgotten a lot, I just know that this school is expanding.
"Why are you here? Isn't Lin's punishment for you?"
Wang stopped for a long time before he began: "I am the only one left by Linth, and I am here because after Linth's disappearance, I became his substitute.
The fear and anxiety of the students turned into violence occurred on me, one night when I was about to collapse, the door found me.
According to the torch, the door first appeared to be very far from where you were sleeping, and then gradually approached you every day...
"The King" wasted by the King.
"He's completely passive, and I'm active, and I want to find a corner that can hide, besides..."
Wang had a long hesitation to tell another secret: The hand that stretched out the door, painted with all kinds of paints, was the hand of Lin, and he invited me, and I wanted to say an apology to him in the face.
I actually reported to the teacher, but he didn't come.
What else do you know about Linus and the door?
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
You can let me down.
You're sure you're not lying? Chen put down Wang: At the toilet door of the West School District, as soon as your memory shifted, the school administrator immediately appeared, and in the end if I didn't make you faint, I'm afraid we'd been caught now, and your treatment is completely different from that of Zhang Tor and Zhu Long.
"Maybe because Lin is his friend, and I am Lin's friend."
Several people walked through seven separates, here recordings of what Lins had encountered, should have been captured only partly.
I can't imagine what the doorman had done before.
As he was about to get out of the toilet, Chen looked at the seventh compartment: "To make sure the door is in the seventh compartment, to know the owner of the school, you just need to investigate everything that happens in the school in the bathroom.
Based on the clues, Chen was then prepared to go to three places - the school archives, the school library, and the oil painting room promised by Zhou.
Chapter 819 They Come
The school's archives may contain information about the school's owner, the library may contain mirrors to the blood-red world, and the laboratory's oil painting room is where Chen has promised to go.
"Where do you want to go first?" Chen looked at the picture. "I know where the art house is, and I have seen the scenes you dreamed of, and now I can take you with me, but are you really ready to wake up your memories?"
Zhou didn't communicate much with Chen, was asked by Chen suddenly, some are confused.
Before returning to his memory, he had been wondering what he had forgotten, but he had been hesitant to see the final of the match between Zhang and Wang.
"Are you ready for the past? "The memory is not awakening, you are just an unimportant student in this school, you can do anything, repeating a peaceful and beautiful day.
Once you wake up, you will be tracked by the school administrator, and there will be no way back.
Chen always asked Zhou, also a test, among all the members of the society, Zhou is the most dominant.
"I think it's better to get back to the memory," he said. "I think it's better to get back to the memory.
Zhou's eyes turned to the torch and to the king: "I don't know how real I am, will I scare myself to cry?"
You'll have to think about it again. The torch was dull, and he twisted the burned face. There was a feeling on you that made me feel very uncomfortable.
Zhou shut up for a moment, not knowing how to answer, his eyes drifted, and his heart seemed to shake again.
"Let's go to the school's archives. "You have enough time to think.
Chen touched Zhou's shoulder gently: "Don't worry, I respect any of your choices."
"Thank you.
Zhou washed his head and touched Chen with the torch next to him: "The way he looks should be terrible. If he can wake up the memories, whatever we want to do next, it will be a little easier.
"Everyone has a choice. I'm not going to interfere.
"Are you helping us to recover from the past, to increase our strength, and then to help you achieve your goals?"
"I've seen such a thing in a book, that roses don't ask why, they don't ask for a return, they bloom just because they bloom.
I'm not so selfless, but at least I've been through the pains you've been through, and I've been reminded of myself by seeing you.
"There's one more thing I want to reiterate: our relationship is not mutual use, it's mutual gain, and mutual respect is the basis," Chen said.
Hearing Chen's voice, at one moment Li seemed to have forgotten, the man in sight was just an ordinary man.
Maybe he just didn't find his memory.
Zhang and Zhuang pointed, followed Chen's footsteps.
Wang's eyes opened with tears, seemed to more recognize Chen.
Walking the last week, if you think, eyes slowly become firm.
Back to the corridor, Chen hasn't gone out a few steps, very soft feels a little less.
There was a thick smell in the air, which he had heard in the laboratory.
A bad feeling came to the heart, the more forward Chen go, the more depressed, it is like walking on the bottom of the lake, cold from all sides.
"They've come back again?"
Chen didn't look down, things have happened, look down only disturbs his judgment, he needs to leave the teaching building as much as possible.
Standing with the torch, Chen's eyes shrinked and lowered their voices: Did you see the monsters in the corridor?
The Torch stared at the corridor, and his blood slipped through his coat.There seemed to be something, but they seemed not to hurt us.
When the torch saw his hair floating upward, it was as if an invisible baby had caught his hair in the darkness.
A trail of tiny wounds began to appear on the torch and the king city, which monsters were attracted to by the two.
"I can't see them, how did they hurt me?" The scars on the torch's face were continuing to bleed, and his blood was flowing, and his memory was awakening, but he hadn't learned how to use this power.
"We can see them just by turning our eyes, but I don't recommend that you do it.
"Why?
"Because you'll be more desperate when you see it."
Chen pointed out that the monsters attacked Zhang Torch and King's City without knowing it was by instinct, or by some, if the latter, it would be more trouble.
The smell was getting thicker and thicker and the wounds were getting heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier.
As soon as several people ran to the corner of the third floor, King could not stand, his steps became more and more helpless: "I felt that many things were tearing apart my body, and my memory became blurred again.
"Mr. White," said Zhou, "there seems to be more dirt downstairs," and as soon as they had reached the third floor, they smelled a nasty smell, stranger still, that came from around them.
Lower your head as if you were picking up a cutlery, and look from the bottom up to where the smell spreads around.
There was a twisted face between him and the king. The monster's coat was tightly attached to the flesh. It seemed to have no skin.
King, King, that thing is in front of you!
"I've told you don't look," "I don't see, I don't worry."
Chen directly back to Wang, one foot on the most smelly place, and then fly down to the floor.
Zhou covered his chest, where Chen just stepped was the monster's head: Okay, I know.
As they descended to the second floor, the smell filled the corridor, the memory of the loose Zhulong also became the target of the monsters attack.
Zhang was able to resist, but Zhulong and Wang could not keep up, only by Chen and Zhou to continue.
Chapter 8
Things were moving in a worse direction, and Zhou began to be caught by the monster, with the first wound on his finger.
What now, Mr. White?
Chen had no better way than to squeeze the teeth, and even if all of them were squeezed by the monster and lost their ability to act, he would bring them all out.
The smell came into his nostrils, and he was almost convulsed, and when Chen was about to approach the corner of the first floor, he had a burst of pain in his chest.
Chen almost fell to the ground.
He looked down, and was stabbed in his chest with a sharp nail.
"The curse of the 413 bedroom?" he realized at once, looking at his shadow.
The original shadow was twisting at this time, as if the "people" hiding inside were enduring great pain.
Even he was attacked?
All the members of the circle reached the limit, the scales, looking very scary.
"The exit is right here, don't stop!"
Chen's will is very strong, he is already accustomed to pain.
Take off your nails, Chen is trying to run forward, even more step, the distance will be closer to hope.

"I draw with the hand..."
It's been very difficult for Chen to bring one out, and more is not possible.
Their legs were filled with lead, and each step was heavier. The smell on the first floor was more intense than on the second, and there were more monsters waiting for them.
Everyone except Chen had despair, but here it was, the smell of the air suddenly faded, as if someone had taken away some monster.
"The chance!" Chen, pulling out of Zhou's picture, and running on the back of Wang's city, when he came to the first floor, he saw a dark shadow standing at the other end of the corridor.
The man was very similar to a solitary, with a shimmer of red in his left eye, with blood leaking under his coat, and with something in his hand.
"Sometimes lonely," Chen shouted directly, but the other did not respond, and he turned away, and the smell of the corridor faded a little.
Chen's impressions of loneliness and weakness were very different from the one he had just seen: What happened to him just a few seconds before I entered the door?
The shadowed most of the monsters, and Chen quickly led the members of the community away from the teaching building.
"Mr. White, what happened to these monsters? Why can't one see them except by turning their eyes? And why don't they attack the King and the Torch, and not you?"
"These monsters should be used by the school to punish the students, even if it is possible that they were the ones who broke the school rules.
Chen didn't realize that the monsters weren't even afraid of the red coat, they completely lost their senses, they were a bunch of crazy.
"The master wants to create a beautiful "land" after the "gate" and you remember the past, which is contrary to his intentions and he will naturally turn to you.
Chen examined Wang's and Zhang's bodies, and the black threads had already drilled into their wounds, near the wounds, and could still smell a faint odor: be careful, the monsters may want to make you their kind.
Standing outside the classroom, Chen, using his dark eyes, did not see the last save his darkness.
"If he's really lonely, why doesn't he come to me? Isn't it time to meet? Or is he really being watched?"
Chen has nothing to do with the solitary, he needs to guess the solitary's mind, then to make the best choice.
"Someone can help me."
"Let's go to the office now, the school's archives should be there.
The offices of the West are located very close to the walls, standing at the top of the office offices can take everything to the bottom of the two campuses.
"The monsters I've seen in this school can be divided into: ordinary ghosts and stubborns, ordinary red cloaks, white cloaks with burns all over them, and the monsters from the East that spread odor down their heads, except for them, who are the most dangerous in this school, and the offices are where we're going, and there's a great chance we'll meet them, and we must be careful."
There is a tiger in Mingchi, and it is not the first time that Chen has done this, but it is a little uncomfortable for other members of the society.
"Mr. White, aren't you a teacher?"
Don't you think I'm not dangerous?
He'd been to the offices in the West, but he didn't realize that there were huge differences in the interior of the offices in the two districts.
The offices of the West were clean, the offices of the East East felt very suppressed, the ground had not been cleaned for a long time, leaves of clay footprints, the walls were scratched, the original white wall skin had become light yellow, and a big, big scar.
"The teachers in the east area usually work here?"
"In this school, the teacher's duty is not to educate you, but to manage you, and they spend most of their time with the students, and the office is just a symbolic place.
Chen tried to push the door of an office, the wooden door is not locked, the push open.
All the facilities in the room are very old, looking like things from many years ago.
"I've been here, and I know where the archives are," said Zhang in a cold voice, "and he's been less and less interested in talking since he got back to his memory.
When did you come? She was a little afraid of the torch now, and when she spoke she lowered her voice to what she didn't feel.
"Before I was deceived by Wen, I used to sneak into the archives to find out what this school was all about.
The Torch was in front of me. This place makes me uncomfortable and may hide something very dangerous.
I don't know if the monster in the office is aware of the torch, or for other reasons, on the way they didn't encounter danger, to the third floor of the office.
"Here's the file room. We'll find what we want and we'll leave right away. Don't stay too long. I always feel like there's someone else in the room.
The Torch opened the main door of the archives, which contained several rusted metal cabinets and four rows of wooden shelves.
Chapter 821
There was a smell spreading through the archives, and Chen covered his mouth and entered the room first.
The wooden bookshelves look back on years, and next to them are rusted archive cabinets placed together, with an unknown sense of contradiction.
"These bookshelves and metal cabinets seem to be things from different schools.
Chen handed out a piece of information from a wooden shelf, but perhaps because of the poor preservation of the environment, he used a little force, the paper bag appeared to be damaged.
"It looks like this information hasn't been taken seriously by the school.
Chen carefully opened up the paper bag, and the contents of it made him doubt: "Thanks to the donor list? How does this paper look familiar?
Chen looked at it again and again, and suddenly he saw a picture in his mind, and he looked surprised at his paper bag filled with worms: "I seem to have seen such a list in the headmaster's office in the school!
He looked closely and remembered what had happened to him that was more surprising than the name of the donor.
"It's exactly the same! I've seen this list in the office of the principal of the Fuyang secondary school! "
Initially, in search of the old principal, many times entered the old principal, the two-star horror scene has been turned over, but it is a pity dug three feet not find the old principal.
"The world behind the door is made up of the memories of the people behind the door. This school is special, it seems to be formed by the memories of all the people inside the door.
Chen gently put on his chin: "In addition to the old principal, everyone else is in my ghost house. Here is the list of the donors. Does it mean the old principal is also in the school?"
Chen opened his eyes and looked at the dusty bookshelf in front of him, and the more he looked, the more he felt familiar.
"It looks like I have something to do with the old principal.
He put the papers back to their originals, with a delicious expression: "There were nine preconditions before the unlocking of the Tormenting School Trial, and was there any special connection between these nine preconditions and the Tormenting School?"
"Mr. White, have you found anything?"
"There are some discoveries, but we are not yet sure."
Chen also pulled out a tidy file, filled with molds: " Campus Environment Survey Book?
It's more like a garbage room where you can find all kinds of documents, including graduation designs, bills of expenses, company statistics, dining hall procurement catalogues, etc.
"Mr. White," said Zhu Long, who had found a few wrinkled papers in the corner of the town, and took one of them to Chen-"You see the big picture in the middle.
"The teaching building caught fire for unknown reasons, several students were trapped in toilets, and firefighters bravely broke into the fire scene and rescued them."
The report in the middle of the newspaper, very awake.
"The people who write this report should not be of any age," he said.
Chen took over the newspaper, which was filled with mushrooms, and left a large stain, many of which were blurred: "It looks like a school newspaper.
After looking through all the papers, Chen discovered a familiar name, the West Private School.
The name has appeared many times, and many of the stories are about private schools in West City.
"Isn't the West Private School where Zhang Ya lives?"
In the abandoned school, Chen had his first date with the Red Dress.
Also in that school, he entered Zhang's heart.
When you think back, he saw a burning stair lift in the classroom.It's a little strange that not only the private school in Westtown, but also some of the abandoned schools that I've visited, including the school in Fuyang, have burned down.
He looked at the newspaper he handed to Zhulong, where the firefighter rescued six people from the upper floor toilet, and the newspaper called the firefighter a hero, and the whole article was praised.But he also saw at the side of the paper a report calling for people to learn about summer fire, in which he implied that one of his classmates had died in the fire.
"The fire started from the toilet, but how do the toilets fire? The fire occurred after the students had their evening homework, and they were already out of school, so why are the children staying in the toilets on the top of the school?"
Combined with several reports, Chen was very sensitive to the problem: "The fire burned on the fourth floor, at the time there were only students in the toilet, the firefighter rescued six, but another student was lost in the fire, which means that there should be seven people in the toilet at the time!"
What was the cause of the fire, it is not clear now, there is no record of it at all, the child who died in the fire seems also to be a taboo.
But when I went there didn't feel any 'extraordinary'? Chen had doubts in his heart: If the door to the toilet was pushed by the child who died in the fire, then he should be the'pusher' of the private school, but the school in the school system could become a Samsung scene entirely because of Zhang Ya!
Now that private school has become part of the ghost house scene, Chen is very sure that Zhang Ya is the school's most terrifying existence.
"There is a door in every Samsung scene, but the only private school in West is Samsung, but there is no door. " Chen, looking at his shadow, remembers the name, he repeats it, and still has no answer.
"The reason why the West Private School can be rated as a Samsung scene is because Zhang Ya, as far as I know, has not opened any door, and when I went to the West Private School, I did not see any door..."
Chen, holding the paper, slowly laid down, in his mind emerged the hit red dress.
Zhang, the door which should have been but has been lost, push the door man...
These three words became a line in Chen's mind, and he suddenly thought of a possibility.
With his eyes wide open, Chen took a breath of coolness: Shouldn't the doorman of the West City Private School be eaten by Zhang?
Only this explanation can explain why Zhang Ya is different from the others, why the strong spectrum.
What will happen to the door after the pusher is eaten?
Chen suggested various possibilities: Zhang Ya did not become a pusher because of his obstinacy, and the missing pusher should be slowly out of control, but in fact it did not happen, and the pusher would only appear on the bed of desperate children.
Wait! Will it be looking for a new pusher?
CHAPTER 82
Chen was shocked by his own thoughts, a homeless door, constantly looking for a desperate child, spent years, finally turned himself into a four star scene?
It sounded too unbelievable, Chen forced himself to calm down.
There were thirteen paintings in the studio of the laboratory, thirteen of which were painted by thirteen people who knew the secrets of the school and who were probably the thirteen candidates they were looking for.
The power of a single person can hardly support a four-star scene unless the other person overtakes the red coat, but if there are more red coats together, the result is not clear, after all he himself has never seen so many red coats together.
Thirteen, that number is not good.
Chen had a look at Zhou, he had been looking for an art company, and had dreamed of a scene in an oil painting room, this man should be one of the thirteen artists.
"The door should have a choice," said Zhang. "The torch clearly does not meet the criteria," said Zhang.
Chen didn't expect much from the studio at first, but after analyzing, he changed his mind.
Zhou is the most special among the members of the society, Chen now to prepare both hands.
Remember to tell yourself everything, or remember to be your enemy.
"It's a big fish. Isn't the way I used to treat him so casually?"
"Mr. White," I said, "I'll go over there."
Zhou went to the deepest of the archives.
Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run
Chen continued to search in the room brought his surprise far did not end.
Chen soon found several reports about the fire in the archives, the fire seems to have special meaning in the school, both symbolic destruction, and for the rebirth.
There was a fire at Fuyang High School, there were traces of burned stairs, the former school was more like a cemetery, and now I find that there was a fire at the private school in West City, is a coincidence, or a deeper reason?
In addition to the fire report, Chen also found at the bottom of the iron cabinet several archives preserved relatively well, two of which are very special.
One of the files contains the name of Linus, and above the teacher and classmates' evaluation of him.
The students do not want to be friends with him, the teacher is lazy to take care of him, the child has no mother, the father is a murderer, he was adopted as a child, but for some reason, he fled from adoptive families many times, it is very painful.
In his eyes, the only person in the world who really helped him was an intern at the Welfare Institute.
The newly graduated college student, not yet settled in his own life, funded Linth to finish primary school and to attend Linth's parents' meeting.
Based on the teacher's comments, and only when the intern is there, Linth's "multi-activity" can turn better.
There were no photographs or any specific information about Lin, but a hand-written signature was preserved: the Kuyu family.
The whole file wasted, full of wormholes, only the guardian's signature to clean it up.
"If I can get out of here alive, I can go and see it."
Chen is like a self-speaking, and is like deliberately telling someone to listen.
Then he looked at another, which had a date earlier than the others, and which had no name, no record, but a single word.
Hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold
Words in the file weren't written by the teacher, they were written by a child injuring his hand.
"Unbridled indulgence only intensifies the perpetrator, and in any case the perpetrator does not sympathize with and reflect on the perpetrator. "
Chen photographed with Lin's cell phone, then put the file back in its original place.
"The earliest record of time should have been left by the real doorman who, after opening the door, is likely to turn into another extreme.
"If the doorman Zhang Ya has eaten is he, then after his death, the door he has pushed is probably still doing something according to his will, and if I want to increase the probability of surviving after the door, it is better to follow his mind.
Campus Violence has never happened to Chen. He was closest to campus violence when he was in elementary school.
The teacher let the children take toys they don't usually play with to school, ready to donate to welfare.
Everyone donated, but Chen alone covered the book bag and did not speak.
Some of the most skinned children in the class began to rob the book bag of little Chen, and in the process of pushing the book bag to break the lock, resulting in a bloody intestine and a backpack cut out all the fingers.
Their fingers were rolling in the classroom like pencils, and the bloody plastic intestine was still moving a few times on the desk, making the students in the class and the teachers who were going this way look silly.
Later, when the deputy head came, he asked the head of the class what was the family background of the child?
Later that evening, Chen's parents were called to school, and then were taken by the police to question for half an hour.
To put it bluntly, Chen was the only one who was deceived at school, and as a result, his parents were questioned by the police.
But there is also a good side, at least since then, no more of the same age dare to deceive Chen.
"There is no way to get away from campus violence.
In this school, some of the victims have become new sources of violence.
The Ghost School is expanding, and the door that is not bleeded red will come close to all the desperate children, make them part of the door, bring their nightmares back to the door, brick their souls, and build a real grave.
After searching through the archives for a long time until a familiar smell came from the tip of the nose, Chen decided to lead the other members of the association out of the office building.
" Teacher, we are lucky," said Zhulong in a small voice.
"It's not luck, it's someone who helped us get those monsters out."
Chen is not sure if he is often alone helping himself, but he knows that there must be some things going on in this school, and those things are likely to be related to the often lonely brothers.
Let's go to the lab.
Chen looked at Zhou Zhou: You should have made a good decision
CHAPTER 82
Memory is an unspeakable thing, like never melting snow, like instant passing light, longing to catch hold, hoping to forget to forget.
Zhou has been troubled by that dream for a long time, he knows that is different from the others, but he does not believe it, and finally into deep self-doubt.
Until that day he met Chen.
The man was the first to make sure that his dreams were real, that all that he had experienced was not imaginary, but was marked by an indelible memory deep in his mind.
Zhou got the answer he wanted, but at the same time he got himself into a dangerous whirlpool, he didn't know if he would continue to follow Chen, would break down, or get rid of.
Would you like to? Chen, standing in front of Zhou, repeated.
"I..."
"If you're really not sure, look at him.
Zhang and the king came suddenly, and they left and right put Zhou in the middle: Zhulong, come.
On his way to the last of Zhulong's state, he looked very strange, seemed to burn flames, and the whole man was on the brink of collapse.
What did you do to him? Chen looked at Zhulong's left hand, and the boy broke out with his hands on the cell phone.
"We found a missing piece of news in the archives. A freight forwarder who used to travel around the university was missing in the school.A few days after the police investigation, a dead puppet was found in the trash of the anatomy room. "The dead puppet was him," Chen said, handing over several damaged newspapers.
Imagination wasted, Zhulong remembered many things when he saw the paper.
Striving to study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His favorite girl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As the family washed out, only the relatives were still living with serious disease, and the body was getting worse.
fate hit, but did not hit the young man, he began to learn to take care of others, to support the home.
When looking for a job,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was diligent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
During one of the hardest summers, he got used to the work, working till late every day, the only fun was to get some receipts sent to Jiangjiang Medical School.
Every time he entered the school he knew that girl was in the school, even if he looked at the other from a distance, he would feel very satisfied and happy all day.
The school says not much, neither little nor small, and when can meet he does not say.
He imagined the scenes of countless encounters, but when the girl really appeared he found that all the preparations and practices were of no use, and he was so nervous that he could not speak, like a secret child found.
After that day, they left a way of communicating, the girl unexpectedly, she likes the feeling of control, and Zhulong mistakenly thought it was love.
His change was a mental disfigurement, the girl likes to torture Zhong, she always remind Zhong-you're nothing.
Their self-esteem wasted a little, and Zhulong became a girl's doll, even more terrifying Zhulong was not aware of it.
He's awkward little guy, and he's not any better than the expert on anatomy and criminal psychology.
He was like a lamb, whose hair was cut, and whose red stripes were placed on a woman's table, to be slaughtered.
Eventually this damage extends from the mental level to the physical level, until death arrives, Zhulong realizes, unfortunately, everything is late.
Blood flowed from one of the wounds, Zhulong held the pink cell phone, eyes stared at the newspaper of the Chen singer.
His memories of the locks were, after repeated stimulation, finally pushed out.
Do you know which piece of meat is pink?
It was like a needle, sewed the skin, Zhulong walked step by step toward Chan: "The meat is most delicate when the wound is about to be healed, she likes pink."
Zhong's body began to sink, his body had many traces of needle sewing, it was difficult to imagine what he had encountered after his death.
"Another half-dress."
Chen's eyes were so calm that when Zhulong was only two steps away, he lifted his hands and embraced Zhulong gently: I want to ask you to understand one thing, no matter when, no matter what reason, no matter what hurt you should be allowed, even under the name of love.
Looking at the boy nearby, Chen had a little pain in his heart, and he clapped on Zhu's shoulder. "I don't know what you're thinking now, but I can assure you that if we can leave this school, I'll let you see that girl again.
The line through Zhuang's flesh stopped abruptly, Zhuang looked straight at Chen, and then slowly lowered his head.
Grabbing the pink cell phone, Zhulong quietly back to Chen's behind.
Even if they weren't red, they were the top half-dresses, counting for the city of Wang, and Chen didn't have to be afraid of ordinary red dresses.
"Let's go to the lab. " Chen didn't ask about Zhou, he had the answer from the other's eyes.
When the child saw the look of Zhulong, the nails dug into the flesh, he should have had a wish, but now he has forgotten even that wish.
After passing through the bushes, Chen led the members of the group to the experimental building, which was his second appearance tonight.
"That red coat should be in the classroom. If you meet him, just give it back to him."
Chen's voice was enough, and he took the students to the outside of the building.
"This building is the nest of the bodies of the monsters. The art house we are going to is on the fourth floor.
Chen took the first step to the window of a room on the first floor: Now, go up with me.
Several students looked at each other, and then saw Chen climb to the second floor very easily.
I say he must be a sports teacher.
Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CHAPTER 834 Return
"The Eagle."
Inside the bamboo house, she was looking at the playful morning and the dragon, and suddenly, she heard a sound of noise outside, and Liu frowned: What is going on outside? Why is there noise? You go out and look.
"Yes."
After half a sounding, she pushed the door of the bamboo house and came in, saying, Queen, there are two outside, to look for you.
Look for me?I'll go out and see who's looking for me.
Afterwards, she stepped up from her chair and walked out to the door.
Outside, beneath the bloody sky, the two trembled from the front, perhaps too many climbs, resulting in a blood trail beneath their bodies, falling into the eyes of the white face, outward bruises.
What are you doing?
He asked with a cold.
Their faces were pale, their bodies trembled, and they said, Queen, I am here to beg forgiveness of your sins, and on that day it was I who believed in the deceit that made the Queen misunderstand the King, and it was all my fault, and I am willing to make excuses, and to ask forgiveness of her sins.
"No, Princess, it is my fault that I did not give you the order of the king, in fact, the day the king left the royal palace to remove the seal of the evil world, he asked me to come back and inform the Princess that I could not do it, and this gave the traitor an opportunity.
On his knees, his face was filled with tears: "All my faults are my faults," said the queen, "I have nothing to say about them." He took the bamboo rod behind him, put his hands in his hands, and handed it to the white face.
The white hand, slowly grasped the feather dragged to the bamboo line before her, her color light, in the eyes of the invisible light.
It was as if he had noticed the sticking away from his hand, and the feather's body was stiff, and he clutched tightly to his jaw, waiting for the bamboo-like blow.
But...
For a long time there was no pain.
He looked up, and saw a flame of bamboo in White's hand, burning instantly for ashes.
"You have climbed this way and suffered many sins?"
"The King...
The Queen Thern looked at her white face, and she did not understand what she meant.
If so, then your sins have been repaid.
She's always a company.She's only targeted by those who want to hurt her.
On that day, she could be deceived, and what about the elders and firefly? Yes, she never complained about them...
Their bodies were as stiff as iron, and they could not believe that White had passed them so easily?
Before they came, they had prepared themselves for all the scales! Now, she did not even draw them, and eliminated their sins.
When the two men were still kneeling on the ground, they did not move, and the white face fell slightly.
The woman's voice fell into the feather's ears, and the feather immediately climbed from the ground, and his trousers were bloody, and he could not stand.
So he was still on the ground, even though his legs and feet were still shaking, and did not continue to kneel.
White looked into their eyes and pointed to the stone seat on the ground.
CHAPTER 835 Return
Thermal Tears were filled with gratitude, he touched the tears that poured down the corner of his eyes.
"Queen," I said, "I'll never forget your great love for the flame."
If the Queen didn't forgive him, the Queen couldn't leave him in the evil world. So, her atmosphere helped him.
This shouldn't have offended you, I've been covered up myself, and what's the point of blaming you?' said he with a bitter laugh,'s the point of blaming you for the enemy's enough, as long as you remain faithful to the Emper.
Their eyes were filled with guilt.The Queen did not want to blame us, that was the Queen's atmosphere, but I would not forgive myself, and afterwards I would devote myself to all loyalty to the King and Queen.
"Here are two medicines for the wound," he said with a slight sigh. "The wound will be healed," he said. "You don't like being disturbed.
After she handed her medicine to the two, she turned and walked into the bamboo house.
Zhuang did not enter the room with her, she saw the two elders put on Dan medicine, lifted his leg and punched him on one foot.
This foot knocked the two elders to the ground, and fortunately he had taken Dan medicine, and yes, he had not been much hurt.
The old man looked pitifully at the peacock, and the look of the peacock was rather pitiful.
Why didn't you come and ask me?
The Rabbit bit, cried angrily.
A shivering, answered Nono: Is the king?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Stupid! stared the Emperor in anger.If the Queen had not forgiven you, I would not have gone against the wishes of the Queen.
As soon as this was said, the two men, like an amnesty, rushed to the bottom of the sacred mountain, and as soon as they smoked, they ran without a trace.
As soon as they were gone, Zhuang-when they entered, she looked at the white face of laughter, with a burning of anger in her red eyes: "Queen, I am just not used to his foolishness, are you... blaming me?"
White smiled with helpless shaking of his head: "You're just angry, and now the anger is coming, what better?"
Zhu raised her head, and her eyes turned to be careful: Queen, will you not go again after you have returned to the fairy world this time?
I heard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The depressed peacock, when heard the white face laughed.
Her eyebrows were beautiful, and her dress made of flames was very beautiful.
Queen, I can't leave St. until you find Gen, and remember to bring them back to me, then I can leave this place.
Like a thousand years ago, join you in the battle of the sand!
It seemed to think of the previous scene, a glance in the eyes of the jackal appeared, as if through the bloody sky, to see the glory and the blood of the year...
CHAPTER 836 Return
She believed that one day she could be with her brothers, and...
Once the Queen, too will come back strong!
Morning, Little Dragon, let's go.
She smiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Where are we going, my daughter?" "Where are we going?" "Where are we going?" "Where are we going?" "Where are we going?" "Where are we going?"
"Go find your father.
"Now the crisis is over, I want to go back to the sanctuary."
"Return to the Holy Land" "Isn't it possible to see Da?" "I miss Da Da and Chu Da."
White spoke with his fingers to the door of the morning, but the tone was of affection: How many times have I been with you, that is your father's sister, you call her sister, then she is not younger than our generation?
His little hand touched his little head, and his little face looked pitiful.
Sister Chu didn't let Morning call Aunt, or he wouldn't have Morning on fire.
After saying this, the white little morning suddenly reacted, with a panic in his eyes, "My daughter, you have just heard wrong, the morning does not want to set on fire...
Morning is just..."
There's nothing to explain! White smiled coldly, "I've always thought you'd been worn out, and I didn't think you'd like to put on fire in your bones!
"My daughter...
"You know what's wrong," cried the poor boy, grievingly pulling his white sleeves. "Can you stop talking to the Master?"
"Well..." "Well..." "Well..." "Well..." "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well," "Well,
At the end of the speech, she took the hands of two flourish dolls, and smiled toward the bamboo house.
It was the seal was lifted, the sky was still red, as if in the sea of blood, the blood covered the whole world...... In the hall, the Emperor's head held in the heart, staring at the person who was reporting below, His hegemony's spirit covered the whole hall, so that the person who was reporting below had already sweated his back, and his body was shaking.
Suddenly, a red coat washed over Emperor's eyes, and his gloomy eyes cooled down, and his robe was light, and he had come to the woman's side, and lifted his hand and dragged her into his arms.
"How did you come? Didn't I give you a good rest in St.
His voice was as soft as ever before, as if the whole world had no hold of her.
"I have one thing to tell you. I want to go back to the sacred place.
"Well, the king will come with you later."
Emperor's wrinkled half, then he relaxed, rose on his red lips, drew a light smile.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
In that instant, the white faced out before the Lord said to her.
Now...
She is too different from the Emperor, she must raise strength as soon as possible, to be able to fight with him side by side.
And now for her only way to increase strength, is to return to the Holy Land!
"Are you afraid of me fighting with Chu?"
Chu also has an unusual position in the heart of the white.
It was the time when she needed the most help, and the most people who appeared beside her, just this, is enough to make him jealous.
CHAPTER 837
As soon as the Emperor's words were finished, the woman in front of him stood up at the tip of his feet, and sent his red lips to his lips, with two arms cling to his neck.
Her kiss was very gentle, as if there was an endless love.
After a half, White opened his arms and gently touched his head:
Well,you're here waiting for me,I'll be back soon.
Her tongue, like comforting a little animal, but this feeling of death made his heart crunch.
So he refused and said with a soft voice, "Well, I'm done with the fairies, and I'll go to you."
White smiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dad," said the little one, looking at the Lord with his big, bright eyes like stars. "Don't forget what you promised," said the little one. "When the morning returns to see the father and the master, he will return to the world of demons.
By the time, you will have the morning to the secret to refine.
When will I not keep my promise? When you come back, I will send you to the secret.
"All right.
The lovely smiled, the sun is more romantic.
Morning will try to raise strength, become the wings of the daughter, for the daughter to protect the wind from the rain.
His little face was full of firmness, and his big eyes were filled with firmness.
As long as he can protect his daughter, he is not afraid of the danger of that secret!
The white face wanted to stop the little white morning, see the little guy with the excited little face, stop the thing for a time but can not say the exit.
Emperor Xi, feeling the fear, he lifted his hand around her shoulder: "You don't have to worry, I won't put Morning in danger, and he is the prince of the fairy world, and the responsibility is to protect his mother and sister!
It's inevitable.
White stared at Emperor: Where is his sister?
Emperor's lips smiled, red lips to the ears of white, voice ambiguous, "If you want, you can have at any time..."
The most beautiful thing in the world is that I raise the child, but you say, if you want, you can have it at any time.
In that moment, thermal root of the white face, she coughed a little, twisted her head, did not look directly at Emperor's eyes full of desire.
It's not too early.I should go.
She thought of something, and looked up at the Emperor: And I have forgiven the two elders and the flame, and you need not trouble them any more.
Emperor's eyes were slightly wrinkled, and to be honest, had it not been for the two fools, he would not have left the house.
But...
Since Han decided to forgive the two, then he respected her decision!
Goodbye, Dad.
A goodbye to the Emperor, the white little morning, followed by the white face, entered the door.
"Wait.
Suddenly, a voice came from behind, a white step, turned his head to the pursued silver-and asked, Emperor, what else do you?
"I'll send you."
With laughter in the eyes of the Emperor, he came to the side of the white face, tightly holding her hand.
"All right.
She smiled,I'm not not coming back, why are you so nervous?
The King only wants to cherish every minute and every second with you.
She didn't let him, he respected her choice, but... he just wanted to be with her for a moment.
CHAPTER 838 Let Her Be Judge (2)
The little white morning walked silently behind the two, dissatisfied peeing lips, pale face full of frustration.
"How do I feel... after my daughters accepted the bad father, I became more of a man.
With big eyes, the dragon twisted curiously and looked at the little man who was beside him.
"Because normally, my cousins hug me, and since I had a bad father, if my cousins hug me, my father will throw me out...
"So I don't feel like I was born by a bad father..."
Daddy's real love, and he...
Estimated to be picked up?
The Holy Land, in a cloud, like a paradise.
Now the sacred place, the noise, the white face, as soon as I came out of the sacred place, I saw the people around the sacred place gate, her eyes shining with a vague, vague, self-speaking.
"What's going on here in the Holy Land?"
She hasn't come back for some time. Why have so many people come to the sanctuary?
Didn't you come to the holy place to elect disciples? Why didn't you know what had happened?
"And the Holy Seed disciples?"
The Holy Land was not just sent to select the disciples, why now to begin again?
It's hard to... what's really going on in the Holy Land?
"Ma'am," said the little white morning, "I want to see the father and the teacher. Can't we go ahead?"
"Go."
She carried a little white morning, a little dragon, She walked lightly, toward the gate of the Holy Place.
But there were too many people in front of her, so she had to pass through the crowds before she could go to the Holy Place.
Let go!
Suddenly, a hand stretched from the side, trying to push to the white face.
His white eyes converged, dragging the little morning's body to one side, hiding from the hand.
When the master of the hand saw this, and remembered to look back at a white face, he cried coldly, Did not see our fire-gate grandmother come, Idle man wait for us to go away!
Fire Gate is a two-fold sect, only after the existence of the monster sect, on this continent, also has a significant position.
So, as soon as the grandmother of the fire gate came, the men who were before her rushed away, and spread out on both sides, and opened a great way.
Under everybody's eyes, a woman in a big red dress came from behind, her arms wrapped with a silver long snake, her mouth with a smile, and she began to step forward.
Miss Flame, who is said to have been a reindeer, did she see the silver snake in her hand? It was her own reindeer.
"Well, according to her nature, it is estimated that even the demons will be forced to become disciples, but the fire cloud is the treasure of the fire gate, and it is impossible to go to the demons to become disciples."
There was a sigh, and the Miss of the Flame came to the place of admission, for they were afraid they had no chance.
Grandma, the aunt is very ugly, and she is very good at wearing red dresses. Only Grandma can dress in such a good color.
Among the silent crowd, a childish voice suddenly caught everyone's attention in a moment.
CHAPTER 839 Let Her Be The Judge (3)
His face was filled with uncomfortableness. His eyes stared deadly at the silver snake on his arm.
It's no wonder he didn't feel good about the cloud, first because the guards at the fire gate were too noisy, and then because of the relationship between the two sisters, White and Snow had no feeling for anybody in the Snake family!
The Silver S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
bold!
Therm's guard was very angry, and there were not many men on this earth who could be so angry with therm's maid!
This is a sacred place! No one is allowed to do anything without my command!
Thermal clouds are not indistinguishable, and she is not afraid to make a fuss at the gate of the sanctuary.
As for the mother of the child...
She must also come to the admission conference, when she will be on the field to find her account is enough!
Come on, my cousin should come and take us.
The cloud turned slowly, and at this moment she did not even notice that the white face had taken off the slack of her body.If she had not stopped the guard, she would have been afraid that the guard had just splashed blood.
Little Morning blinked his eyes and turned to look at the white face. Can Morning look for her trouble
A pale lips: People don't do me, I don't do people don't have to do you!
In other words, if these men offend the white morning, how did he deal with it, she would not ask!
As soon as thermal clouds had reached the gate, they saw a man in the gate, who greeted them and went to the thermal clouds with joy.
My Sister,you are here at last.
"My brother, my father should have told you that I too was here to attend the meeting of the invited disciples, and I hope that my brother-in-law will do more.
"HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa
Their cousin is in the holy place.
And I also heard that Lin's father was going to be one of the judges who selected the disciples.
The girl's son just blamed her, and I'm afraid this time they won't be able to pass.
Without speaking, he listened silently to the conversation of the men, but his eyes did not freely frown.
She washed the Holy Place before because she had cheated, she didn't think there would be any cheating.
Morning, it seems that is the time for us to return.
A shallow lip corner.
Nevertheless, she had to inform the Master of what was happening here, to give the Master more attention than to try.
She didn't want to see the same thing in the Holy Land!
After that said, the white face, with the hand of the white little morning and the dragon, passed through the crowd to the gate of the holy place.
CHAPTER 840 Let Her Be Judge (4)
And before she came, she sent a letter unto the Master, saying, Yea, the Master commanded the guards, and gave them her image; and when the two guards saw that she was come white, and had not examined her invitation, they let her go into the holy place.
"This is...
Why didn't the girl use the invitation?
"Isn't she also in the sanctuary?
"I think that is the case," or "Why is she so brave as to yell at the girl of fire?"
Their voices weren't passed through the ears of the far-off, and when they were away from the crowd, the cloud stopped, and bit the lips: "Brother, did you see the woman who just had two children?"
Lin, surprised, asked,What's up?
"The woman's son is so ashamed of me that I wish he had chosen a disciple rather than a trial.
She can drop directly!
The cloud bit the teeth, the underside of the eyes flashed a cold.
This little thing is not difficult for an elder brother-in-law.
My Sister, I will not give you a chance to advance, said Lin, without laughing.And he thought how great it was, that little thing, for him, was light and easy
As soon as she entered the white face of the sanctuary, she did not hear the conversation between the clouds and the cold, nor did she go in any other direction than they did, and went straight to the sanctuary.
Since her departure from the sanctuary, she has given the sanctuary entirely to several princes, and at this time, the prince must be on the sanctuary waiting for him.
Far away, the white face saw the three old men chatting, her color was warm, the corner of the lips raised a smile.
After arriving on this continent, the three teachers gave her too much warmth, and also when they were in her most difficult time, extended to her help hand...
At the first sight of the white, eyes lit, stood up in a moment, are you back?
His words made the Master Zheng and the three Masters Chu Shu-yun also returned to God, surprised to look at the big and the small that came to them.
"Yes, this little girl is the one you were looking for before?" said Chu, with his mouth shut. "But why didn't you leave the phantom and say something to us?
Unless your grandfather tells us, we don't know you're gone.
White smiled as if he were laughing: "Three Masters, how is your alchemy? Do you remember what I taught you the last time?"

"Well, you three teachers are too stupid to ask such a simple question, son of a bitch, you should teach him hard!"
Hu's old face turned red, angrily looking at the two losers: "You two old things, if I don't sell them, I'll die?"
Seeing the three fathers fighting with the other two old men, he smiled, "Well, this time I'm not coming to check your alchemists, I have something to say to you.
"What is it?"
At one point,the three old men turned their eyes to white.
The Lord said to me before... I want to go.
But if you come out of the sanctuary, not only will there be many upgrades, but even the heart will be a qualitative upgrade.
This time, for the Emperor, for the evil world, she willing to venture!
CHAPTER 841 Let Her Be The Judge (5)
"You're going to the sanctuary," said Cheng, looking at the white face with astonishment. "I'm going to have a discussion with the Lord about this. After all, if you do anything, not only will our three old men not survive, but the sanctuary will suffer great losses.
"Well," said White, "I haven't seen him for a long time, and I want to see him with you, and I want to know something else.
White looked at him and said, Why is the sanctuary inviting the disciples?
"It's like...
"The recent continent is not very flat, and the three powers have felt the crisis, and are going to select the most talented people from the world and send them to the small sanctuary.
There are two parts of the sanctuary, one is the small sanctuary, white face once, and the other, is the real sanctuary, commonly called the mirror of the nine deaths of life.
But no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
"Because he's going to his mother's sanctuary, this time's trial must be fair, and there must be no more abuses," said Zheng with a soft kiss of his chin.
"When it comes to this, I really want to say to you that you have just come back, that the Lord has just said that you should be the judge.
"I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "I" "
It takes days to open the sanctuary, and the rest of the time, you have just come to be the judge, and you will be the only judge this time.
"Why don't you act as a judge?"
As a Judge?
It's awkward. They've got sick brains to do it.
There are parts of our alchemy that are not well-known and need to be studied, so it is not in this world.
Their eyes turned, and they thought of an excuse.
What about Chu?
"Let the Master be the judge," she said, "and do you think that those women have more leisure than to try?
"What about Chu?
Can't Chu, can't this girl?
"She? Of course not! Because of the girl's crazy character, the whole trial will be made by her smoke, maybe she's not in the mood, and will burn the ring.
All in all, these elders say one thing: this trial must be held by White!
She suddenly felt that she had the wrong time to come back
"Can I refuse?" she asked in a weak voice.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
With a determined expression, let not white face continue to refuse.
"My daughter," said the young morning, with his big eyes shining, "and the young morning wants to be his assistant.
Dragon looked at the white face, looked at the white little morning, the eyes contained the light of expectation.
She also wants to help the Queen.
"I'll tell you about it later. I'll go see the Lord and the cloak.
His face wasted, he asked.
Their faces were stiff, and they sighed.
CHAPTER 842 Let Her Be Judge (6)
The Master was once a lover of White, but White had chosen the Emperor, so, soon before, he had already left the sacred place to heal...
When she saw the expression of the three old, the white face knew the answer, she felt a sense of guilt.
Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go
"Mr.
"You are always my father," said the white face, with a smile in his mouth.
"Haha!"
Zheng laughed and said,What do I regret for having said this?Go, the Lord has not seen you for a long time, he has been talking about you coming back, I will take you to see him first!
Inside.
The table was full of mess, and Chu was eating a chicken leg, and her mouth was full of oil, and the man beside her was holding a barrel, and the handsome face was full of drunken red light.
"Dad, did you bring back the white face? "Dad," said Chu, "Dad, did you bring back the white face?""Dad," said he.
Chen raised his hand without disputing, and dropped a hand on the front of his robe.
"It's a good wine," said Cheng. "I've given it to you, so don't think about it again," said Chu. "As for the girl with the white face," said Cheng, "she'll be back in a few days."
"Oh.
Chu's eyes were shining and his face was smiling. That's good. I've got to write a letter to my brother and let him come back.
Even though White had accepted the Emperor, but... the man knew his brother, and he was satisfied to see her at a glance.
She's a sister and she's going to let her brother.
As Chen was about to speak, an old man rushed in from outside the door, arching his fist with respect, and said, Lord, little princess, Cheng has risen, and... the white-faced girl has also come.
This elder, who is with the Lord, is naturally aware of the existence of a white face, except that, since the days of the white face, everyone knows that the three elders of Zheng have received a disciple, but they know that they have never seen a white face.
She stood before them, and they knew not that she was the master of the island, the three old disciples.
'What?' 'She's back?' 'So fast?' 'Churn got up in panic, looked at the mess on the table, waved quickly, took all the wine on the table into his sack, and pulled out a clean cloak, and, without forgetting to take a dose of Dan medicine, went to the taste of the wine in his mouth.
Chu looked at her dress, her face still full of stains, the food in her mouth had not been swallowed, and the dress was dirty.
"She has a habit!" "She has a habit of cleaning!" "She has a habit of cleaning!"
It's too late.
Just as Chu was standing by the table, Zheng had walked in with a white face from outside.
At first, falling into the eyes of the white, it was the little face of Chu clothes dirty.
Suddenly, her eyebrows froze.
Clothes, your room washed with smoke, and now you come to defile the Lord's room? She wiped her cloths, and after smelling the wine in her mouth, she asked, Have you been drinking? Have you forgotten about the last time you were drunk and almost burned my sacred island?
"No, no, it's my father..."
Cheung wants to cry.
But as soon as she had finished her words, the one on the other side coughed in a hurry and interrupted the next thing she was about to say.
Chapter 843 The Father
Clothes, I warned you before, that a girl should behave well, that you should eat not only meat, but also drink!
Chu looked stupid, she said weakly, "I have a drink..."
'What?' 'You've had a pot?' 'You've had a pot,' said Chu, angrily pointing to his shirt, with a cold voice.
You were so generous when I didn't notice!
In particular, dare to drink in my room, let in the room all taste of wine!
How do I sleep today?
With her eyes widened, she did not believe in the harsh look of the god, and suddenly there was an impulse to cry.
She obviously drank a bite, why did the father put her in?
What are you looking for me?
Chen's eyes turned to white, the original harsh look was a little soft.
She's been hiding from him ever since he planned to be a mediator for his son. Now it's all right to go to the Three Temples. She can't come to him unless there's a deal!
"Lord," you said, "I was able to enter the real sanctuary by the work I had done in the small sanctuary, but I was in a hurry to leave the sanctuary, so I had not chosen to enter the sanctuary, and I didn't know whether I could go in now or not."
In fact, for four years, she spent two years in the sanctuary, and she was qualified to go to the real sanctuary by exceeding the limits of her qualifications.
But she could not rest, and so left the holy place and went to the White House. Now, if she could have this opportunity, she must have gone to the holy place to raise her strength.
Chu was surprised, frowning, "Do you want to go to the sanctuary?"
"That's right.
Their faces do not change color.
"I've said you can go to the sacred place," said Chu. "But the crisis you've experienced in the sacred place is hundreds of times more dangerous than it is in the sacred place!"
But the best way to raise your strength is because of the danger of the sanctuary, said Cheng, looking straight at the white face, "In addition, the sanctuary is laid down very slowly, that is, you spend a year in the sanctuary, outside it is a month!
White's silenced, and continued to listen to Chu's explanation.
"Now I want to know if you really are going to the sanctuary, are you not afraid of danger?"
"I'm sure!"
There is no doubt in the dark eyes of the white.
"Well, I respect your choice, but it takes a lot of time to open the sanctuary, and I have to get people ready," said Chuen with a smile, slowly walked to the side of the white face, gently clapped on her shoulder, with a voice of regret, "Unfortunately, I used to see you as my daughter-in-law, but now, you are married to someone else... but, you are not my daughter-in-law, but also my daughter!
"The Lord..."
His eyes were white, and he stared at the man standing before him.
There's nothing more to be said than to incite, my daughter, and I'd be satisfied if half of you were to let go.
Why did she get so disliked?
It's true that child is always the good of the other family, she is only a devalued existence...

"What is it?"
"In this trial, I want to recommend Yang to be the judge, and I don't know what the Holy Spirit will do?"
When Zheng heard this, he turned to look at the white face, and asked, "Lam white, can you accept your father's proposal?"
"How long does it take to open the sanctuary? "How long does it take to open the sanctuary?"
"It takes a month to open the sanctuary, and in that month, the trial will surely end."
"Well," the white eyes flashed for a few seconds, raising a smile, "that's the judge's assignment, I've taken it.
"HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa
She seemed to remember what had been done to her father, and to say a few words, and the warning eyes of Chu were cleared.
That means, If you dare to employ me, you are done!
Maybe Chu's eyes were too dreadful, and Chu's clothes were shaking as if he didn't dare to say what had just happened.
Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co Co
He arched his fist and then dragged his face out to the door.
After half a sound, already disappeared into the room.
Looking at the two leaving, Chuan quietly took a breath, he lifted his hand and gently touched his lower chest.
Afterwards, he raised his hand, and the dishes that had just been removed from him appeared again on the table.
Clothes, we go.
He laughed twice and waved his sleeves into the seat.

She shivered and ran out of the room, and of course she had no courage to sell her father.
During these days, there was much noise within the sanctuary, only to prevent the disciples who were being chosen from affecting the disciples of the sanctuary, namely, those who could only stay in a small house outside the gate, without the life of the sanctuary, and those who could not step out.
At this time, in a small room in the yard, a woman in a long red dress came and paced, her hands rubbed gently, and her face was filled with anxiousness; and, behold, the door was pushed open, and, as she turned her head, she saw a handsome man coming out of the door, and, at once, her eyes brightened, and she greeted him with speed.
"My brother, what did your teacher say? Did he agree to help us?
"I'm afraid my father won't be able to help you this time," said Lin.
Fan Yun's look of joy and madness had just stopped, and she stared at the handsome face of the man before her: Why, cousin, your master is in a high position, why can't he help us?
Isn't he willing to help me?
CHAPTER 845
Sister, you have misunderstood, not that my Master did not help you, but that it happened suddenly, and the Holy Land chose another judge,
The judge was quite mysterious, and I spent half a day without hearing who she was.
Lin's face wasted with bitterness, and who knew that would happen suddenly.
As he heard, the cloud fell, and his face was slightly white.
In fact, only she knows, her talents, are blown out of the fire door, can not be compared with the other school of genius disciples!
Even her silver snake had not been subjected to her, but had been subjected to her by an elder in the school, and she had herself subjected to her.
And because she wears her hidden powers, barely on the outside, that is, those who do not know her true powers...
And more importantly, she wants to brush the woman with the old man's hand!
As soon as she thought of a collision with her own, she hated tooth-cuts, so she could never give the little boy's mother a chance!
"Uncle, can you help me with who's next to the judge? As soon as I know who she is, I'll be sure to help her.
Thern held his fist tightly, lifted his head, and looked with prayerful eyes at Lin.
Looking at the poor look of her own cousin, Lin's heart was soft, but at the end she was helpless.
"The Holy Land is very secret to the judge, and my father does not know who has come, I only know...
The little princess of the sanctuary, will also be present at the match, as the assistant of the judge.
Their bodies were stiff, and even the sacred princess was only deputy, and the judge... what was that?
"But, sister, don't worry. This time, besides the judge and the little princess, there are some disciples from the Holy Land who are coming to help them.
" After all, such a big trial, as a referee, can't take account of the whole thing, and when he does, I will let him move his hands and feet in the dark, so that you can succeed in winning."
Finally, she took a breath, and lifted her fist, and hammered down her cold chest, "Brother, you have all thought for me, why don't you tell me sooner?
Yes, yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
The girl's fist dropped softly on his chest. Then he saw the other's snow-white neck.
He swallowed his saliva, and said,I've got people looking for you, and I'm not going to let you down.
"I'm sure of my cousin," said thee shyly, his collar narrow, his neck red, his face shy, "but he still hoped his cousin would let them down, and I didn't want to see any more of them on the field.
"Haha!"
Lina smiled with two voices, and held the hand of the flame.My sister, since the people who came here were invited from the holy places, I cannot brush the woman directly, but...
CHAPTER 846
He squinted a little, and a cold mark flashed from beneath his eyes, and laughed silently, "I have a way to make her name, and once her name is broken, she will surely be away from the Holy Land, and she will never be able to compete with you again!"
Isn't it easy to deal with a woman who is a disciple of the Holy Land?
If you can make your cousin happy, what about abuse of power?
As the three days passed, those who came to participate in the trial also came from all the powers, and now are gathered in the meeting place.
Thermal Cloud was the brightest among the guards, and she had no more shyness in the face of the cold, and all of them had a kind of cold arrogance, and her face was frozen, and her eyes were cold, and she looked at the noisy crowd before her, and her eyes were gradually unbearable.
Only, her eyes were circled, and she still saw no white face, and her eyes were involuntarily twisted together.
"Miss!"
Suddenly, the waiter on the side said,The woman is here.
As soon as he saw the crowd, a large two small three gently walked.
Under the sun at noon, the woman in the red coat, as the foot walks lightly, the foot walks lightly, her face is colorless, is to describe the four words of the bright crown of the world, are very appropriate.
The girl had a little boy in the left hand, with a purple robe, and it was hard to imagine that the little handsome bag had had such a powerful air.
On the right is a sweet little girl, her body sweet smile, with a childlike sweet smile, with a bend of eyes like the moon teeth, Anyone who has seen such sweet little girl, can not help to soften the heart.
"The woman is here at last!"""""You remember what I said to you before?""
The waiter nodded in a hurry. The maid's orders, the slave remembered well.
"Okay," said thermal laugh. "My cousin is right," he said. "I should let this woman... break her name!"
As White took the two children to the height, suddenly, a satirical voice came to stop her steps suddenly.
The people now are so shameless, they don't have any real education, they dare to take part in the trials, and they want to bribe the judges, and you think that by bribing others, they can get people to vote safely?
With a wrinkled eyebrow, she loosened her hands with the dragon, and turned a little, and looked over her face from the cloud of fire, to the waiter who had just opened her mouth.
"You were just... talking about me?"
The waiter laughed and said, I have not wronged you; I have seen the things that I have seen myself; I have seen that you have been tempted to bribe the disciples of the Holy Land; but where are you, the disciples of the Holy Land, that you may not be tempted?
Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little
Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss
CHAPTER 847
These were the answers given by Fan Yun and Xiaoling, who naturally remembered all that had to be said, and the expression of disapproval which had made all the believers in her words.
"What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" "
If you do such a thing, you must be ashamed of your own sect!
The crowded, and all looked at the white face with disgust, and even more, the man who had just stood beside her suddenly pushed away, afraid of being defiled by the woman.
The little dragon's face was red, and she wanted to tear up the woman's evil mouth, but a hand stretched out beside her and held her tightly.
"The Queen..."
She turned her head, and looked at the white face, and the little eyeman did not forget to stare at the lord of the cloud.
This time, there was no such impulse as the dragon. His little mouth had drawn a shadowy arc, and his big eyes flashed, "The dragon, you wait for the play to be done.
Are these people trying to get their daughters?
So before they do this, can they make sure they have their identities?
Didn't you know where the disciple was, could you call him out? Her white lips wandered with laughter, looking at the cloud of fire.
Thermal clouds cast a glance at the queen who was beside them, and the queen stood up, and cleansed her throat, and said, Will you, Prince, come out to testify, that if such a woman come into the holy place, she will surely defile this holy place.
At the moment when the voice fell, not far from the high rise, a man in robes came out, with a single hand on his back, smiling toward the crowd.
"I'm not going to say anything about this, after all, it's not very good,"
With a smile, said Justice, but, since the maid of the fire, I must have come out to testify.
Liang's eyes slowly turned to white, his eyebrows slightly wrinkled, and he said with a great heart, I know that you are not very talented, so hasty, and in order to choose this side, but my Liang Liang is very seated to come, and it is not possible to sell my own wisdom for it!
Ask the girl to go away!
His smile just disappeared, his face serious, even his expression was extremely solemn.
This Uncle.
Suddenly, there was a voice of milk, which made Liang's eyes tighter and tighter, and looked down at the little pack of milk that came before him.
"Uncle, has your daughter taught you that a bad child who tells a lie will be terrible!"
As Liu changed his face and said coldly, "It is no wonder that the daughter is a kind of virtue, and that the child is too rude, indeed, what kind of person, what kind of child to give.
The white morning smiled, however, in his big fox eyes through a cold mark.
Uncle, uncle, only tell you, that bad child will be very miserable, if uncle did not lie, that uncle's word is not against you, or uncle is afraid?
CHAPTER 848
The crowd at this moment is very quiet to drop the needle.
These people have no doubt about the disciples of the sanctuary, but the child was really polite, and he claimed not to have been educated!
After dropping the word, he turned to the side of the white face, he raised the pink face, the big eyes with the bright light.
Daughter, Morning had warned him, but he did not seem to have listened to him, so that Daughter would not have to be kind to him.
"I'll give you another chance. Are you sure that what you just said is true?"
What does this woman mean?
However, thinking of the recently very uncomfortable, Liang Jiang bit his teeth: "I Liang Jiang never lie!
In those years Liang had no fewer bribes, and he had been lucky to escape the cleansing before, and now the Holy Place has begun the cleansing again, he can not do without his own intentions.The reason for the promise was not that he had received the bribe, but that he was trying to prove himself with it.
Look, how could such a good man come to him, and he could refuse without changing his face, and he was such a good man, how could he take any other bribe?
"Well, well, I've given you a chance, and you still are, so...
"Whatever the result is yours," said Liang, with his cold face, and without knowing why, she began to feel anxious, a feeling that made his heart move beyond control.
Liang, under the core disciple Qing Hong, in this trial, is responsible for controlling the weapons needed in the trial...
"Then I wanted to bribe you, didn't you give me the best weapon?"
"Yes," said Liu, "you not only let me give you the best weapons, but also let me put my hands on the other weapons, and I will not be able to do such an act of treason!"
Everyone enters the sanctuary and is not allowed to carry weapons, even those that are needed for testing, and are issued by the sanctuary for the sake of equity.
Just...
"You said I had no power," said the white face with a sudden smile. "Are you forgetting a word, that in the presence of absolute power, even the instruments of divinity are of no use.
God is very powerful, but, for example, a newcomer to the army, fights with the nobles, even if she has God?
So, arms are important, but real power, more important!
Liang wasted, and he forgot to ask White why she knew she was assigned to the command of the weapons, after all, only the heart of the sanctuary knew, and the others only knew that he was also involved in the trial.
"The rainbow hasn't come yet? Now let him come to see me!"
White smiled coldly, this time more than a trial, in addition to the robes of Chu, Cheng had two core disciples come to help, and this Liangyuan, was the hand of the blue rainbow!
She didn't think any more that Liu would take her as a contestant, and... also accused her.
CHAPTER 849 She Is Mystery
Outside the crowd, a delicate voice came from behind, and the people who had been noisy suddenly returned to silence.
What are you all doing around here?
A girl dressed in a yellow dress frowned, and her speech seemed to be unbearable.
Before the moment she appeared, all the people around her were dispersed on both sides.
The disciples in the holy place have not seen the white face, but no one knows that is called the little princess of the witch,
So, looking at her appearance, Liang no longer faced with white face, the handsome face raised a smile.
Little Princess,,,,,,,,BroBroBroBroBroBroBroBro,,,,,,,,,You're all here now?When's it going to start?
Now.
Chu's elegant dress picked eyebrows, smiling eyes turned to white.
She was about to go to the white face, Liang's voice again from the side.
Little Princess, aren't we waiting for the judge?
After a few steps, she twisted her head and frowned, Isn't she already here? Who do you want to wait for?
It's strange that white face is already here. Who do they want to wait for?
Liang shut his eyes and the judge had come, why did he not receive the message?
She turned again, laughing, and walked to her white face, with a shining smile on her handsome little face.
"Byeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeye
Liang, who was in the crowd searching for the mysterious judge, suddenly saw the cloak before the white face, and heard her words, immediately thought of a possibility.
This possibility made his body stiff, his face suddenly pale, his fists tightly held shaking slightly, his eyes unbelievingly open.
Brother, this woman is.
The young man who was accompanied by Chu looked into Liang's eyes, clearly not aware of why Liang's reaction was so intense, but nodded slightly: She is the judge, what, do you not know?
His voice was not light, but in the quiet of the meeting, so sudden, as a weight, hit the hearts of all.
Their bodies were shaking a few times, and they needed to be supported by the girl beside them, to avoid falling to the ground.
But...
Her white fingers gripped her heart and paralyzed herself with pain.
This woman is not a disciple to be tested, but a mysterious judge whom the Lord has sought this time?
My cousin didn't say he'd seen all the high-ranking disciples of the Holy Land, but why didn't he see this woman?
"Wait.
She lifted her hand and stopped her movement, her eyes lightly sweeping toward Liang, and a cold smile wandered on her lips.
"You said I wasted my talent?"
That was enough tos the unknown, and she was surprised with her bright eyes, and her eyes turned a little toward Liu.
Is there a genius in this world?
White faced Liu with two steps closer: You said I would bribe you to succeed in this trial, right?
Chu's eyes were as big as copper's, and she had come only a moment later, how could such a great thing have happened?
CHAPTER 850 She's the Mystic Judge
"I...
After being forced back two steps, a layer of cold sweat on his forehead, his legs were shaking, almost kneeling.
Until Liu had a suitable excuse, the voice of the furious cloak, this time, directly made Liu Liu kneeling down, a smell of urine spread throughout the meeting.
Liang, you are so brave, it is not easy to agree to be a judge, you dare to accuse him! Moreover, with the talent, all of you together, are not her opponent!
Who gave you the courage?
White
White?
Liang had no thought, but now, when he heard the words of Chu, he suddenly realized that the name was familiar, as if he had heard it from somewhere.
Suddenly, his eyes slowly dropped on the small bag beside the white face, wide eyes, in the eyes of fear and panic.
Shortly before, he heard a rumor that sacred island's lord, was the lord of the medicine gate, the granddaughter of the long wind, and she was always accompanied by a long and very lovely son!
It's just that he never heard of her existence, didn't really see her, so for a time he didn't think about the woman.
If she were really smiling, what he had just said would be so ridiculous!
Willow shivered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Likewise, they were silent, but their eyes were on the white face, and their brushes were cast on him, and his eyes were filled with contempt and satire.
The girl's position in the sanctuary is obviously very high, otherwise the little princess could not be willing to serve as her deputy, but Liu, an inner disciple of the sanctuary, who could not even count the core, dare to claim that she bribed him with beauty in order to enter the sanctuary?
It's ridiculous!
Princess,I know I am wrong,I really know I am wrong," said Liang with a sharp knock and tears in his face,"It was Lin that made me do this,I am only a helper, and the real culprit is he.
Lin Lin Lin Lin Lin Lin Lin Lin Lin Lin Lin Lin Lin Lin Lin
"He...
He is also a disciple in the holy place, and a teacher with me.
"Oh, that's what got him out of the holy place. We don't need such a man in the holy place."
Their fate was determined by Chu's waving.
After dropping the word, she laughed and turned to her white face, and blinked her eyes slightly:
How do I deal with this?
You'll do it yourself.
No, chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu chu
In fact, it is clear that little princess of her sanctuary needs to listen to the words of the white face, and you of the sanctuary disciples dare to trouble her? Believe it or not, she told her father that he had not lost the power to get out of the sanctuary so easily.
Lin, who was always looking at the situation, turned to flee, and he had to flee in the future, and was stopped by a group to go, one of the hands waved in his chest, to blow him in front of the white face and the Chu coat.
CHAPTER 85 She Is Mystery Judge
Chu's hands waist, cheerful people look down on the ground of Lin's cold, cynical smile: "Before the white face let Zheng to the old to clean the holy place, I didn't think there is such a worm, my holy place is very fair trial, never allow any kind of fornication!
Sister Chu, walked a few steps forward, with a gleaming smile in his eyes, This is Lin, the cousin of the evil aunt, and... before the evil aunt and the morning had caused a dispute outside the temple, the morning doubted that everything was her fault.
He raised his chin and pointed at the cloud of fire.
Two Steps behind the black cloud, her eyes were frightened, and she hurried with her look of help to Lin, her eyes filled with the stars of tears.
"No, it's not about my sister," said Lin, biting her teeth. "My sister is innocent, and it's all my own fault, and I've got her maid! I'm just trying to piss her off, not thinking about her, and I'm hoping the little princess will give me a chance.
When he was discovered, the greatest punishment was to leave the sanctuary, but if the sister were revealed, even if the sanctuary had done nothing to her, the father of the sister would not have easily let her go!
Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy!
Come on!
The waiter also knelt, knocked hard, a trace of blue and black on the forehead, blood leaking out of the brain gate, flowing to the ground.
"All this, indeed, is the reason for my communication with you; it is not with you; please let go of her; she is innocent..."
Her eyes were filled with tears, and her face was pale, but her eyes were filled with choice.
If she had resisted all the charges, she would have been as hard to escape as her brother who lived in the flames if she had died.
So she can't hire the girl.
When the two had all the blame on themselves, the cloud quietly loosened her mouth, she bit her teeth, took the first step, kneeled to the white face, and stared at her with tears.
"Girl, I know you've made a big mistake for me, and this time it's really me who can't teach the maid, my cousin.
And I'll never admit what I didn't do. And I hope that white girl won't let your son hurt me again.
Her words were earnest, full of prayer, as if she were really wronged.
Chang turned his face to the white face, to tell the truth, compared to this woman, she believed more white little morning.
Would you like to continue with the trial?
His white lips picked up an arc, smiling and gazing at the girl kneeling in front of him, right?
Their face was white, their cousin had planted, and she continued to stay, this time more than the results of the test.
But now that's the case, she can't pull back.
"Yes."
"Well," said the white face, "I'll take the jade from your neck, and I'll let you stay for a while."
What?
Their eyes were as white as snow, and they were filled with confusion.
How would she know?
"It is what my daughter left me before she died," said the cloud with his head lowered and his panic covered his eyes, "she had promised me that I would not take the jade, or that I would not respect her, and that she would not... want to force me?"
CHAPTER 85 She Is Mystery Judge
The disciples of the sanctuary, even in the dark, would not dare to act in the open, and now, under the great public, the woman would not be more able to force her to take off her jade.
So that's why fire is brave to see without seeing.
Unfortunately, she forgot the person in front of her, one was the little princess of the Holy Land, and the other... even the little princess would listen to the life.
Thus, when the word of the cloud came down, she took her jacket, which she had carried around her neck, and slammed it into the ground.
"The white face let you take off the jade and you take off, what do you do with so much?"
She stared at the cloud, and said without feeling.
Everyone was shocked by Chu's behavior, and looked at the clouds of sympathy.
But...
As thermal clouds have said, this jade is her daughter's legacy, and to her it is a thought, yet the little princess of the sacred place is so mighty, that she has struck her jade directly.
Look at the clouds, all become a black, obviously sad.
In fact, the pale of the clouds, not because of grief, but because of fear, she stared at the jade that was thrown to the ground, and a panic appeared in her eyes.
It's over. This time, she's all over...
"Oh, no, I heard that the great lady of the flame has reached the rank of king, and that besides the three powers, she is the most genius person in the whole world, why now her power shows is the middle rank of the earth?"
Their talent is not high, but it is not low. The Prince's southern wing broke into the rank of a genius.
After all,the southern wing was the prince of the land of fire, and a prince's younger brother, whose refined resources could not be compared to a two-way school, was, that firefly was so talented, that it was not a genius; and, moreover, firefly lived to promote firefly's talents, and, when it was hard to do, called her a great genius.
A young man who broke through the kingdom, is indeed a genius, unfortunately...
This genius is false!
Clothes, said the white, as far as I know, who enters the sanctuary as a test, must be of the least strength and of the highest rank!
Although Zheng sent posts to the main factions, if you want to succeed in the sanctuary, it is necessary to pass through a layer of screening, only the power to reach the lowest target, is qualified to hold the invitation to enter the sanctuary.
A man who hasn't achieved even the minimum goal, how to enter the sacred place? fear is the question worth all thinking.
"What's the matter?
She looked at herself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Blue Rainbow felt a cold sweat on his lower forehead: "The one who went before to select the major powers was Long Lin."
Lin, who is he?
asked Chu in anger.
"Yes..." The Blue Rainbow swept down on the knees of Linanan, "This is Linanan's teacher."
As the crowded, the sights gathered on the clouds fell on the cold of Lin.
Linan shivered, realizing that time, he and his father had escaped!
CHAPTER 85 She Is Mystery Judge
"Let him come to see me!" "Let him come to see me!" "Let him come to see me!" "Let him come to see me!" "Let him come to see me!" "Let him come to see me!" "Let him come to see me!" "Let him come to see me!" "Let him come to see me!"
"Yes, little princess."
The Guardian ordered her to retreat, and her words had essentially confirmed the destiny of the Rinchen Dorm...
"You," said one of the other guards, pointing at the other side, and raising his snow-white chin, "you will drag him down with this Lin-and wait for him to deal with it!
Lin, lying cold and paralyzed, closed his eyes a little, opened them a little, and fell on a cloudless face, and laughed helplessly.I'm afraid this time he won't be able to help her.
Little Princess.
Liang, with a panic up, and again knee in front of them, with force knocking.
It's not knowing it's broken.
"I know I am wrong, please forgive me this time, and I will not dare again."
"Forgive me," said the young man with a cold smile, staring at the kneeling man with a soft look, "If I were not the judge of this game, would your betrayal have succeeded?"
Liang paused, indeed, if White had not been a judge, but merely an ordinary disciple, perhaps she had already been driven out of the sanctuary by him, and had lost her name.
"So, if you change to another, how will it be next time, I don't have to say, you know," said the white foot, stepping harshly on the lily's head, stepping his head on the ground, with a cold voice, "And how can you, such as you, forgive how many excellent disciples yourselves have lost when we don't know?"
Neither thermal, nor was this sacred place her home.
She did not allow anyone in her place to be deceived, nor did she allow the Holy Land to be deceived by their actions.
Today, she will kill chickens and keep the sacred land from getting back to peace!
Bang!
White's foot kicked into Liang's head, and for a moment Liang's body flew out, crashed into a column on the side, and his mouth bleeded, and his face was pale, and without color.
His eyes were widened by fear, and he could not resist seeing the red coat of the attacker fly before his eyes.
P P P
White's fingers caught Liang's arm, twisted with force, and all heard only a crippling sound of the bone, he again poured out a red blood, and swung, and a cries of tearing hearts and lungs sounded out of the sky, and the hair froze.
My Holy, I have always been fair, and I will never allow anything to happen to me!
White returned, shot a sword light in the sleeve, directly shot the lanyard contained Dan, in a moment, he Dan exploded, his body paralyzed on the ground.
Until then, the three priests had cleansed the sacred places, unfortunately, the threat was not enough, only to expel the violators out, Yes, there are still people willing to risk!
Chapter 1064
Even on the frozen north, there was a riot on their own territory which the Finnish authorities could not have known, but which the Finnish authorities remained quite silent about.
The trouble was brought by the arrows, and it was on their "private" territory, and since the dead were not Finns, and the arrowsss had not made any pleas for help, what was the matter with them?
This is no longer a problem they can deal with from the equipment in the hands of these rebels.
At once, the commander of Partak decided to mobilize the local militia to deploy the defenses in the town and to do everything possible to ensure the safety of the town.
The facts prove that was his choice.
Less than half an hour later, a document was issued urging local police to do their utmost to protect the small town of Partak, and sending a special force to assist.
As for the refugee camps, they will be taken over by the Finnish Defence Forces, hundreds of kilometres away.
Name.
Through information from the Russian Security Agency, Jiang had the news.
The Finnish officials remained silent to his surprise. He had no idea how the Finnish had to send a rapid counter-force to stabilize, but he did not expect their reaction to be so calm.
Looks like this Camen ten eight nine again in this military base, has done something unspeakable.
Or do you think there's enough to get rid of the ugly?
No matter what Camen's reaction, the plans on this side of Jiangshan are being carried out on a department-by- department basis.
Most of these refugees are from the Middle East, and many of them have been involved in militia organizations or have been recruited as reserves and received basic military training.
It is certainly impossible to expect these people to open tanks, but there is plenty to do with compulsory artillery, at least not to throw artillery on their own heads.
As the second set of equipment entered the Partak area, Sami, with the rapid accumulation of prestige, drew a 10,000-strong guerrilla from the camp, and mobilized the entire camp and the arrow company to a decisive battle "only with the complete annihilation of the atheist army can the oppressive rule be ended".
A box of ammunition was loaded onto the broken bread trucks and trucks, and the workers took electrical welds from the factory, welded the heavy machine guns onto the skin trucks.
Undoubtedly, the U's had no fighting power at all, and under the same conditions had little to do with the regular-trained mercenaries, but Jiang's confidence in the end of the war was full.
The reason is simple.
It's not enough to fire!
At 2 a.m., six hours had passed since the outbreak of the riot, only 2,000 men remained in the defence, and the armed Samurai once again marched in the direction of the arrow company, preparing to "rescue" the misguided compatriots.
The large army marched to the mosque two kilometers outside the arrow company, dispersed and surrounded the military base.
Under the command of some old men who had been on the battlefield, the armed men with their shovels and their hoes dug out a simple armored pit, hundreds of mortars, set up dozens of armored fields, and with the raising of a signal, hundreds of mortars swung through the whole mosque, and a cluster of exploded lights covered the whole armored field, turning the distressed armored mercenaries.
Of course, the mercenaries staying in the military base were not hungry, and the first time they encountered the artillery, all the mercenaries rushed to the cover.
At the same time, grenades inside the military base, according to coordinates of the reconnaissance troops, began counter-attack against the mob.
However, these shell positions were too dispersed, and the bullets thrown from all sides made the artillery in the military base exhausted.
Although they were all experts on guns, they nevertheless faced more than ten times his number.
A mortar dropped on the headquarters and blew up a corner of the concrete defense.
Their face washed away by the dust of the ceiling, and Colonel Ano stood by the table, watching out the window screaming.
"Set! Why are these bugs getting so many guns?"
Suddenly, the guns hit all, and they thought that they were going to fight with rifles and their machine guns, but they didn't think that they were going to fight with their support.
"There is no doubt that is the circle trade that sent them," said Sardes, leaning against the table before returning to the tactical map, looking round at all those present, "Men, we can't keep up, and no one knows exactly how many cannons they have, for the man who supplied them with weapons was an unrelenting mixer.
Arnold, take your men out to deal with them, and tell them that modern war cannot be solved only by numbers.
"Yes!"
Arnold was marching, took the counter from the arrow, and began to order the units at all levels.
Upon command, the military gates were opened, and dozens of Humboldt cars rushed out, followed by four "American Lion" armored cars, toward the rebels' positions.
At the command of Jiangshan, Samurai ordered his men to carry a guerrilla force of two thousand men, and to carry a box of anti-armored weapons, and the front line of the battle was on the edge of the pine forest, where the two pine trees were.
After encountering the rioters, the arrows company Hummer and armored cars immediately dropped their speed, holding up the heavy machine gun welded to the top of the car, and fired a bowl-sized bullet at the crowd of the riots.
The mercenaries who sat in the car jumped to find a cover for the riot and the people started to fire.
However, they clearly underestimated the anti-armed capabilities of the mob.
Just as the mercenaries were sweeping with their machine guns, all kinds of high-explosive, armored RPGs were flying in a frenzy among the forests.
Of course, these are still not enough to compensate for the riots. In the war, although the armed units of the arrow company were not able to cope with the sudden attack of the RPG, even without armed cars, these rebels were not regular armed opponents.
In less than ten minutes of fighting between the two sides, the Samis have killed more than two hundred, and the arrow company over there, has killed no more than fifty.
Seeing that was enough, Sam began to panic, and hurried to give the phone to Jiangshan, to seek help.
"We're starting to lose our front lines, and their guns are really too sharp! Many of us are the first to touch guns, and we can't beat them at all..."
Don't worry about it.
Eang's words made Sam shake.
All right? What's up?
Just as hesit, the ground shaking away from the earthquake, followed by an explosion from far away.
The shock wave from the pine trees, swept through the moss, even brushed over Liu Hai before his face.
Until Sam had a reaction to what was going on, he saw the smoke rising from the military base, and opened his mouth with astonishment.
Standing on a small hill on the other side of the battlefield, Jiangshan through the telescope to the bottom of the gorgeous smoke, the corner of the mouth did not attract any smile.
Looks like the Alpha's out of hand.
(Unfinished)
Chapter 1065 End of Arrow Company
Under pressure from the mortars, the chaos of the base was extraordinary, and no one had noticed that such a special force had entered the camp.
Without much effort, Kutpov placed a message on the pre-determined target, then took the small team out of the base, securely reached the departure point, and called for an air strike.
Shortly afterwards, Russian hidden bombers wandered over the clouds, dropping four torpedoes that accurately shot down two ammunition and two fuel tanks inside the base.
The blast swept through the camp and directly knocked down a circle of concrete.
The explosives and burning fires flew through the camp, causing a series of chain reactions, all around flames, all around blood and bodies.
The Guards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Medical personnel carrying loads were marching through the base, searching for casualties who lost their ability to act.
Workers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All the soldiers who were still moving were moving, looking for their own troops.
Sardes looked at the lights outside the window, and in his stubborn eyes was a gradual sign of despair.
The thick smoke covered the whole base, the light of the whole night sky dyed red, just like the end of the world.
"Shet..."
murmuring, he moved, like two legs, slowly out of the window.
He turned and the commander's staff were in sight.
What should we do, sir?
The remains of the explosion were quiet, there were no more explosives in the base, but the mood of all was not calm, and the mercenaries who escaped from the explosion were clear that the next was the beginning of their nightmare.
The previous explosion seemed to light up some signal, to sound the signal of the Sami attack.
With the blessing of the morning, Sam took the opportunity to pass a little, stood before all, shouted, with the rest of the violence.
More than six thousand people ran to the pine trees shining with fire.
Looking far, the scene was spectacular.
At the same time, looking at the smoke floating behind the base, all the mercenaries fighting on the front line fell into panic, the original high spirit fell to the bottom of the valley in a moment.
When faced with a flood of people, even if they had the strength to hold the line, they did not want to fight anymore.
There was no doubt, the line of the arrow company was broken, the resistance of the mercenaries in front of the Sami people's sea tactics.
Some fled back to the burning base, but most fled as soldiers, fled to the depth of the forest.
There's no need for the morning reminder, even the head pig should know what should be done at this time.
Looking at Sammy with the rebels begin to attack the military base, E morning took up the telescope in his hand, summoned from the storage space the pre-prepared越野摩托, gently hit Aisha's back.
Almost, let's go too.
"Well!"
Aisha pointed at him, and as soon as the river sat on the motor, a moving cross sat behind him.
The engine whispered and the tires scratched a piece of snow.
Jiang ran down the hills on his overseas motor, took Aisha to the side of the base, parked the motor on the side of the road, shivered the laser sword out of the storage space, took in his hand more than two strokes, without abrasion, cut off the wire-woven protective wall.
The whole base washed away by fire and confusion, and from time to time there were bursts of mortar, and all the mercenaries who could carry the guns were on the front line, fighting with the mob for control of the base gate.
Aside from one guard in front of the command, the whole rear has seen no one.
There's nothing like this to Jiangshan and to Aisha.
A total of ten guards stood on the guard tower, and the remaining eight guards stood at the entrance to the first and second floors, respectively.
Aysa took out the ghost sniper rifle, quietly settled the two guards standing on the guard tower, then used the dead angle of vision, to kill each of the eight downstairs.
As soon as Aisha had settled the guards outside the command, Eangshan took out his rifle and marched toward the main door, just as he passed through the door of the Hummer, but just as he crashed into Sardes, who had escaped from the command, and the command's officers.
To the upper view, both sides obviously froze.
The Chief of Staff first reacted, immediately extending his hand into his chest, but his hand had not touched his chest, and soon Aisha had blown his head.
Sardes was trying to resist, but was easily controlled by River morning, with his hands pressed on one side of the Hummer.
"Saldes, man, 43 years."
As General Manager and as Chief of Staff, am I right?
Though it was the first time they met, they stored his photographs and personal information in a full breath helmet linked to the Enterprise's database.
Just a face, about his information is projected on a full-screen.
His face was pressed on the top of the car, and the sadness of it was that he refused to surrender, he said, tearing his teeth.
"I won't say anything. you kill me..."
Did I kill you? I didn't ask anything.
Jiang, grinning, had no regard for his uncooperative attitude, took out a needle from his right hand, and unkindly stuck it to his shoulder.
"Well-"
His throat whispered, and Sardes stared with bloody eyes, but soon the glory of his eyes faded.
Jiang's hands were loose, and ordinary people who injected tobacco could resist, and there was no such precedent.
He turned his face, and asked the morning.
"Where is Carmen?
"In the laboratory of underground cover."
"Where is the underground?
"The entrance is in the center of the base and can only be entered through the stairs.
There are two stops next to the entrance.
As soon as Jiang had the information he wanted.
"Well, you can do it now.
Jiangshan took out a gun to his head, then dropped his body aside.
It's a rather painful death, but for the famous arrow company managing director, Mr. Sardes, to die in this silent form, may be more painful than death itself...
If the dead were to suffer.
"The underground."
Looking toward the center of the base, Jiang's mouth corner raised a cold laugh.
No matter what Carmen is trying to do, his good fortune should have come to the end.
The fate of the Rothschild family will be as they began, because of a war fame, because of a war death silently...
At this moment, however, a terrible thunder came from far away.
(Unfinished)
Chapter 1066.
The trembling swept through the battlefield, and even covered the explosion of the bullet.
In the midst of a fierce battle between the mercenaries and the mob, a dark shadow suddenly entered the battlefield.
With the light of the light bulb, all see the look of the monster.
Their legs, their arms, were painted black swords, and their long mouths were decorated with a pointed tooth the size of a grain of rice, and behind them were two pairs of short wings, like a mantis.
A brief stop for two seconds.
Everybody wasted by this scene.
However, at the moment of ceasefire, the mantis moved.
The bow's legs burst out, and the seven-foot-high body exploded like a gun.
Unable to respond to the most recent of the rebels, the wrong sword was cut off the head, and the artery sped back with blood.
Throwing the hunt down, the monster's shuttle-like mouth burst out of its neck, accompanied by a squeaking crunch, drinking almost to the hunt's bone marrow and blood.
The look of the boiled hair drinking blood is as cruel as the beast.
Even the blinded believers, at this time also the uncontrollable swelling of the stomach, the thighs began shaking backward.
"Ibris..."
It's the name of the devil, like Satan in the Bible.
"It's Iblis!"
I don't know who cried like this.
The crowded up their G36 rifles and shot dead with their triggers at the monster.
However, the mantis only raised the two blades of his hand, and let the bullet bite locally on the corneal armor, without the slightest sight of the 5.56mm bullet hit.
Most of all, the mantis monster, is not only one! There have been dozens of shadows on the ground, jumping from the entrance of the underground cover, waving their blades to the storm.
Once you're close, you're waiting for the fate of those who are violent.
Besides mantis, there is also a maggot-shaped, fat creature, which sprays highly corrosive saliva, even solid things like steel and cement are defeated by its strong corrosiveness, not to mention human flesh.
Faced with the myth of the devil, the believers finally began to fear.
As they came, Ben was the rebellion of the uals, and the people fell uncontrollably.
On the other side of the unbelieving mercenaries, they cheered.
It's you!
Even though it's a little creepy.
However, their cheering did not last long, and soon a similar nightmare came upon them.
Dense spores floated out of the underground cover and slowly spread throughout the camp, almost invisible in the darkness.
People who first touched these spores began to breathe difficulty, and then tearful pain began to spread from the chest cavity, and they cried and scratched their skins, letting the blood flow.
Soon, they lost their sense of the whole body, becoming close to the existence of a dead body.
Aside from those whose bodies were wrapped in mechanical outer bones, those who were on the battlefield, be they my enemies, were all swallowed up by the spores.
In order to survive, the mercenaries and the mob turned their guns towards each other and began to face the common enemy.
Nevertheless, from the beginning, they did not win.
Hold the grass, what is that thing?
As long as the claws of several categories of monsters, the cold sweat of the river springs a foot on his chest,
He threw away the shot, took out the laser sword, danced two swords, and cut off one arm.
Green blood washed out and burned swords vaporized into mist.
While the monster cried back, the morning did not follow, shaking with the right hand of the sword, a rotating blade separated from the sword, when the head split into the face of the monster, cut off its half face.
Fortunately, he didn't have a hand, otherwise he would have been beaten.
On the other side, Aisha raised a ghost sniper rifle, calmly exploded the shells of two mutants.
There are too many of them to stay here any longer.
Jiang picked up PK 2000 on the ground, replacing the jacket, "prepared to withdraw."
Aisha glanced, but did not move.
"When I come to interrupt-"
You go ahead, hurry!
Jiangshan grabbed Aisha's shoulder, pushed her behind, lifted a rifle and swept through several dead bodies who had stumbled toward him.
Yes, it's dead.
But it looks a little different from the ones he met in Cagayan, where they don't seem to be infected with viruses, but rather look a bit like the ones over there.
Warning: Unknown pathogens have been detected in the air and the filter has been opened automatically.
If necessary, please.
Looking at the two lines projected on the helmet screen, Jiangshan suddenly realized what these things are.
It's just too much.
The same thing he had in the sight of the sea.
In spite of all this, Jiang did not hesitate to use his supreme command in the Star circle trade, to circumvent all decision-making layers, to directly link the C-1 deployed in the synchronous orbit, to line up the base's underground covering entrances to strike targets, and to call for an air strike on the base.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, let's go before human issues!
"Here's a C-1, and the target has been confirmed.
Tungsten core is separate from synchronous orbit.
The air strike is expected to arrive ten minutes later.
Turn off the communications on the ears, Jiang ran out of the firing jacket of the rifle, immediately to the direction of the defense net.
Aisha, who had run out of the protective net, put on a sniper, and began to retreat back to cover the river.
I don't know how, these monsters seem to consciously follow them, as if they were being manipulated by some consciousness.
Before encircling a large army composed of the dead and the mutants, Jiangshan successfully drilled out the protective net, at the same time throwing a nuclear hand grenade, dragging Aisha head and running back.
After confirming that the dead and the aliens were not tracked out, Eangshan took the overseas motor out of the storage space, and drove with Aisha to the nearby mountain.
It's not in the direction of the camp, it's in the direction of the Russian border.
The motor raced up the hill, Jiang stopped the car, looked at the time on the watch, turned to the direction of the military base.
Using the light of zero, he could hardly recognize with the naked eye, that there were no more people in the entire military base.
It was at this time that white light of the stars appeared in the night sky.
With a narrow tail, dozens of tungsten balls gradually bombarded the center of the military base, the dust of the explosion burst ten meters high.
"It's supposed to be dead.
Jiang murmured, and touched the telescope from his pocket.
As the dust dissipated, the base left only a depth of tens of meters, like the depths of hell.
Moving creatures are crawling out of deep holes.

Chapter 1067
It was already six in the morning.
The orange civilian helicopter circled in the high air with the yle on the side.
At the moment when the black smoke of the ammunition storage rose, the Finnish broadcaster sent their helicopter to the scene the first time.
They thought there was a forest fire, but when they arrived, they found that it was not a forest fire, but that it was at the much-acclaimed arrow company military base in Finland, where a war seemed to have erupted, and even at the center of the event, there was a deep, unseen pit.
"Here is the Finnish broadcaster, which is now broadcasting to you about the forest fires in the suburb of Partak..."
Although it proved later that was not a big fire, but a man-made explosion?
Wait, what's that!
The camera adjusted focal length and amplified the camera in the direction of the military base.
Only in the burning base, a corpse wandered meat freely, and from time to time strange creatures climbed out of the pit.
We seem to have found something impossible.
Previously unseen experiments by the arrow company on military bases seemed to be true. What is this? Amorphous? Dead?
Just as helicopters were sending first-hand information to the people of Finland and the world, Jiangshan standing on the mountain was also worried about the situation inside the base.
It's clear that's where Carmen spent her time building the underground cover.
The Tungsten bullet from the sky was not able to completely destroy the underground cover, only to blow up the elevator into the underground cover.
Spores continue to spray out of the underground laboratory and have now spread out of the base.
Jiang noted that dreadful bacterium could not only cause the animal to mutate, but also infect the plants that are rooted there.
"Isa."
"Well?
Aisha turned her head toward the morning, her beautiful chest long hair waving in the wind.
"I think... we might have gotten into it," said Jiang, laughing, and dropped his telescope.
Aisha grinned doubtfully, and he did not understand the meaning of Jiang's words.
Jiang shook his head and did not explain to her.
Just then, a warning came to my mind, and Jiang and Aisha turned almost simultaneously, and pulled out their guns toward the junction.
Come out, I count to three.
Jiang said softly, his fingers brushed off the insurance.
With his hands above his head, a man dressed in a very glamorous fur stood up and spoke in a rather unstandardized Chinese.
Don't worry about yourself.
Looking at the scar and the wrinkles of the face, Jiang-shan took the pistol, relaxed his mouth, indicated that Aisha would also take the pistol, looked at him grinning.
"I fired at a little less.
"Thank you," said Kutpov, putting down his raised hands, and walking up to the bank of the river, he lifted his bar in the direction of the military base below the mountain.
"The special situation will not be explained for an hour and a half," he said.
Jiangshan.
All right, then, said Cutoff, pointing at the direction of the mountain, If you are not going to return to the camp, you can go with us to the point where there are helicopters waiting for us.
It is certainly impossible to return to the refugee camp.
Not only did he direct a riot in the homeland, but he also made a hole in the homeland's map and left a pile of rubbish.
I can't sit here if the Finnish government isn't nc.
With little hesitation, Eang returned to Russia with Aisha on the Alphate's "plane".
It seemed to confirm Yeung's guess that as he had just crossed the Finnish border, the Finnish Defence Force had already departed for Partak.
At a time when national security was faced with serious challenges, the Finnish authorities did not take any notice of the humanitarian crisis. tanks and armored cars entered the refugee camps, full-armed soldiers controlled the ammunition factories and warehouses without any hesitation, and handed over the weapons to the defeated generals.
There was no resistance from the Finnish Defence.
Or to say, without hesitation, Sam took off his weapon, stepped into the carriage, squatted in the corner, whispering in his heart the abominations of the old Ibris, and begged for the possession of the true God.
And those who had the chance to recover a life of the people, at this time most of the expressions are like him.
When asked what had happened last night, the most repeated words in the broken language were: "Ebrahim", "devil", "monster", "murder".
What made the commander cry was that the surrendering rebels seemed to be really frightened, and that it was almost impossible to get out of the dead place early in the carriage, with more than a thousand claiming to have been involved in the execution of the prisoners.
In fact, there were only ten commissioners executed that night.
"I've seen the devil!
It's amusing!
Throwing the brief on the table, Duvier looked at the map with a frowning, "How is the situation there at the military base?
"Our helicopters have been flying past, but nothing has been seen.
The entire military base was surrounded by a shit-yellow gas, and our pilots did not dare fly too close to fear that there might be toxic substances.
Let the scouts pass and let them remember to put on their protective clothing.
As soon as he had his word, an officer entered the tent of the Temporary Command and, after a military ceremony, handed over a letter to him.
"Command from the Department, sir."
After picking the eyebrows, Duvier opened the sealed letter.
As his eyebrows began to crease, he rubbed his bitter eyebrows and threw them aside.
"The mission has been canceled and the scouts have not been sent."
The deputy looked at the commander with astonishment and did not know what had changed his mind.
Responsibility, he reminded his boss, "If we don't confirm the situation inside the base, we can't make a war plan to begin the rescue.
"We don't need to plan, nor do we need help.
Thanks to the bureaucrats, the reporters are a step ahead of us, they have confirmed, there are no more people.
Duvier shook his head and pointed his fingers at the envelope, "This is an order from the Ministry of Defence not to approach the site within one kilometer.
Our only task now is to stay here, to cooperate with the police to evacuate the villagers of Partak, and to bring the refugees here back to the two camps on the Norwegian border.
Tied Tied, Duvy looked out of the tent, and cried low.
Let those bureaucrats go to Russia if they think they can solve all the problems.
Just as he complained, a special aircraft had taken off from Helsinki International Airport, carrying the Finnish Minister of Defence and the Vice-President, and flown to the largest city on the northern ice of Russia, Mormansk.
At the same time, the Russian Minister of Defence and the Secretary for Security rushed to the site, ready to seek a solution with Finland...

Only the circle trade can save you
The trouble of harmonious civilization is that their understanding of biology has exceeded the imagination of the human civilization that is in its infancy.
While the world is busy exporting morphology, they are already spreading more dangerous things-their evil genes.
Their DNA codes for living things, just like computer viruses.
Camen is dead, now that's not really worrying.
Even if he's still alive, there's only half a life left.
A harmonious civilization promised him the greatest benefit, which was nothing more than a few square kilometers, like what the Americans had promised to the Indians, that he would carry with him ten indigenous peoples to survive as a "model" of human civilization.
The only blessing of Jiang is that the forces of the Communist Party are now beginning to move down the slope.
If Cameroon were to be linked to harmonious civilization at the height of its power, half of Europe would now be a stranger.
But once again, if it hadn't been pushed to the bottom by the group of futures, if it hadn't been the gold apples that had been madly chased, how could Camen have been mad enough to go down this path?
Jiang did not believe that he did not see the danger of harmonious civilization, which almost wrote the gene of aggression in the cell nucleus.
Mormansk, the largest strategic town along Russia's Arctic, is less than 90 km from the Russian border.
Acknowledging the gravity of the problem, the Finnish Minister of Defence, while dispatching the defence force to the site of the blockade, immediately went to Russia with the Vice President.
The President of Finland had the intention to go personally, but the diplomatic procedure could not come up and he had to stabilize the situation in the country.
Since the event was very close to the Russian border, a bad even could cause the evacuation of the whole city of Mormansk, Russia also maintained the importance of the accident, Minister of Defence Sergey Shoigu and Secretary of Security Bart flying on a special plane from Moscow to Mormansk, where they met with high-ranking Finnish officials.
Besides high-level officials from the two countries, there were also special foreigners who participated in the meeting... or the war meeting.
Faced with the high officials of the two countries, Mr. Jiang gave a brief overview of the secret experiments conducted by the Rothschild family, collected by the Starring Trade, and repeatedly emphasized that this was an unauthorized military operation against the north of Finland, for the safety of Finland and the world.
Their rhetoric easily won the applause of Russian officials, after all, who were well-connected with Bart before the meeting began.
However, officials on the other side of Finland are not fools, the vice president and the ministers of defence are ridiculed.
Seeing that didn't work as expected, Jiang had stopped talking and started talking about the first focus of the meeting.
That's the danger of this X2 bacterium.
"In the center of the military base, the source of infection, which we call the mother's nest, is capable of producing a particular bacterium with spore characteristics.
"X2 bacteria," is how our scientists named it.
These bacteria are highly aggressive, and can easily infect organisms without antibodies, turning them into their own breeding greenhouses.
The infected organisms will show more aggressive and aggressive than before, and will modify their original DNA.
For example, with Spiderman, the Green Giant is probably a principle.
"That is, in a short time the citizens of the whole country will become Spider-Man," said the Finnish vice president, laughing coldly.
"The amount...
There's nothing to worry about for the time being, said Jiang, drawing a circle on the satellite map, pointing with a marker at the pine forest that was surrounded.
"Have you seen the dead pine trees? "The altered organisms...called altered species are impossible to leave the spore coverage.
Of course it doesn't exclude them from hunting or from spreading the activity of the spores.
There's one thing Jiang did not say, and that's what he's most worried about is the X2 mutation, or at least the X3 bacteria he doesn't smell.
After all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The only thing that can save you is star trading, which is something that needs to be done professionally," said the Russian security secretary, Mr Bart.
It's not yours to do this!
On hearing this, the Minister of Defence was suddenly angry, knocking on the table and drinking, "Now you say to us that only you can solve, and what do you give us to believe in you?
The Russian security secretary grinned, pinched his brow, and embarrassedly shifted his eyes.
Jiang, too, felt the nose a little embarrassingly, and coughed, "Well, it's definitely not me, it's Carmen who's causing the situation today.
What would happen today if you didn't bring in the arrow company and lease the northern wilderness to build the camps? Do you not even know that they are doing research on your land?
What are you going to do if I give it to you?
"Let's go to orbit," said Jiang without hesitation.
"Isn't your only two orbital flights in Ukraine?" the Finnish Minister of Defence questioned.
"In fact, we have a secret force, which has been training for a long time.
Jiang coughed softly.I didn't mean to be so early.I was out, but the situation is urgent, and now I can't take that much into consideration.
When he said this, Jiang also showed as if he had made a big concession.
The Finnish Vice President exchanged views with the Minister of Defence, then looked to the side of Yeangshan and Russian officials, and finally stopped at the face of the Russian Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoigu.
"I'm sorry, but your integrity is questionable.
We think NATO is better at solving the current problem, at least they will not say hello and shoot bombers into our airspace without a word.
If you're breaking the rules of the game, then don't blame us for making this difficult choice.
Finland’s NATO membership has been under discussion since the Cold War, but has remained unresolved.
Parliamentary elections have largely fixed the agenda for joining NATO, but the biggest obstacle is the final referendum, in which Finnish citizens are reluctant to give up their neutral status.
But if NATO solves Finland’s problems, then the most difficult referendums will not be overtaken by too much resistance.
Once Finland joins NATO will mean that Russia has more than a thousand kilometers of armed defense, not to mention that behind this line is Petersburg, a city of great strategic significance.
This is what Russia is most worried about, and in any case it is unwilling to see.
"Russia can't accept NATO troops into Finland, and you have a better choice."
Sergei Shaoui got up immediately and stressed, "If you stick to the wrong decision, things will get worse.
"This is a threat?" said the Finnish vice president, laughing coldly.
"It's a suggestion," said Bart in a soft tone.
"The people of Finland are facing life threats and what can be worse than now.
On behalf of the President, I thank you for your advice. In fact, our President had a meeting with the Secretary-General of NATO in Helsinki two hours ago.
Goodbye!
As high-ranking officials from this side of Finland stood up, and Sergei Shoigu tried to save them, but his face finally froze.
Remember to use burning bombs. To deal with those bugs, burning bombs may be more effective than adding bombs and pesticides.
"And if you're going to ask NATO to help you with this problem, remember that they mustn't use 5.6mm ammunition, that the cornea is naturally resistant to small-caliber ammunition, and that more soldiers have been sent to meat in the past," he said.
And if you can't solve it, remember to call me.
The Finnish Vice President, not knowing whether he had heard or not, left with the Minister of Defence and an official without turning his head.

CHAPTER 1069 The Beast
The conference room was quiet.
Only half of the scheduled, officials on the other side of Finland left the field in advance.
There was no sitting at the rise of Sergei Shoikov, who gave the secretary a look behind him, who would immediately go ahead and help his boss with the things on the table.
There was a sound of moving chairs and arranging documents, and the ministers began to prepare for withdrawal, and the officials on the Russian side left the long table.
Even half of the expected results have not been achieved and the meeting is over.
Jiangshan, standing in front of the satellite map, dropped the pen, and went to the door.
When he came, he took a man, and he had nothing to do.
When he left, he gave Aisha a phone call to help her prepare a dinner at the front.
He just wanted to have a hot dinner. The last time he had a hot dinner was twenty-four hours ago.
Yesterday waste all night outside, after Kutpov arrived in Mormansk by helicopter, the first thing he did was to call the Hilton to arrange a room, to go back to the hotel by express car, without even taking off his clothes, to fall asleep, until the afternoon the Russian Security Secretary Bart called him for a meeting.
It was now seven o'clock, and before the meeting began, he had taken only a tube of fruit-like nutritional supplements, at which point his belly had begun to protest.
Just as he was leaving the government building, Barter called for him, but he did not wait for the morning to go this way, and he went quickly to his right hand, and kissed his shoulder with a grin.
Have a meal? There's a nice restaurant nearby.
"I've already arranged dinner at the Hilton, or I'll be the guest.
Then Jiang gave Aisha another phone call to say to the front desk that the dinner had not been sent to the room, but had been eaten directly in the dining room, by the way, one more.
"Well," he said.
Seeing Jiang began to locate, Bart did not deny, took out the car key from the pocket, "seat my car?
"Please," said Jiang, laughing.
Unlike Defence Minister Sergei, perhaps because of his work, Bart didn't hire a driver, and traveled by himself.
This car is not called by Jiangshan, it is supposed to be a Russian car.
Take the seat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As soon as the car started, Bart's face fell.
"Dude, you've got us into a big trouble.
Jiangshan glanced at him, complaining.
"You're just like the Finns," he said, "and if something happens, you throw the trouble on my head.
If your Alpha team killed Carmen, there's not much trouble behind it!
I heard it was only 500 meters away, and you had every chance of killing him, but you're thinking about exploding what ammunition store?
Bart frowned.
"A man can play such a big role?"
"You can try to give him a decade of development, but he's never going to make the whole of Russia like that," said Jiang.
"What now?" asked Bart.
"Wait.
"Wait?
"They will naturally think of us when NATO is planted there."
Jiang laughed.
"You don't think NATO can solve this problem? It's just a few bugs.
Bart frowned.
In his opinion, without NATO's help, even with the Russian border troops, it would be easy to crush the bugs.
Eang laughed when he heard such a true speech.
It's just a bug?
Bart, holding the steer, paused for a while.
Just as he was about to go to sleep, he asked.
Why are you so sure? Don't get me wrong, I don't mean anything else.
I'm just surprised that you seem to know about this?T was the same time, and now it's the same X2 bacteria.
Perceptions from years of intelligence work told Bart that the two seem to have nothing to do with each other, but that there was a hidden link between them.
Jiang's squinted left eye opened a gap, unexpectedly looked more than Bart.
Just as he was preparing to make an excuse for laughing, he suddenly thought of the golden apples flowing from the factories controlled by Rothschild.
It was those golden apples that forced him to change his mind temporarily.
Maybe it's time now?
After thinking for a moment, Jiang suddenly laughed, and said.
"Yes, I really know about this stuff, and I know how Camen got this stuff, and you want to know why?"
"If it is convenient."
Even though the expression is not very careful, but Jiangshan can clearly feel, his tone is obviously quite careful look.
"Wait for a while we can talk about it.
Jiang did not answer, but rejoined eyes, returned to the state of keeping eyes on God.
It's half an hour from Hilton, and before he's gone, he has to think about what he's going to say.
There's a revolution going on in Germany, and there's no way to send soldiers to support allies.
American carriers are too far apart from the Mediterranean to the Baltic Sea seems too unrealistic, and will stimulate old hair's fragile nerves.
Finally, the United Kingdom, which has left the European Union, has not left NATO.
However, the British clearly underestimated the danger of the "mother's nest", and dispatched only a mechanized brigade, rapidly deployed through heavy transports to northern Finland.
Not knowing whether or not the Finnish government sent workers to cut down trees along the "infected area" and cut out a 50 meter wide boundary.
Immediately afterwards, the British Army fired twenty white phosphorus shots at the mother's nest, preparing for a physical sterilization before entering the infected area.
However, the resulted in surprise, after the explosion of the white phosphorus did blossom the brilliant flames, but soon the flames seemed to be "frozen" in the air, almost extinguished.
The spores, which were burned to charcoal, floated out of the ground shortly afterwards, filling up the lost portion.
Knowing that was not working, they extracted from the infected area a part of the spore suspension, and found that the single cell quickly consumes itself in the high temperature environment, secreting a special high temperature liquid, and extinguished the fire by wrapping the burner!
Self-contained cells!
This astonishing discovery has shocked many biologists who have been invited to test the spores of the infected area.
Even with their decades of experience, they don't know what this is all about.
This is not what was expected by Jiang.
Insects evolve.
Even a starship can do what a bandit thinks.
(Unfinished)
Chapter 1070 Let the professional come!
White phosphorus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Besides burning and burning bombs, the British also tried other things.
For example,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Unfortunately, the insects don't use their chemical weapons, they don't throw in any reactions.
In addition to this, the UK has considered placing more large-scale burning bombs, which would theoretically burn the air in the affected areas once and for all, but the Finnish government is not happy.
Bigger bursts, the more than fifty meters of isolation must be used, if it caused a forest fire, the losses would be terrible!
Here's the Arctic, the primitive pine trees! Every tree is a living fossil!
The trees that were cut down to put out the bombs were enough to make Finland feel sick.
Moreover, the British could not guarantee that the larger burning bomb would not be "frozen" by the strange spore.
It's awful, but even misted gasoline can cover a layer!
Let's not let's not let's just show our future brothers some muscle and make them feel more comfortable joining the big family of NATO.
The British Defence made a decision, and the dispatched commander did not matter, dispatched two mechanized regiments, a total of forty "Ajax" infantry vehicles, and more than three hundred infantry in defence uniforms followed.
Their plan was to remove all species from the infected area within 10 minutes, to seal the entrance within 20 minutes, and to send special troops down to the underground bunkers to clear out the sources of infection.
Soldiers dressed in protective clothing did not realize the danger of the mission, but in the face of interviewed media reporters, said that if the mother nest appeared in London, there was no use for them to go, the firefighters could not solve them.
Their appearance has attracted worldwide attention, and this interview is of course also broadcast worldwide.
Similarly, in the conference room yesterday, the satellite map on the large screen has been converted into a Russian television reporter's live interview with the British soldiers who are about to undertake a mission in the Partakh region.
Jiang did not want to go with the old boys to see the news, because he had roughly guessed what would be the end.
But Secretary of Defense Sergei Shoigu himself invited, and it was not good not to give him a face, so came a visit.
To tell the truth, a bunch of big guys sitting there staring at the news, it feels really strange.
Are you sure they can't deal with it?
"I don't mean good luck, but it's important for Russia's defence strategy," said Sergei, looking at the morning.
If the British succeed, we will have more than a thousand kilometers of defense.
"Wait."
leaning on a chair, Jiang looked at the self-confident British soldier on the screen, and left his mouth.
London Fireman?
It's not worth it's not worth it's not worth it's not worth it's not worth it
As the army set off, the television screen moved, the reporter came to the 40 armored cars on the way, a side special, and then quickly the screen from the ground to the air.
The helicopter followed the mechanical force far away, sending them into the infected area covered by a cloud of spores.
With confidence in theft, the British commander, with the permission of the Ministry of Defence, opened up to reporters some of the insensitive combat communications to show the NATO group's fighting power.
As for combat video, due to the involvement of military secrets, will not be made public.
"There are 12 that have reached the target area, for the time being, no abnormalities have been found."
"The Species".
Turn on the insurance and fire free.
The intense gunfire and the strange roar last for two minutes.
The faces of all Russian officials sitting in front of the screen, especially the Russian Minister of Defense.
They were all seniors in the army, and it was only when they heard the voice that they knew that the situation in the British army was not, I am afraid, very optimistic.
We're fighting aliens! There are too many of them, but our firepower is better than one-"
Shet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The communications were severed, and it was clear that the British commander was aware that the following was no longer suitable for the media.
The only thing that could depict the war in the sitting room was the flickering lights on the screen in the muddy fog.
There was noise in the conference room, the Russian military face to face.
No one expected such a result No one thought that a mechanical force would defeat a group of mutants...
Only one.
That's Jiang.
If they were a bunch of insects and ignored their anti-armored capabilities, he would not be surprised that the British would lose their hands.
His only curiosity now was how many of these armored cars could be pulled out intact.
As for the infantry, I'm afraid even the bones have been eaten.
"There's been a little accident in the cleaning of the mother nest.
Here's a briefing for you.
On the screen, the reporter expressed a little embarrasment.
I don't even have a screen.
At this moment, Jiang's watch vibrated down.
"I'll go out and make a phone call.
Jiang rose early and walked out of the meeting.
The phone is from the Finnish Presidency.
Don't ask him why. It's not like guessing.
Arrived outside the meeting, Eang Morning walked to the window of the corridor, opened the full screen, and pressed the connect key.
There was no immediate opening of the telephone.
The silence lasted for two seconds, and the atmosphere was a little bit embarrassing, but at the end of it it was a shame to open the mouth.
Well, the British don't.
As expected, the regular army is not a mercenary, every life of the peace period is very expensive.
There was an unknown breach of a camp in the infected area, not even the entrance of the underground covering, for fear of a riot within the United Kingdom.
"Oh.
"The Americans said they would observe for a while, but the coverage of the spores is expanding, and they are now covering the 50m width of the barrier," he said.
Hearing the President of Finland, Jiang's face appeared.
The British soldiers killed were equivalent to providing the mother's nest with easy to absorb organics, including the bodies of animals including humans, and were more likely than wood and insects to serve as the breeding ground for spores.
This swallowed up about a battalion of soldiers, and the mother nest began to expand the coverage of spores without waiting.
From this point of view, the nest really has a carmen style.
Their guesses were tested, how much of Jiang's confidence in solving the problem.
But at this time he did not hurry to open, obviously in the face with the kiss of the job, it would be so quick to loosen the mouth, it would be too cheap for them!
I'm going to help you out of this trouble, you're not happy, now ask? What did you do earlier?
"Well.
Adjust the tone, said Jiang softly. "Whatever you say, say it straight.
"That... wouldn't you?" asked the Finnish President in a soft tone.
After a moment of hesitation, Jiang began to speak slowly.
"Now the area of the infected area has been expanded a lot, not even the mechanical travel of the UK, I'm afraid, some difficult to do.
Would you rather try carpet bombing? Although the spores can prevent burning, there's no reason to carry even a high bomb.
"We tried earlier, but it didn't work.
The spores that is removed are not at the speed of their secretion, but instead blow the spores farther away.
The President of Finland laughed bitterly, "Well, we're not going around. You're a businessman.
With a smile in the corner of his mouth, Jiang opened with a smile.
The President of Finland jumped when he heard the figure.
Can I get something cheaper?
The new dollar is not low, and the euro has recently depreciated, unless he throws in the Finnish Defense Forces’ annual procurement budget, which is clearly impossible.
"If you can't pay, we can also consider another way of paying.
For example, to sell to us the arrow company's assets in Finland.
Of course, when this happens, we're only likely to make a $300 million valuation of their assets.
Believe me, this is already a very conscientious price, absolutely much higher than the bank's valuation.
Saying this, Jiang smiled evilly in his heart.
The Company, though it was his old rival, had no enmity with the mercenaries who worked for the money.
After this incident, the arrow company is likely to go bankrupt due to the high fines issued by the Finnish government.
If an arrow company registered in Finland, more than 20,000 experienced veterans, would be a tiny fortune for the star circle trade.
As long as they are brought into the training camp and they are given proper benefits, they will soon sell their lives to his new boss.
Management is not relieved to dissolve all, to screen all of the basic soldiers and to pack all the weapons and equipment to sell to Africa.
As for the remaining two camps, this can be reserved for a while, as long as the means are appropriate, and can be used as a bargaining chip with the EU.
As for the two military bases that support the refugee camps, he also has great use.
The President of Finland.
"The deal."
Jiang smiled.
It's nice to work together.
"When will your people be there? If it's ten days and a half months, I'm afraid we won't be able to wait..."
It won't take long, Jiang looked at the time on the full screen, give me five hours.
By the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chapter 1071
Tens of meters in diameter is like a crater, sitting in the center of the military base.
Below this crater, about 500 meters deep, is the underground cover designed by the Rothschild Group for experimental purposes.
At this moment, this underground cover, has no breath of life, completely covered by a suspicious red meat bubble, spreading a fascinating odor.
If you look closer and closer, you will see that the surface of the bubble is filled with bubbles of the size of grass.
Each time the abscess breaks, a spore gas is released from it.
With the efforts of thousands of meat bubbles, innumerable spores are born at every moment, and along the entrance float to the surface, expanding the area of the mother's nest with brick tiles.
The center of the underground laboratory, like a meat mountain, stirs fat meat bubbles.
Being the core of the nest, it is both the heart of the nest and the "central processor" of the nest.
And that way of spreading from the top of its foot is like connecting the master and the submachine data line.
In its abdomen, a carved coffin of resin material, or "cultivation chamber".
Unlike the meat red nest, this painted black cage looks very hard.
It was rare to see a man lying in that half-transparent layer of palms.
He opened his eyes and his eyes stayed on the line of half-circle.
[ ]
Of these, 4,000 were new refugees who had been taken underground, and more than 3,000 were researchers from the Guards Brigade and the Underground Institute, and more than 7,000 were mainly mercenaries and mobs fighting in the base.
Each person can contribute two units of organic material, he has consumed half of the organic material used to strengthen the mother nest and hatch the alien species.
It's not enough.
Camen, who was lying in the groove, shook his head and began to reflect on whether he had gone too far.
If it weren't so crude as to destroy them once, it was impossible to get those Britons to create the illusion that they would win if they didn't, and to send more people into the pit, to give him more organics, to enlarge his power.
Now, however, the British seem to be more cautious.
In addition to continuing bombardment of the area, no more people were sent in.
Upgrading to a secondary nest requires 500,000 units of organic material.
There are two sources of organic matter, one of the most primitive for photo-cooperation, which can grow slowly only after waiting.
Another is the quickest, and the simplest, crude way, which is to eat constantly.
To digest their flesh and bodies, to enlarge themselves.
Carmen, of course, prefers the latter.
If light cooperates to obtain organic matter from the soil and the air, the area of the mother nest extends to the whole world, it will only be a few centuries later.
But if he depends on continuous swallowing, he can accomplish in just a few days the transformation that can be accomplished in centuries.
With this in mind, there was no resentment on Camen's face.
He chose this place as his home because the camp near the military base has a population of close to half a million.
If he swallowed up the refugee camp and ate up the nearby town of Partak, he would have already completed the first stage of evolution!
Their second-class nests will have more terrifying energy, not only will their range expand to a hundred kilometers, but they will also unlock new "military" species.
For example, a monster called Meat Mountain, which is said to carry only the fat of the tank can be fired.
However, due to the early morning of the half way killed, all of his plans failed.
Thinking about this, his teeth were tight together, and he cried.
Spores are his eyes and ears, he can clearly sense what is happening in the area covered by spores.
He was sure that night. He saw Jiang-in the military base, but it was a pity that he could not leave.
It is suggested that the host is still far from the organic reserves, and that it should be upgraded before the transition.
A thought came to his mind, a suggestion from his mother's nest.
There are no obstacles to the ability to speak and to communicate directly with consciousness, which makes Carmen feel more comfortable than ever.
This is one of the reasons for his greatness in biological civilization through the golden apple.
[Are you upgrading the army?] [You are right, too.] [Carman] replied, closing his eyes, and connecting consciousness with the control center of the mother nest.
A row of simplified upgrades now appear before him, and after careful screening, he distributes 5,000 points of organics to the reinforced Wings of the Swordsman.
The Swordsman is a name taken from the man who looks like a man.
Reinforced Swordsman, the back wings will be longer and stronger, not only as ancillary to reinforced jumping power, but as the true wings that can fly short distances.
As Carmen distributed the organs, a mass of unknown magma flowed down the pipe to the pile of eggs in front of the mother nest, under the input of the organs, the eggs began to mutate, together with the new "sword fighters" who were about to break cocoon out of the eggs.
Their eggs were thermal beds for hatching aliens, which for him were as common as the "camps," and at this time the ceiling was shivering.
He lifted his eyes slightly, and Camen's mouth caught a cold laugh.
The soil above the shelter has been reinforced, and the roots of the fiber material have been woven into the soil into a layer of up to 500 meters thick "anti-ballistic clothing", capable of exploding and of resisting earthquakes as much as reinforced concrete.
The British commander said he had thrown hundreds of shots on his head, and he had blown up a layer of cement.
Heaven's weapons can blow out the entrance just because the mother nest has just been formed, he has not yet come to reinforce the entrance...
Suddenly, his face changed sharply, and at the same time, the consciousness of the mother's nest was also present in his mind.
[Warning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Damn! It's the star circle trade!
Camen scolded, and seemed to have underestimated the power of the star circle trade.
Initially he thought a few tungsten balls were the most likely to rub off a layer of protective skin outside the mother's nest, now it seems to be no longer a layer of skin.
Damage to the protective layer already needs to be repaired with organic material, not much for him, it is enough to get to the bones!
The quantity of the organic wasted at the speed of the visible, and as Camen hastily adjusted the organic to fill the gap, a string of decayed cracks came from above him.
Aware of what had occurred, Camen's face suddenly turned, and his facial muscles became very twisted.
"Fak!"
(Unfinished)
Chapter 1072
More than forty armored cars rushed into the infected area, when everyone thought it would be a one-sided British army show, but the course of events changed dramatically in just a minute.
No one knows how intense the fires in the infected areas, but almost the whole world saw the result of the fires.
Only five of the forty armored cars returned, and all the infantry were there.
The shotgun wasted on a group of insects, and the commander of the battle, Colonel Moston, could not accept such a conclusion.
Not only is he unable to accept such a reality, with his cell phone surrounded by the cucumber masses.
From Kagan to Tokyo, the word bio-crisis once again hits the nerves of the world's people.
Originally thought to only appear in literature and film, now has been brought into reality, very light and easy to attract enough attention globally.
and panic.
Discussions about X2 bacteria have been raging on social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and around the neck.
"The last one was a T virus, this one was an X2 bacterium?
Is it good for them to study? State should legislate to prohibit these dangerous studies!
"It's hard to believe that was actually the British. Are the British armoured cars all paper?
They're just a bunch of strangers! Can't their teeth bite their armor?
"Last Day Survival Manual," "Last Day Burns" ""How to Survive in the Last Day," ""Limited in Quantity," ""Want to Buy Fast."
Send out the peace force, it's not a national problem, it's a world problem...
"I am very surprised now that every arrow company military base has such an institute?
"No," he said.
What's happening on the social platform, Colonel Moston, is temporarily invisible.
He is now worried about how to explain the disastrous defeat with the Ministry of Defence and Parliament.
A whole mechanized camp is so unwilling to fall into it!
God, the Prime Minister also hopes that he will smooth the matter and bring Finland into the big family of NATO.
And now, his face was pale, and he had not even the courage to draw up a plan of action, nor to say anything, nor to send any more troops.
Don't say a brigade mechanized force, a division filled in is not enough!
The Finnish government is in a hurry, half threatening, that if they can't deal with the mother's nest, they should contact the Star Trade to find a solution.
According to the Finnish government, Moston sniffed, because it was not a question of combat.
Even armoured cars can melt into holes. Isn't the mechanical outer skeleton of the Star circle harder than armoured cars?
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
As soon as he could find a way to kill those spores, the aliens themselves would be extinct.
"I admit that we underestimated the power of the mother nest and that it was the wrong choice to send troops into the infected areas,"
"Scientists from London have been studying the DNA structure of these spores and believe that in a short time they will be able to design a way to exterminate the X2 bacteria," Mr. Moston told the media.
"Does this mean that Britain will give up its military aid to Finland," the reporter asked.
NATO will never give up any friendly partner, but this is no longer a matter for the UK.
"God.
Come on! What's that!
Just as Colonel Moston was busy explaining to the media, a scream came from the crowd around him.
There was only one female reporter, who looked at the sky, with her fingers pointing to the infected area.
A "fire" came down from the sky.
Even a few kilometers away, you can still hear the sound of the blast through the sound barrier.
Originally shot at Colonel Moston, turned to the empty area.
Almost at the same time, the earth shaking from the bottom of everyone, shaking everyone's eyeballs, while shaking everyone's heart.
It's not surprising that's the first time the star circle trade's base weapon appeared in front of a media reporter.
Muston was glad the media moved the camera, he was clear, his face at this moment must be wonderful.
()
Farther than a hundred kilometers from Mormansk, in the Hilton presidential suite, Earl Morning was sitting on the sofa, overlooking through a full-screen, remotely commanding the star circle trade against the aliens.
Thermal Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb
"What?
Didn't fall?
Looking at the full-screen, Jiang Zhong sounded strangely.
Logically, even if the underground cover is more than 500 meters, it is not possible to stop the tungsten core bomb.
This is a tungsten ball falling from a synchronous orbit. Even if the 500 meters are made of reinforced concrete, it's going to turn into cement dust.
It's ancient nest.
Jiang's eyes moved slightly and gave orders to Ivan.
"Let me go!
No No No No No No No No No No No!
B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B
Their ability to recover is strong, and normal wounds can only be healed with a few breaths of spore air, visible to the naked eye.
Although the British did several rounds of bombing on military bases, they did not actually kill any of the different species.
Arms and legs may be fatal for humans, but for this group of organisms, it is something that can be recovered by lying in the mother's nest for a while.
Even if they were blown up on the spot, if they were dragged back, they would soon recover into organics and re-incubate into a new species.
Moreover, most aliens hide underground.
Jiang's warning plan is simple, too rough, it's tired tactics, with the heavenly weapons to the death!
As long as you can defence, one punch will not die another punch, until the mother's exposed body!
The tungsten core was not initially aimed at the aliens, but at destroying the underground cover.
All of the attacks are concentrated in a circle of ten meters in diameter, and although the recovery of the mother nest is as strong as the aliens, the star circle trade's basic weapons are not enough. As for the vertical penetration of weapons, no country on this planet can catch up with them!
Jiang didn't know that simple and brutal plan made Camen hide from the ground.
Round 1 Round 2
A round of tungsten balls fell from the synchronous orbit, Jin burned money, Camen burned organics.
Both were emotionally drained, but apparently the limited Carmen was more heartache.
Soon,the mother's nest couldn't stand.
To ask how to know, from the satellite image can be seen.
As the dust washed away, the soil was completely decayed and exposed to the roots of the mixed disc underground.
Undoubtedly, these strong roots are the reason for the strong underground cover, under which the soil acts as a concrete defense.
Their nest wastelessly releasing spore gases, trying to cover up its weakness, but Jiangshan did not miss the opportunity, ordering Iwan to win the chase.
The strike from the synchronous orbit continued to fall, and when the electron C-1 was deployed in the synchronous orbit, it dropped the last tungsten core bullet, covering the claws above the underground cover.
Defending a completely collapsed mother nest, burning. exposed meat bubbles hidden in underground cover.
Seeing this scene, Jiang-knowing the opportunity came, immediately order to Ivan.
"Mother's nest is full. " "Low body, stop the orbit weapon attack. "
Send me a command, 3 th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th th
"Yes!"
Ivan answered with force.
It's like a waterfall. It's been fifteen minutes since it started.
The journalists, the soldiers, the townmen, who stood by the town of Partak, were still standing there, looking up at the clear sky at 45 degrees.
Colonel Moston opened his mouth and couldn't say a word.
Standing next to him, the Finnish Minister of Defence was gray faced, regretting that he knew he had to ask for the rings to be settled at the outset.
As for those reporters, at this moment in their minds, they have begun to calculate what kind of rhetoric should be used to accompany the "air strike" on the destroyed land.
Not everyone wasted their time in surprise.
Just when everyone thought everything was over, a line of fire fell from the sky to the ground...
(Unfinished)
Chapter 1073
For those who were standing in front of the town of Partak, it was only a glance that the sound of steel colliding with the earth came from a few kilometers away.
The Leader of Finnish Broadcasting gave a glance to the reporters, and shortly after broadcast the helicopter took off again, heading towards the military base.
Not only were media journalists interested in orbital flights, but the British and Finnish military also sent two helicopters.
It's supposed to help the circle trade when it's needed, but it's not really what it's for.
Through satellite imagery, the little movements of Finland and the UK were seen in the eyes, but not in the mind.
Since he took out the power armor, he had no intention of continuing to keep it secret.
This unit of only two hundred "micro" brigades, he started two years ago.
The reason he's been covering up to now, on the one hand, is because there is no fighting power around the night, really not worth it to bring out the power armor to show muscles, rather than hiding to make the bottom card.
On the other hand, there is concern that the regional arms race will affect his economic development.
The only reason for this is that the two concerns mentioned above have disappeared.
As for why, wait until the end of the war.
As the fifty aircraft dropped, the dust of the explosion had not gone away, and two hundred full-armed T3s with tactical rifles rushed out of the open aircraft, stepped into this sporadic battlefield, and surrounded by the cut-offs of the sky-based weapons.
Feeling the intrusion of the fast, the terrible whirl from the deep pit.
A single Swordsman, shaking behind his wings, jumped out of the deep.
When the artillery came, these aliens were hiding underground, and now they felt the breath of life, and they could not resist the lust for blood.
Their intentions, however, were destined to fail, and this time they met their opponents, and the previous group of weak chickens were no more than a level.
"Shout!"
With a sharp roar, a swordsman moved.
The bow's legs burst, the long wings that were reinforced behind burst for a moment, and the two saw-beared blades became scissors, and sharply cut to the nearest power armor.
If it were cut to the ground, the iron would have to be torn out with a mouth!
Late, soon, a transparent shield was extended from the left arm of the power armored.
The Swordsman hit the whole man on the shield, not to shake the power armor half, but to lay down the two edges of the horn material.
The long mouths of the shut up and cried sharply.
The Swordsman retreated with his arms to his head, but hadn't retreated two paces before the power armor struck his defense with a shield and then held his right hand to the battle.
The Magic Dagger stabbed into his chest, and then, by force, to the next tear, even his intestine was cut in half.
The confrontation occurred in a moment.
Camen, lying in his bedroom, stared at me.
He'd never seen such a twist, which reminded him of the long-held tale of the Ironman of Colo.
In fact, as early as the Los Angeles attacks, there was a rumor that a "steel warrior" had been created about the Star circle trade.
More unreliable rumors say that in fact Jiangshan himself appeared in Colo city "Steelman", his own image and the successor of a Stack industry really is too.
Thinking about this, cold sweat came spontaneously out of Carmen's face.
Though he did not laugh at the rumors, he did not think that Jiang had not only got himself such a "steel wardrobe" but also armed an army with that priceless thing at a glance!
Shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock shock
This team is not very large, it is thought to be the king of the circle trade, and the king of the circle is sure to be limited in number! As long as he survives the early development, the whole forest will be incorporated into his mother's nest consciousness.
In order to deal with stars, it is to fill with insects, and he has to leave this card here!
Even at a cost.
Around the heart, Carman bite teeth, consciousness to the mother nest consciousness.
Nearly at the same time, red blood vessels in the mother's nest seemed to surge, the meat bubbles sleeping under the shadows burst, a bubble the size of a sesame bubble burst to the size of a green bean, then exploded, releasing spores containing rabid factors.
All the ink green eyes were in one instant printed red.
"Shout!"
The roaring washed away, and one of the sword fighters fell into a frenzy, and threw himself overhead against the two hundred armed men.
But they didn't get close, and they hit the fire net that was coming.
In the hands of Jiangshan, this batch was shipped to the modern T3 type of power armor to adapt to the modern battlefield, the most obvious distinction is that the right arm is no longer a clear turning machine gun, but according to the battlefield needs to design such as grenade launcher, extended protective shield, plasma cut dagger and so on mountable accessories.
Standing on one knee in front of the tall shield, the right arm secretly emits a dark blue arc.
In front of the rear armored step, up the right arm triangular gun tube, pouring out the fierce fire.
Behind them were 72 mm anti-load guns, two-legged ground-anchored power armor, and a variety of high-explosion tear-offs.
In terms of firepower alone, this two-hundred-strong armored brigade has more than doubled the mechanized force of the near-thousand British.
Taking into account combined combat capabilities such as mobility and defence, Mr. Jiang said without exaggerating that there was no problem with the two hundred hanging onto about one infantry division without either side using air strikes or other field support.
Fighters in the front line were torn to pieces by the fireworks, and those nearby were cut into two pieces by the iron-cut dagger struck from behind the shield.
Cork protects against bullets, but is vulnerable to thermal ion radiation like tofu.
Green blood splashed on the battlefield, including the acid of the sprayer.
Carmen's heart to the end of the circle trade dead bar, will never here shrink half, now has the mother's incubation and digestive capacity to the limit!
At the end of his life, he wasted no money, and all the organics were taken out, transformed into sword fighters and blowers, and pushed to the front.
The only advantage of the insects is that they are not afraid of death, and that, under the interference of the will of the mother nest, even if they fight to the last alien, they will be unwilling to shoot at their guns.
With thermalization of the battle, soon the distance between the two sides was reduced to the extreme, from the one-sided fire suppression to the close proximity of the short soldiers.
Dynamic armor strong but not enemy, and the mixture gradually began to appear injured, see, Camen's face appeared a gleam, according to this trend, the first unsupportable must be the star circle trade!
Thinking about this, he pressed all the organics.
At this moment, however, Camen's mood dropped from the top to the bottom of the valley, and his enthusiastic face gradually faded into despair.
Through the eyes of a swordsman, he saw a string of lights flickering in the air.
The second round of star circle trading has begun.
This is not a man, but a drone.
Before the launch, the dynamic armored vehicles engaged with the aliens maintained the position of firing, and retreated in order, leaving enough field space for the aliens climbing from the deep pit.
As they approached the corner of the military base, a drone beehive crashed into the back of a strange army.
Thousands of drones flocked out, and a swarm of drones flocked to the wounds of their mothers' nests, which had been bombarded with sky-based weapons.
When Carmen came back, everything was too late.
Underground aliens were essentially sent to the ground, where only the aliens who had just climbed from the eggs remained under the cover.
Although the number is still impressive, it is not enough to stop the drones from floating like water.
Without fighting aliens, these drones didn't even fire a single shot, attacking aliens inadvertently to the ever-breaking insect egg.
Camen's face turned green.
"Fak!"
A hundred kilometers away in the morning of the river, he sat up from the sofa, his fist beat on the tea.
Come on!
(Unfinished)
CHAPTER 1074.
The drone that was aiming at the eggs suddenly exploded, a row of floating eggs caged in a light, instantly blown to pieces.
Red and ink-green plasma melted together, splashed out of the broken meat bubble, and burned together with the meat at high temperature.
Some of this blood belongs to the mother and some to the unformed foreign embryos.
Camen was lying in the cabin, cool from the top to the heart of the foot...
If he could still feel cold.
There was a sense of defeat in his mind.
It feels like the right high of the bomber, but it's the opposite A bomber of the barracks.
[Warning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Their consciousness washed away in his mind, and Camen was busy looking at the organic store.
Nevertheless, when he saw the hundreds of stabs, his face suddenly faded from the last trace of blood.
Just now, he had all the resources allocated to the insect eggs to hatch the swordsman.
However, as the drones flew into the suicide attack, his organs were damaged to the most.
It is not impossible to digest the residues on the ground, but to convert them into organics takes time, which depends on the existence of carbon and the efficiency of photosynthesis of spores.
Cannon doesn't know exactly how long it will take, but a few hours is sure.
But will Star Trade give him this time?
The speed of the bombers stopped, and the strange attacks did not have any effect.
Standing at the corner of the base, the dynamic armored brigade, under the command of the commanding department, began to counter the declining aliens!
On this side, theraptor was torn to pieces by the fireworks, and on this side, the swordsman was cut open by an ion cutting dagger, splashed with corrosive ink and green blood, and even washed off the coatings on the power armor.
Thousands of different species look at many, but in the absence of supplements, destroyed is only a matter of time.
The collision between blood and steel, the first confrontation between harmonious civilization and pure civilization, with the dust of nitrous dispersion settled.
Dust washed away and no more aliens climbed out of the pit.
The front row, a single knee-powered armor picked up the expanded shield, one hand held up to the ground, and slowly stood up from the ground.
"It's over," said Shet.
"It's all done. "
Another warrior threw away his clay arm, and answered in a loud voice.
When the battle was over, no one lifted the mask.
High-density spores still float outside, and are dangerous even for those who have been given gene drugs.
There were those who stood on the ground waiting for orders, and there were those who simply sat on the ground and did not care whether the bodies of the aliens were malicious.
There was no cheer, only the rest of the loot.
A total of 40 T3s were scrapped on the battlefield, and more than thirty people were killed on the scene. For the new dynamic armored brigade, this loss was undoubtedly heavy, but for the result of the battle, it was undoubtedly historical.
Nearly 10,000 species have died under their fire.
Undoubtedly, even if one of NATO's divisions were thrown in, they would probably not have achieved such a large victory, nor would they have fought more and more enemies.
When he got to the front of the team, the chief of the armored brigade looked around at his brothers.
"Okay, gentlemen, the task is not finished, let's go down and finish the bug thoroughly.
Let me see.
He pointed down the touch pad on his arm, and controlled a reconnaissance drone to fly down the deep pit.
Before the drone was attacked by aliens, he saw clearly the following, then said, "Around thirty.
Who else has the courage to go with me?
A soldier with a rifle stood up from the ground and raised his hand.
Come on, I can still move.
count me one.
The Brigadier picked up ten men from the team, took the small team to the depths, opened the back of the turbine and jumped down.
The twelve power armor landed, and the swordsman who was sleeping in the darkness immediately jumped up, ready to fight to the death.
The traveller, as usual, lifted his arms, lightly depicted the strange neck, and with another hand took out the pistol and pressed down the trigger at the door of his head, and threw the paralyzed body aside.
The remaining dozens of aliens were separated from each other, and the soldiers behind were shot into the screen.
Passing the strange body forward, the soldier in the power armor came to the core of the mother nest.
Here they saw a disgraceful insect egg that had been blown up, and a mixture of ink green and red.
It's awful, Shet.
finish finish finish finish finish finish.
The workers took off the explosives from behind and distributed several aluminum heaters to the soldiers.
Spores can extinguish fire, but the mother does not have this function, as long as a part of the burning is inserted into the mother's core, it can effectively defuse the burning from the spore gas.
Looking at all the soldiers who traded the stars, there was a panic on Camen's face.
When an aluminum heater was nailed to his mother's nest, he cried red with his eyes.
"No-"
The soldier who was closer looked at Camen, grinned at the mask, and with his hand the aluminum heater shook Camen, then slammed into the core of the mother nest.
Bright light leaks from the gap, but much more is sprayed on the inside, and under super-hot burning, the core of the mother nest is dissolved at visible speed.
Looking openly at this scene, Carman's heart was dripping.
For this mother, he sacrificed the whole research institute, loyal to his guard, even his heart.
But now, the circle trademen in his face, will destroy all.
Resentment,,,,,,
His face was indescribable.
Just then, the brigadier came to his side, and, with his fingers, knocked on the resin cage, indicating that Camen was looking this way.
Then he took out his future cell phone from his waist and flattened it onto a film in the cabin.
We met again.
Sitting in his presidential suite at Hilton, Eang-looking at Camen lying in the training room, smiled, "I didn't think of it this way, it's really ironic.
Im staring deadly at the screen of the cell phone, Carmen's eyes are full of blood, are you looking at my jokes?
"Yes, I don't."
Jiang shaking his head, looking at the grim of Camen in the cabin, from his body has not seen any old aristocracy of grace and kindness, the tone has not brought a bit of pity, "I'm just curious, what is it that made my opponent look like this.
Carmen did not answer, and at this moment his brain was dominated by hatred.
Just then, Jiang noticed the black circle on his head.
"A gold apple?"
With his eyes slightly wrinkled, he rarely recalled what had happened in the history of the Rothschild family, whose people seemed to have been predisposed to the effects of the Crane particle wave,
Without the help of the external contact can be fuzzy sense, which is afraid the field does not have the ability.
The universe is filled with a multitude of uncluttered crayon waves, like electromagnetic waves.
And this guy, not only belongs to the kind of people who are prone to crayons, but also has a kind of prejudice to the golden apple, and even sleep puts the crayon wave amplifier on the bedside.
It's like you put a magnet on a TV, and it's not long before the TV starts to fade color.
Quite frankly,he's crazy.
After analyzing this, Jiang had a sudden apprehension, and was not interested in what he had said to Carmen at this moment.
With a sigh, Jiang shut down the communication window with Camen and ordered the chief of the brigade.
Give him a break.
"Yes."
The Black Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca
Bang!
His consciousness fell into the abys when the gun sounded and there was not a chance to speak.

CHAPTER 1075 The Concern of the Pentagon
It was not only the British and the Finns who were watching the battle, but also the Americans who were closely watching what was happening in Finland.
Everybody washed their faces when the Star Trade Festival released this weapon.
Then came the later Dynamic Armoured Brigade, U.S. drone flying tactics, and the atmosphere of the Fifth Corner Conference Room even cooled down.
Although the British were not clear, they still felt the kind of fear that flooded like tides, and how strong the power armor that surrounded the kind of attack was.
If you compare the K1 outer skeleton to a bicycle, the power armor is undoubtedly the existence of a motorcycle.
Not only does it provide the soldiers with high mobility armor, but it also serves as a source of fire power, raising the soldier's individual combat power to the limit.
Despite his position as a man, the most unlikely thing to be seen by the U.S. Department of Defense at this moment is that the circle trade has finally conquered the species.
It would be better if, as in the Hollywood script, the British and the New States were defeated in the face of aliens, and finally the U.S. Naval Corps, in the spirit of saving the Lord, waged a war to save all mankind.
The Minister kept on praying that group could flood the two hundred "human armored cars," but the reality could not be as he wished, when the drone group slammed into a strange nest, already determined the fate of the strange.
As the last swordsman washed off his head with an ion cut, the conference room ravens were silent.
"These hypocrites, they're out of here! They've said there are only two orbital flights, how can there be more than one?"
A U. Department official broke his silence and couldn't help screaming.
Minister Ashton Carter looked at the officer and shook his head.
When others say there are only two orbital air strikes you are sure there are only two?The U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research (D.A.) hasn't gotten a lot of equipment out of it, and it can only be blamed for the lack of intelligence.
But that's also not possible. ghost agent's native counterintelligence capability is really too strong.
Long ago, the CIA wanted to steal technology from space elevators by entering into the circle of trade, but none of these sent to the new country were returning, and some were burned or even vaporized.
Just then, Comrade Hilary, sitting at the table, spoke suddenly.
"I'm more worried about their underground weapons than about the orbital landings and the power armor.
If they could carry dozens of tons of tungsten balls to our heads at any time, it would pose a serious threat to American national security.
All the people who are sitting are nodding.
Although the 1966 Outer Space Treaty refers to the prohibition of arms development in outer space and the "militarization" of space activities, in fact, the vigorous development of military space technology and space forces, the seizure of absolute control over space, and the acquisition of strategic heights to safeguard national security interests have long been common strategic objectives of the various countries.
True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True True
Looking around at all those who were sitting, the CIA director gave a soft cough.
"As for their basic weapons, we're trying to get some tungsten bullets from Ukraine.
According to CIA technicians, this base weapon does not have a high level of technology. It is just an alloy tungsten ball, about the size of a cigar, with a conductive component similar to a gyroscope installed at the center.
"It's easy to simulate their weapons," he said, with a little helplessness in his face. "The key is to get these tungsten balls into synchronous orbit.
Unless these tungsten balls are transported to synchronous orbits at the appropriate cost, the development of a base weapon is completely meaningless.
"Yes," he said.
The White House military adviser laughed, "It would be more than just sending these things into a synchronous orbit and throwing them out again.
And the danger of the circle trade is that there is no sufficiently binding international convention to limit the size of private armed forces.
If they continue to expand their size, we have no way of intervening.
Hearing this, Hilary, with his fingers against the arm of the sofa, he pondered, "What if we now bring about the relevant international convention?
"I'm afraid we'll be the biggest victim.
"You know, we spend a lot of our defense budget every year on military contractors," said Defence Minister Carter.
Needless to say, they have become part of the U.S. Army.
Both the Department and White House officials in the conference room, including Hillary, remained silent.
If the White House were to private military contractors, Wall Street would be the first to jump out.
Moving the military industry is moving the whole of the U.S.
Those,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Next year will be 20 years of elections, can sit in this position, on the one hand, to please the people, on the other hand, can not blame the U.S. financial group too harshly.
With the collapse of Goldman Sachs and the WSPs of Morgan Stanley and First Boston dominating the entire North American financial circle, no one would want to touch the peasants of capital at this time.
What should we do?
Hillary's eyes were locked.
The War ended with the destruction of the power armored brigade after the mother's nest, controlling the military base under the command of Jiangshan.
Victory was won, and the British mechanized brigade arrived at the gate of the military base and presented an application to enter the military base on the side of the Star circle trade.
His reasons were well-prepared, such as "recovering the remains of the fallen soldiers", "and removing the remains of the abandoned armored car", but were still rejected by the Star circle trade.
The reason for rejection is simple.
There is no body at all, and alien captured organisms are eaten by blood at the earliest, and sent to their mothers' nests as high-quality supplements and warming for breeding spores.
Star Ring Trade only promises to send to the British if they find a soldier's card engraved in English.
This is clearly not enough to satisfy the British.
Recovering the remains is the second, and everybody knows that the dead are only afraid of the bones being eaten.
Rather, they wanted to look closely at the Dynamic Arms trade, to gather as much information as possible about this new type of equipment.
Of course, in addition to this layer, they are most worried that X2 bacteria will be traded for themselves.
It has to be said that brutality is too impressive, and the consequences are unimaginable if it is used for military purposes.
The best way to overcome fear is to get one yourself, like a nuclear weapon.
Brig. Gen. Moston made up his mind, that they had entered the military base and had no intention of withdrawing, after all the Star Trade estimates that neither the bottom nor the British directly.
By the time the London research team came, they were saying that they had to study the mechanism of the formation of the mother nest, even if it was not used for military purposes, and that they had to keep it in their own country's stockpiles, in case of need.
However, the circle trade reluctantly denied them, designating the entire military base for private territory.
Finnish officials came up to mediate, and their president, when asked to go to Starring, handed over to Starring the assets of the returned arrow company at a discount of $300 million.
Legally speaking, the Treaty signed between Arrow and the Finnish Government, of course, has passed there.
For example, this military base now belongs to the private asset of the circle trade and is protected by Finnish law.
The Brigadier of the Power Armored Brigade had no intention of talking to Moston, and two soldiers guarding the gate turned him away.
Even if Moston's ten thousand were unwilling, he could restrain himself from returning to the barracks near the town of Partak, giving the news to his superiors before he could make a decision after the Defense Department's study.

CHAPTER 1076
The war passed overnight, and the next morning there was snow in the sky.
By the end of May, the northern hemisphere is approaching summer, but this has nothing to do with the frozen north of Finland.
Within the Arctic, if they were to pass through the Arctic Ocean, they would be able to see the trail of snow until mid-June.
At this moment, the flag of the Star Trade has been raised above the military base near Partak.
Due to multiple bombings, the entire military base could not be seen even a finished building, and after consulting with Finland, Starring Trade borrowed supplies from Russia to be shipped to the base.
The crew who arrived in Mormansk along with the scientific team built camps outside the military base.
Contrary to what Jiang had seen at the end of the world, these improved X2 bacteria are very tenacious, and even if they lose their mother nest, they can survive separately for quite a long time.
And that is why the risk of self-destruction is so great.
Without the injection of the gene, after the inhalation of a certain amount of spore gas, any organism will have a "death" reaction.
In particular, the more brain-the more likely these toxic bacteria are to be affected.
After arriving with a thousand-the first command was to kill the spores floating in the air and eradicate all sources of infection.
Although no drugs have been studied to kill these spores, not everything has to be solved by technology.
These spores are able to extinguish fire, but in turn think that since they extinguish fire by sacrificing themselves, and now there is no mother nest producing spores, the characteristics of fire tend to accelerate their extinction.
You don't need any special antibacterial equipment, a sprayer can produce unexpected effects.
Now the entire military base is still within the scope of the spore cage, and remains in the base in addition to the soldiers armed with the power, only in orange and yellow.
Their bodies were dumped a kilometer outside the military base and poured into gasoline to burn.
The black pillars have been floating from yesterday to the morning of today, and even the small town of Partakh, a few kilometers away, can be seen clearly.
In the commander's room beside the military base, Brigadier-General Clayman had taken off the power armor, and was now wearing a heavy cold suit, standing before the command desk, listening to the reports of his subordinates.
".
Columbia hopes to enter the military base to film underground cover and the remains of the mother nest.
"Let's get them to the circle trade for permission, we are soldiers, we don't have the power to go," said Clement.
This is the fifth time that the media has found the gates to the camp, and now the eyes of the world are focused on the military base, and almost everyone is focusing on the same question, which is how the Star Trade intends to deal with the after.
"In addition, Finnish officials contacted us this morning and the President wished to open a dialogue with us on the treatment of alien bodies.
They hope we can come up with a more environmentally-friendly treatment than through concentrated combustion.
Hearing the report,Cleman picked up his eyebrows.
"Then you tell him to either accept our program or you yourself want to deal with these sources of infection.
If they need, we can send them free to the nearby town warehouse.
"Yes."
The officer stood and turned away from the command.
C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C
But the chair hasn't been blown.
Therm washed, and a soldier ran into the commanding camp, and pulled him out of his sleep.
Their report is only six words, and lets the disturbed dream clerman no temper at all.
Only the officer stands on the way.
Report! The boss is coming.
()
At noon, a helicopter came from the side of the mountain and landed safely on the platform inside the military base.
Intotototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototototo
Though he didn't have to wear this thing, now the spores outside are not low, but it's better not to be too horrifying.
Behind him was the Russian security secretary, Bart, who was also wearing thermal suits tightly and firmly, and counting around a noisy base.
Alice was supposed to follow, but given that she was not going to stay in Finland for two days, she had to return to the island early in the morning.
In front of the power armor, the commander of the Clayman brigade to the morning standing.
Jiang noted to him with approval.
It's hard.
"Where, not hard!"
Cleman grinned.
"What's going on underground?"
"It has been confirmed that the nest has died, without any remains of the alien species.
On the side of the logistics force, the X2 bacterium cleaning is still going on, and a team of scientists from the island of Colo are investigating and taking samples of the remains of the mother nest.
Take us down to see.
"Yes!"
C C C C C C C C C C C C
Following Cleman, Earn and Bart arrived by the giant pit in the center of the base.
This used to be the entrance to the underground shelter, which was bombed a few days ago by a tungsten core from the star circle trade.
After the three arrived at the entrance to the underground bunker located 500 meters below.
This is the inside of the mother nest? The meat bubble on the wall is really bad.
Bart looked at the remains of the wall, and there was a disgusting look on his face.
"You can understand that before the core was destroyed, the mother nest had built up the entire underground covering into its own nest," explained Jiang.
Not far away, researchers are taking samples of the remains of insect eggs.
Unheard DNA codes and the existence of known organisms have completely subverted these scholars' understanding of biology.
Everybody puts a hundred percent of their energy into these precious samples.
These are valuable information for the whole of human civilization.
For harmonious civilization, Jiangshan just a glance far away, say nothing is not enough.
He did not expect to learn anything about the weaknesses of harmonious civilization from the remains of the mother nest, but for the time being it is the only means of understanding them by Earth civilization.
As nobody recognized Jiang's identity on the way, the soldiers who stood there saluted Cleman and opened the way.
Thus, accompanied by Clem, the two came low to the remains of the core of the nest, and set foot.
Looking at the wretched remains, Bart looked at the resin-shaped "coffin" and saw a familiar face through the broken membrane.
"Carman Rothschild?"
"Yes," he said.
You killed him.
"For me," said Bart, "the International Tribunal is his best home."
"It's a problem to keep him," said Jiang softly.
He didn't know what harmonious civilization had revealed to him, and it would have been a problem if the insects had told him their ability to cross.
Now the Rothschild family has produced at least tens of thousands of golden apples, which are a danger to him, to human civilization.
And now he's here to get rid of the danger!
Jiang made a gesture to the next clerman, then pointed to the place of the head of the resin coffin, only to see clerman will pull out the tactical dagger.
Before the head, cut off the resin surface, stretch the steel hand inside, pull out a black ball from inside.
When he saw the black ball, Bart's face was a little subtle.
"Golden Apple," the black ball was taken from Cleman's hand, "and we've always thought it was a tool for communicating the future, but that's not the case.
Communication is their basic ability, their real ability is to wash their brains, to infect their holders in the latent silence, to turn them into their own walking dogs.
Both in the former field and now in Cameroon, they are essentially one kind of people.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Separated from his mask, he could not see Bart's expression, but years of carelessness told him that his purpose was almost accomplished.
Germany is about to win, and Russia is sure to get these golden apples from the rebels, and if they re-experience them with some information, they are unlikely to find anything to study.
Jiang must give them a precaution before they know how to use the golden apple.
Let them be afraid of this thing.
"The most important biological civilization that the golden apple communicates is not from the future. "
It's enough. It's a long, long, long, long look at Bart.
It's right next to us.

Even before the Munich incident, Camen, through a series of means, had the entire power of the Rothschild family in his hands.
After his eldest brother James washed away by the Star Trade in the Pearson Church disaster, the whole family was largely left to him alone.
That's why, with his death, the Rothschild family is almost done.
Jiang could have predicted that the first thing that would have happened in Germany, once the party had won, would have been to liquidate the "crimes" that the Communist Party had committed during its reign.
Not surprisingly, several families, such as Roschild, in Germany assets will be auctioned by banks to offset the courts' fine against them.
It can be predicted that in the coming period, even if Jiangshan does nothing, the Rothschild family will be on the brink of collapse in the frenzy of asset division.
They're just too rich.
It's too weak.
Jiang did not worry about their death, the only thing that worried him was the gold apples that were originally held by Rothschild.
It would have been better if it had been in Carmen's hands, and now that Carmen's dead, these golden apples would have flown out.
Not only in Russia, but also the United States, Britain, France, and even the far-flung countries of China, are sure to be interested in these games.
Harmonious civilization has mastered the communications of the golden apple, and it is difficult to say where the next mother nest will be born if the top of the countries fails to realize the dangers of this.
While sitting on the flight back to Moscow, Bart was thinking about the conversation that morning in the underground bunker, and about the hearing inside the mother's nest...
Are you saying this is the product of your extraterrestrial civilization?
Barta still couldn't believe what Jiang had told him, his eyebrows locked between his eyes, looking at Camen lying in a resin coffin, "and the golden apple is just a brainwashing tool?"
"Yes," said Jiang.
It's unbelievable.
"I know it sounds like a stupid joke, but it is.
On June 15, we will hold the Summit on Outer Space Security in Colo, at which time we will announce all the evidence we have collected on outer space civilization.
I've told you've got the right to take it back.
As a result of the information, Bart was on the ground.
Outside Civilization?
What a joke!
Bart remained unbelievable, even though he had spoken to him in obscurity the last morning in the Mormansk.
He couldn't believe that would happen in front of him, just on a Hollywood screen.
However, when he remembered the serious look on Jiang's face, his heart did not have to whisper again.
If the golden apple really is a brainwashing tool that can unwittingly turn its holder into an extraterrestrial walking dog, then it is really a dangerous thing.
After all, no one can tell who has been brainwashed, and no one who has been brainwashed can stand up and admit.
If a brainwashed man unknowingly made a mother's nest in Russia...
A drop of cold sweated from his forehead.
If you think about it, you don't know how many steps it takes to get from the rebels to the Russian Security Agency.
Aware of the gravity of the problem, Bart set the idea in his mind.
At least wait until June 15 to see what evidence the circle trade can produce.
Before this, the golden apples were temporarily stored and prevented anyone from approaching them again.
If, as he said, the golden apple is a dangerous thing, then it is not too late to destroy it.
Through footage on Finnish Broadcasting, the orbital weapons of the Star circle trade and the cool power armor, spread to every corner of the world.
People who were pessimists because of the British defeat, also because of the victory of the two hundred against the ten thousand, reawakened hope.
Those as ugly as demons, fell one by one in front of the steel armor, the blood of the ink-greens was stripped under a cluster of orange-yellow bullets, especially the last of the short-men, who looked as if they were boiling with blood.
"It's too big. Is it two hundred?
Two Hundred Iron Man?
I just want to ask if you join the star circle trade to have the opportunity to wear that toy?
If so, I'll go to the website to register for foreign troops.
"What do you think, little Robert Donny?"
"The kind of right arm with a laser knife is just too much for me!
Unfortunately, the screen is too blurry, if the camera of the Finnish TV would be a bit higher.
In addition to the unhealthy messages on social platforms, in some military forums, a discussion about the utility of such weapons has been initiated.
The Warrior was divided into two groups, one which believed that game called the power armor could change the pattern of modern warfare, and the other which believed that there was no need for such a surprise.
"It reminds me of a wartime bulletproof armor, with a machine gun inserted on the arm. "I don't think it's a big surprise, but it's a layer of steel on the outside of the mechanical skeleton.
It's better to produce a few tanks or armored cars than to develop a lump of iron that wraps the whole person.
"It's too simple to think upstairs, how did the British mechanized brigade get in? Practice is the only standard for testing the truth!
Infantry with defense, maneuverability, support ability, even anti-armored ability, on the battlefield will be the impossible Lambo! And also the kind that can be produced!
As for welding steel plates out of mechanical outer skeletons, you're talking about Krupp's "Blitz" series? Don't put the products of future man soldiers together, the two are not exactly a class!
Of course, not all public opinion is moving in favour of star circle trade. With the threat of a second “bio-crisis” unleashed, people are relaxing their mouths and starting to reflect on another problem.
What's the point of a boundary if the Star circle trade can deploy in any corner of the world a force as powerful as a division's armored brigade within hours?
At heartened provocation, many peacemakers spontaneously held rallies in major cities such as New York and Los Angeles to protest the use of outer space for military purposes.
However, these protests did not form a climate, even though the mainstream media in Western countries represented the interests of the elite, largely in line with the positions of these protesters, but public opinion on the Internet clearly favoured the star circle trade.
As these days are busy with the Finnish government "reward" has not been focused on the network.
It wasn't until he turned at the Moscow airport that the Star circle's powered armored brigade accidentally fired one.
Such a resulted in the early morning.
He didn't expect the power armor to cause widespread concern among governments, but he didn't expect it to cause such a topic among the people.
It's not clear what the effect will be, but one thing is certain: The high-definition footage on Finnish Broadcasting is almost like a free ad for the Starring Trade, and it's also the kind of thing that has the effect of...

CHAPTER 10
A few days have passed since the military operation to clear the mother's nest, and the White House and the Pentagon have held dozens of small meetings around the business.
No matter what you do, within three days I'll see Darpa separate from the mechanical exoskeleton project, and I'll talk to Congress about the budget.
According to the Minister of Defence, this power armor is provisionally positioned as a fire support for the infantry battalion, and in addition to the three protection functions of loading at least 50 kg of ammunition and nuclear biodegradation, it must also have absolute protection against ammunition with a diameter of less than 12.7 mm..."
At this moment, in a small conference room in the White House, Hillary began a separate meeting with the director of Darpa.
Darpa is an abbreviation for the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects.
In many defence and space programs, images of darpa can be seen, including the parade spray of the anti-emp weapon, which is a product designed jointly by darpa and Lockheed Martin.
Star Trade is already ahead of the U.S. in defense technology, Hillary has to put hope in darpa.
Carefully recorded Hillary's request, director darpa turned two circles of pen, the nose pointed slightly on the notebook.
"We're going to do it as soon as possible. Lockheed Martin has made good progress in the study of mechanical outer skeletons and we have the available technical resources to use.
In addition, I suggest that we engage with the German side, to see if we can get information from the Krupp Group on improved outer skeletons, which obviously already have the prototype of the power armor, but have a few design shortcomings.
"I'll let Kerry talk about it," said Hilary.
After exchanging some details with Mrs. President, Mr. Darpa joined his notebook and gave his farewell.
There were several meetings waiting for him, and he had to prepare the plan within two days to catch up with the hearing of the Congressional Budget Committee on the third day.
This is a multi-billion-dollar R&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; involves a multi-billion-dollar R&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp
Going to the door ready to open, the meeting room door was pushed, the White House assistant with a document went in.
"Mr. President."
Hilary, looking at her assistant, asked seriously.
"What is it?"
"The president of the new country has sent us an invitation.
On his way to Hilary, the assistant put the papers on the table, "It's about inviting us to the Extraterrestrial Security Summit on June 15."
"External Space Security Summit" """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Star circle trade is a good idea to open the space security summit? Who is to use space resources to develop weapons?
"I write a kind letter of rejection saying that the U.S. regrets the violation of the Outer Space Treaty and will not initiate high-level bilateral talks with the new countries before explaining it to the new countries.
"Yes."
The assistant pointed and turned away.
Sitting on a chair, Hilary rubbed the tired corner of the eye.
Ten minutes later there was a meeting, and as she was preparing to take a nap in her busyness, she suddenly noticed the invitation.
After a moment of hesitation, she took the invitation out of the paper bag, according to the principle of diplomatic ceremony.
When the eye swept through the two lines, captured a key word Hillary, suddenly was there.
"External Civilization?"
Their colours were constantly changing according to the letters of invitation.
When she read the last line, she threw the invitation on the table, immediately got up, and hurried out the door.
In the early hours of June 1, a Gulf liner landed at the airport of Colo.
Amid a crowd of bodyguards, Jiang ran through the special passage, came to his lorry, waited for the bodyguard to pull the door, and sat in the steering seat.
Aisha, sitting in the driving seat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Today, the main traffic corridor in the center of the city has been completed with a magnetic suspension, and almost half of the private cars are flying in half the air.
The rivers and the neon on both sides of the street, the whole city is like a shining pearl, dreamy and beautiful, under the illumination of the high buildings and lighthouses.
It's hard to imagine what it was like four years ago.
On the car, Jian accidentally received a phone call from the Warner brothers.
Christopher Nolan, who had a relationship with him, offered to contact him, saying that the Warner brothers were very interested in moving the scene to a "larger" screen, and would like him to come down to the mouths of the early mornings to see if the Starring could help with the shooting.
Taking into account the positive propaganda of the Star Trade, Jiang accepted the proposal of the Warner Brothers, saying that as long as the Star Trade played a positive role in the play, the Star Trade could provide free help to the filming.
Hang up the phone, Eang morning take the full screen, stretch a laziness.
After two flights, he hasn't fully fallen by the time, and now the whole people are sick.
Aisha looked at the morning, a little worried.
What about over there in Finland?
All right, let's get busy.
Have you seen Natasha?
"I saw one before I got on the plane and she asked me for a dinner.
Jiang looked over her face, and she smiled, and her hand dropped from the top of her head, and she rolled around her thin and healthy waist.
Don't always ask me, what about you, I don't think about me these days?
His cheeks were a little red, said Aisha.
"I think every day.
Feeling the unfaithful move of the hand, the Aisha bureau hastily twisted the body, but no resistance.
Do not worry about traffic Jiangshan, magnetic suspension can be said to be more than ten times safer than driving on the road, the track at a particular height is limited by the intelligent program can only keep a particular speed, and after entering the highest cruise track can even completely leave the steering wheel, give the driving power to the intelligent program to execute.
Initially Jiang was still wrapping her waist, but soon had to step into the scale.
However, the little sheep are too gentle, so that the hand is constantly upward...
With a slight bite of the lower lip, no more can suppress the feelings of the heart, full of the tide. Red Aisha put the car on the cruise track, gave the driving completely to the intelligent driving system, hands completely away from the steering wheel, like clay cleverly turned to sit on the morning's legs.
His arms held up his neck, and Aisha blinked with a clear, blue stone eyes.
Being so stared, in contrast to the previous unreliable Jiangshan was a bit embarrassed.
"Well, drive well-"
Before the words were finished, Jiang's lips were blocked by hot and delicate lips.
The young snake pierced through the teeth, and a cold and gentle hand walked down to his firm arms.
Separated from the ink glass, beside the two flies the overflowing street.
Under these conditions, everything is as natural as water to canal.
Jiang sensed that tiredness accumulated over the days gradually dissipated with the warmth of the skin.
Just in the brightness of the night, a speed and passion is being shown.

Chapter 1079
The third lifted his head and looked at the clock hanging from the wall, and the rain of summer sighed deeply, and whispered in a small voice, "Why have you not come back so late?
About half an hour ago,Isa drove to the airport to take her home in the morning, and she went to the bathroom to take a shower.
It's summer. It's hot. After bathing, it's not too hot to change clothes.
Instead, he wrapped his wet hair with a white towel, and sat on the sofa in the living room surrounded by a bath towel.
A glance at himself, breathing rapidly, a summer poem rain's mouth corner not bend a shallow smile.
Suddenly, realizing that I was thinking very shameful thing, the rain face suddenly red, holding the fist slightly coughed, quickly breathed a few breaths, adjusted his state, again changed to the non-spoken smile, freshly despoiled look.
Only the look out of the window, and the love and expectation in the eyes, have had her deer-scrambled mentality.
It's been a little more than a minute.
Looking again at the clock hanging on the wall, the face of summer poet rain gradually not hanging, began to be a little worried.
Will it be a traffic jam?
It's not possible. how is the car stuck?
Did anything happen on the way?
Thinking about this, Xi could not sit down, hastened to pick up the phone on the tea, to give to Jiang Morning.
The phone rang for a long time, and no one listened.
Then she called Aisha, and the phone was turned off.
It's a little hurrying.
Just as she was about to change her clothes and go out to see, there was a sound outside the villa to open the door.
The light flashed slightly, and the familiar Renault entered the garage, and soon the two pushed the door into the hall.
Seeing the two gently returned, the summer poetry loosened the mouth, went forward, looked at Jiang morning some questioning.
Why did you come back so late?
Jiang laughed embarrasment, "I've been on the way for a while, why haven't I slept?
The rain fox looked at the morning.
No, if he were to see himself wrapped in a bath cloth, there would have been an unnatural reaction. Isn't that what he looks like now?
Where did she know, just finished four-haired morning, now in the wise mode, not to say wrapped in a bath cloth, put together a bath will not have a strange reaction!
Not aware of what was strange, seen by the suspicious eye some hair,
Jiang shut up and touched his face, he said.
"Is there anything on my face?"
Therm shook his head and looked again at Aisha.
Aisha washed her face,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
See, Jiang's reaction came at once, a quiet.
It's bad!
Indeed, the summer rain at once understood what, laughing squinted to the side of the River Morning, two hands "softly" held his arm.
There's something I'll help you with.
The fragrance of the flower penetrated the nose of the morning, and the moist hair was covered with water, and looked down to the beautiful face, which was a way to the deep white.
Being so closely attached, Jiang morning pain and happy reacted.
There's a lot of stuff, said Jiang, carefully looking at his side, and no hesitation in pointing at his head.
Come on, let's go upstairs, and I'll help you clean up.
When he had finished, he dragged his bath towel in front of his chest, and dragged his hand up to the stairs.
Jiang's expressions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was hot in the summers, and now it's sticky, and she can't wait to take a shower, and then to go back to her bedroom and sleep.
Until midday, Jiang began to sit down from the bed with his sleepy eyes.
The beautiful who fell asleep with him last night.
It is often said that there are only dead cows, and no cultivated fields.
Last night he worked out, with the empty body deceived the Xiu Xiu and asked for forgiveness, didn't think that the honorable woman president, the next day can climb up to work on time.
Thinking about this, Jiang shook his head and laughed, and lifted his air-conditioner, and fell onto the bed.
Hearing the sound of the bedroom, the handsome Aisha came in with her clothes, gently changed her clothes, and asked in his ears, What is the arrangement for today?
"Yes," said Jiang, rubbing Aisha's hair, "all day with you two.
Enjoying the warm hand, Aisha smiled gently and said softly, "Come with my sister, she is always at home alone, I have occasion to go out with you.
Though she rarely speaks, I can feel that she is not inferior to me in her love for you.
Looking at the clear eyes, Jiang suddenly felt a little sorry for her, opened his mouth just to say something, but was gently pointed to the lips.
Don't say anything.
Aise stood up and kissed him gently.
She looked at him with love, she stretched out her hand, and shed her tie for him.
Get ready for lunch.
Looking at the beauty that was close to her, Jiangshan's heart was a little fluctuating, unwillingly stretched out his hand to hold her waist, and he spoke softly to her ears.
Can I eat you first?
"No, you have to go to the company in the afternoon."
She put her head down and touched her chest gently with her forehead, she said softly, "Don't delay the right thing, lest my sister-in-law become jealous again.
Even though Jiangshan was sure that if he insisted, Aisha would surely not resist, but given the harmony of the vinegar bowl with the summer poem rain, he still listened to the little girl's advice.
After the two had lunch, Jiang sat on the sofa for a while, then drove to the company.
By the elevator came to the top of the building, and on the way to the door of the summer poem rain, Jiang Shun the way and greeted her.
Even though there was no expression in his mouth, Jiang had a very clear feeling when he saw himself appear here in the afternoon, the summer poem rain was very pleasant.
What she cared about was not whether she cared about her own work, she was used to doing the heavy work for her, but whether she was willing to spend more time with herself.
She didn't ask Jiang to pour in her feelings, can more than with him born to die Aisha, she only hoped in her feelings at least not to be thrown away too far...
Going into his own office, Jiang had the beauty secretary help him with a cup of coffee, by the way, to call the CEO of Futures Bank David Smith from the floor.
Soon Mr. Smith appeared before his desk.
Since it was working time, Jiang morning did not have a cold, open the door to see the mountains, said.
"Within three days, I'll see a new $15 billion in futures bank accounts that can be controlled freely.
Additionally, I uploaded the reports from Daimler BMW Volkswagen Group to my mailbox.
Yes, there are some companies in Germany that are at the top of the electrical industry.
At the end of the morning, the two words of surprise were written on Smith's face.
As a senior financial practitioner, nothing about capital internationally escapes his eyes.
Needless to say, Futures Bank is preparing for a downturn in the European economy, where liquidity is already available, and where his team is now studying is just where the profits are high, and where the success rates are high.
Daimler BMW Volkswagen are, of course, the best choices for investment.
It's just that's not what you want to buy. Even if you get a double premium, it's going to depend on whether the German government is willing to sell it to you.
But Smith did not expect his boss to be so generous that even the branches of the German automobile industry, such as Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen, could have taken over.
"No problem.
Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise Surprise
Then go.
"Yes."
After Smith left, Eang Morning took Mocca's coffee from the beauty secretary's hand, and sat on the chair and smelled her mouth.
The war is over, the money is gone, the blood is almost gone.
On the eve of victory, the stubborn Camen died in Finland, and the Communists, led by the Rothschild family, were unable to return.
It's going to be the big story of the whole war.
It's time to share!

Chapter 1080
A German man washed his luggage at a fast hotel in the northwestern city of Bremen.
Perhaps because he was too panic, he accidentally touched the phone on the table on the ground.
At his sight, he bent and picked up his cell phone, and put it in his pocket.
"That's not enough," said the old man, "that's not enough!
Oh! Oh!
While cursing, he joined the packed baggage, and walked to the door.
Karl Krupp, was a good name in the German upper class.
Now, however, he lives like a street rat, dressed in a hundred-euro-one clothing, lives in a cheap fast-food hotel, and has to go out ink and baseball caps, afraid of being recognized.
I don't know why he suddenly remembered his brother, Glenn Krupp, the man who was strongly opposed to joining the Rothschild family, who was the heart of the Krupp family.
If he hadn't been blinded by the power to remind him of Camen that night, maybe today's Krupp family would be another end.
Standing on the elevator, he shook his head hard, away from the unrealistic thoughts.
Thinking about this problem has no half what it does to itself.
Adjusting his emotions, looking at the decreasing number of floors at the elevator door, Calvert's heart was burning with a little hope.
As long as he successfully escaped to South America, where he hid for a while, waited for the winds to pass completely, and then operated through offshore companies, quietly diverted the money from his existence in the Cayman Islands, he could still continue to be rich in South America.
One billion dollars is enough for the rest of his life.
As for the Krupp family, he has two brothers and one sister, who cares who cares!
When the elevator reached the first floor, Calfter loosened his breath and walked out the door with his hand luggage.
At this moment, however, four men in black suits noticed him, and rose from their chairs and surrounded him from the four directions of the hotel hall.
Noticing himself being watched, Calvert's face flashed like a bird of the bow.
He just wanted to turn to escape, but found his way back had been sealed, and he had no way to escape.
After a few seconds, he was surrounded by four black men.
The man standing opposite him, took out from his chest a certificate, said facelessly.
Hello, are you Mr. Calvert?
Are you mistaken?
Calvert said,I'm Francis Ode, the head of a food processing company in South America, and this is just for a visit to Germany.
But the man didn't even understand his words, he continued.
"We are agents of the Federal Constitutional Guard.
You are now facing at least twenty charges of treason, Mr. Calvert, please come with us.
Calvert panicked, and crashed into the man next to him, trying to escape.
However, where he had his little board hit by a long-time sand-the man next to him did not move at all, and he controlled his hands lightly.
"No! I'm not going anywhere! I've got to get on the plane!
As he struggled for the last time, Calvert screamed, and his noses were everywhere, and the more miserable the more miserable it was.
When the agent of the Federal Constitutional Guard saw that Calvert had no intention of cooperating with him, he ceased to speak to him, gestured to the assistant next to him, and said.
Take it away.
"Yes!"
On 3 June, the German People's Liberation Front soldiers entered Berlin with no bloodshed, and the people of Berlin were greeted.
This long struggle of months came to a successful end in a month of armed struggle.
On 5 June, Ewing returned from Russia to the Prime Minister's residence in Berlin, where he ended his years of exile and, as the leader of the Communist Party of Germany, took the oath of office before the whole of the German people.
On the same afternoon, a total of 27 members of the newly elected party were prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against the federal constitution, and the maximum sentence was life imprisonment without parole.
Meanwhile, several European firms, including Rothschild Bank and Krupp Group, suspected of providing massive political donations to the new party, were prosecuted by the German government. The Supreme Court immediately frozen their assets in Germany and initiated proceedings as quickly as possible.
If convicted, Rothschild Bank fears being sentenced to a €1 trillion fine.
There's no doubt that's not enough money for the present Rothschild family.
Following the judgment, several company shares held by Rothschild Bank will be returned to Germany for auction by several banks.
The proceeds from the auction will be returned to the state treasury for the recovery of Germany's stagnant economy.
According to the agreement, Jiangshan acquired shares in the three top auto groups from within the German government at a 20% premium, replacing European conglomerates such as Rothschild as the first shareholders in the three European auto companies.
EU integration is expected to fail, and the euro continues to fall.
The euro dropped to the lowest exchange rate for the new currency, even to 1:3, to the tune of EUR 15 billion, and finally to the foreign exchange markets at a price of EUR 4 trillion.
Two trillion euros are loans from Futures Bank to the German Central Bank, One trillion euros are for the acquisition of 37% of Volkswagen, 41% of Daimler, 39% of BMW, and One trillion euros are for an interim initiative by Jiangshan, adding to investments in five electrical companies, including Siemens and Bosch.
The Future Group, led by Mr Jiang, has become the biggest winner in the ceremony of splitting up the European funds.
Both of Germany's two-pillar industries are labeled Futures.
Jiang had plans to buy the Krupp group, but this time Evelin has not spoken so well.
Needless to say, Krupp is the heart of German industry, and even if they were on the wrong side of the newly elected party, the German Supreme Court did not punish them excessively.
Moreover, the Krupps were traditional Prussian nobility, not Jewish in themselves, and did not enter the communist core.
Following the rise of the new owners, the Krubers were firmly on the side of the victors, as if they had abandoned their relations with the Rothschild family and the Communists.
Even if Evelyn did not want to go overboard, the page was revealed.
The EU integration process can not even pass a hundred days, the drama of the death of Carmen,

CHAPTER 1081
As the heart of the European Union, the victory of the Germans has encouraged the people of Europe in the heat of water.
The Fall of the Rothschild Empire hastened the “right-leaning” of European countries, and people began to reflect on whether the choices made two years ago were the right ones, and whether the far-right parties had really taken their country in a better direction.
Contrary to the turbulent European situation, the Asian economy on the other side of the globe is steadily rising.
Especially in the western Pacific, which is a vast country, GDP is like sitting in a space elevator.
On 10 June, a delegation from the Government of Japan, led by Chubu Electric and Tokyo Electric, reached an agreement on expanding electricity imports, increasing the total amount of electricity imported by 31 per cent in the second half of the year, to replace the two nuclear power stations that were suspended in the country.
Helium 3 is currently being extracted at a rate far greater than the consumption rate, and the new second nuclear fusion power plant is about to be completed, with considerable capacity left.
For such an agreement, of course, open hands welcome.
Not only in Japan, the most cherished in China market also relaxed on the policy, sent a number of power companies delegation to visit the new country.
As the world's first power utility, China's power market is larger than the second United States and the third India combined.
Even if China eliminated half of the electricity, it could make the circle trade crazy.
By early June, the global grid plan has completed the most critical first step.
With multilateral efforts, thermal cables have successfully covered 80 per cent of the countries and regions across Australia and Asia, with output accounting for 88 per cent of the total domestic output.
Benefit from cheap electricity, according to the share of imported electricity in the total national electricity consumption, the industry cost of the global grid plan member countries has fallen to 1.7%, and the lowest to 0.3%.
Don't take a look at the two drops reflected in billions of units of GDP, the energy generated is unimaginable!
This does not mention the ecological environment, the investment environment, the competitiveness of export products, the promotion of the electrification process, the weakening of domestic industry's dependence on the energy market, etc.
In short, governments who have tasted the sweets have sent out positive signals, sending entrepreneurs on their side to negotiate with new countries to see if they can expand their imports.
The New York Times even claimed that the new state was like a country on a wire.
The Washington Post had a highly satirical cartoon, with a dog chain extending from the West Pacific to the surrounding large, small countries.
No matter what the media reports, the countries that buy tickets are already on high-speed electrified trains, and to taste the sweets they have no reason to jump outside the train.
Through a submarine cable, Jiang's gains are not only a source of continuous cash flow, but also real diplomatic capital.
Why has the dollar dominated global markets for most of the century?
If your own crude production doesn't meet domestic demand, you can only reserve more foreign exchange to avoid risk.
As it is now, countries in Asia are adding new ones.
Even if Colo is not the world’s financial center, the new Fed has the potential to unleash the dollar’s dominance, as the dollar’s rise and fall are affecting industrial and household electricity costs in many countries.
It has nothing to do with finance, it is hard power.
Five Days away from the Summit on Outer Space Security, Jiangshan has sent invitations to ten major countries around the world, and implicitly mentions the topic of the meeting will be related to outer civilization.
To date, all ten countries that received the invitation indicated that they would send high-level foreign ministers to visit.
There is no longer any doubt about the holding of the meeting, and for the Jiangshan side, it is the question of what kind of evidence should be presented at the meeting.
Currently, the space telescopes he carried from the end of the world have been installed in the space elevator, sent to the synchronous orbit.
It wasn't clear what the exact coordinates of the colony were, but it was enough to know where they were coming from and where they were going.
Gliese 581 is about 2 degrees north of the planet Libra, about 20.5 light years from Earth.
As early as the week before the letter was sent, the astronomical observation team of the Department of Trade and Space carried out several days of observation of the galaxy, and finally came to an astonishing...
It's already the news for Jiang.
The probability of life on Gliese 581g is 90%.
"It is unbelievable..."
With a handful of astronomical data in his hand, he entered the office of Jiangshan, and said with an uncanny face, "Your guess is correct, there is indeed the possibility of birth.
But I can be sure that, even if there is life, there is no way that civilization beyond the Stone Age will be born.
Jiang picked up his eyebrows and smiled and asked, Oh, why?
"First of all, the tidal lock, the entire planet's habitable zone is only one of the morning lines, which determines their living space."
Then, and most importantly, the elements of this planet contain a great deal of hydrogen, nitrogen, but a great lack of mineral elements such as iron and aluminum.
Again, according to the gravity data analysis we observed, the largest of the planets is probably the existence of a group of arthropods, even mammals, along the lines of dawn and dusk!
Hearing this, Jiang nodded approvingly.
It is quite remarkable to be able to analyze so much valuable information from such limited information, despite the observations of the 22nd century.
Have you considered another possibility?
"Another possibility," said Claren.
"We have always believed that the development of civilization is linear, from the Stone Age to the Iron Age, from the feudal age to the Industrial Age.
"What's wrong?
"It is impossible to draw conclusions from only one reference system, and we cannot deny the possibility of other forms of existence because the development of human civilization is linear," said Mr. Jiang.
You're saying a bunch of insects might be breeding civilization
Calvin shook his head, and when he thought they had no hands, he suddenly froze.
He suddenly remembered the previous period of the Star circle trade's military operation against northern Finland's moss.
There, the star circle trade attracted a powerful armored journey, encountered seems to be a group of aliens climbing from insect eggs.
Why would Jian let the Department of Star Trade observe the Gliese Galaxy, why would Ji Jianan suddenly go to Finland before the X2 bacteria outbreak, why would Jiananan be so sure of the dangers of the mother nest from the start...
All of the clues were put together in Kelvin's mind.
He stared at the morning, and unbelievably pulled out a few words from his throat.
"You're saying..."
"Yes," said Jiang, nodding earnestly, "the beginning and end of the X2 bacteria is not just a research accident, as advertised by the outside world, it is from the beginning a conspiracy to alien civilization."
(Unfinished)
Chapter 1082
Leaving his office in the morning, he repeated in his mind what his boss had just said to him.
Five Days After the Space Security Summit, Star Trade will publicize to the Heads of State the existence of alien civilization, and prove its intention of aggression...
In fact the latter does not need proof.
Both values are completely different civilizations, from the beginning there is no trading option.
Since both are insects in each other's eyes, there seems to be only one way to prove who can continue to be at the top of the food chain.
That's war.
Looking complicatedly at the document in his hand, recalling the boss' assignment to him a minute ago, for the first time in his life, Kelvin felt the burden of the job on his shoulder.
After work, Jiang did not immediately go home, but alone by boat to Coconut Island.
The island had been transformed by him into a junction between the present and the future. Every month, a ship would come and unload delayed supplies, such as food and supplies, and occasionally would carry a load of solid goods sealed with containers.
These boxes contain advanced industrial machinery, the T3 motor armor, and some other high-tech products.
Although the entire island is not manned by soldiers, there is an entire U.S. drone attack battalion.
It's not that idea of the "Mysterious Little Island" has been worked out by outsiders, but by no one.
Arriving on the small island, Eang-shan tied the ship at the dock, confirmed the identity information through the reconnaissance drone, and went to the warehouse in the center of the island.
The corner of the warehouse, where the machine was taken to be called the "King of the Warehouse 1" is located.
Last time Lin passed through this machine a fat autumn rat from the present world to the last world and then passed back from the last world and viewed life from the dimension of 0.
Breakthrough 1 to 1.
Even though there is still a long way to go, this is certainly a good start.
It's just that's not what Jiang had in mind.
Going to sit by the machine, Jiang took out from his pocket several test tubes filled with ink-green liquid, put them in the center of the two disks, then put on a belt with various tubes, and opened the power supply.
Looking at the arc of the jump, he pressed the switch hard on his head.
After a long struggle, transmitting the test tube to the end of the world, Jiang morning three to five to two untie the bound hand, turn off the machine's power, and follow the past.
()
One of these tubes contains material extracted from the remains of the female nest, and several other tube tubes contain spores and insect eggs respectively.
None of the cells in vitro have been exterminated, and even the creeping of unknown substances can be seen through the ink-green culture.
After receiving these test tubes from Jiang's hands, Lin immediately entered the laboratory.
After a long wait, the door of the laboratory opened again, the re-emerging Linling called to the morning of Jiang, then brought him to a special microscope.
In addition to the tubes he had brought, he saw two similar tubes on the test bench.
From the labeled above, he quickly understood where the two test tubes came from.
"The sample you brought is not exactly the same as the one we encountered in the center, but the DNA code is very similar.
What you've encountered is obviously an upgrade, but due to poor development, many of the functions have not been differentiated.
After hearing Lin's introduction, Jiang's eyebrows suddenly twitched.
"Deformation?"
Hundreds of tungsten balls and a whole armored brigade greeted at once, and then bit the hard bone. Did you tell me it was not well-developed?
Lin nodded.
"Yes, if you give it enough organics and give it enough time to work with light, digest those organics and absorb them into its own components, the mother nest will gradually develop into a complete body.
Based on its entire DNA code, it will be an inexhaustible terror existence.
Saying this, Lin paused, and went on with a glee: "I don't think there's any way to clean it up, at least with the available technology.
Each spore cell has the ability to grow into a** nest, and the number of splits is no longer limited, unless we can kill each spore, then one day it will not know from which corner it emerges.
After listening to Lin's narration, the evolution of the mother nest made Jiangshan feel a little cold and cheerful.
For those who have completely abandoned their traditions, the Earth is a completely strange planet.
Whether it is gravity or air or magnetic field, knowing does not necessarily mean being fully adapted.
In the war with them, man first occupy the home advantage.
On this strange soil, however, their abilities have evolved at an incredible rate each time they interact with humans.
It would be difficult to say in what form the harmonious civilization would carry out its plans of aggression when the day of the colony's landing came.
After realizing the deeper seriousness of the problem, Jiang Zhen pondered for a moment, and immediately ordered.
"We organized the information of this maternity, and we focused on analyzing the genetic components of the X2 bacteria and the T-series viruses.
In addition, give me a piece of paper and an electronic file, the electronic file is best to make a common understandable full-spectrum image.
"Hey, are you when I'm your secretary?
"Ten boxes of mango."
"Well...
"It tastes like fifteen boxes of strawberries," said Lin, closing his little mouth for a moment, as if he had made a big concession.
Hearing Lin's words, Jiang laughed and shook his head.
Does this matter to him?
"I'll take you next time.
But again, don't you like mango flavor?
Lin grinned and looked at the side:
There's too much mango, and you haven't finished everything you've given me.
It is not a small task to organize all the information of the mother nest, but it is not difficult for Lin, who is an electronic.
After receiving a promise from Burton, Linling kissed her small chest and promised her that she would be well within three days.
Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go
Before coming to the end of the world, he had already greeted Aisha, and it would not have been a surprise if he had stayed to the end of the world for three days, until the information about the mother's nest had been completely arranged for Linling.
This information will be of great use at the forthcoming Summit on Outer Space Security.
If the international community can get enough attention, it is all on it.

Chapter 1083
An informal Fed shareholders meeting is taking place in the Morgan Building on Wall Street, New York.
The man sitting next to the door is the current owner of the Morgan family Daniel Morgan.
Together with him sat at the table, and the Rockefeller family, representing the Rockefeller family of the Boston Consortium.
Even the Gianni family, the owners of the California conglomerate far west, sent their own representatives.
It is not exaggerated to say that which is qualified to sit at the table, to the Americans, is nothing less than that which is printed on a hundred-dollar bill, and that which is breathable.
The people here can cause three earthquakes in the financial world.
To put it bluntly, at least one-third of the world's capital is embedded in hundreds of square feet of rooms in the region.
"First, let's win together."
Daniel Morgan picked up champagne from the conference table, lifted away, looked around, " Victory belongs to the bee, Wall Street belongs to the bee!"
The English word wasp is appropriate to the contraction of the WASP, usually the members of the WASP will also call themselves by this name.
Old Rockefeller smiled and raised a glass.
There was no more row, and under the leadership of the two big guys, twelve glasses of wine were raised to celebrate the joint victory of the WASP consortium, which was finished with Daniel's lead.
In front of the twelve, with respect, handed over the towels, and after all the big lads had used them, with the drink, took off from the meeting room.
Early, throwing the towels in the hands of the waiter, Daniel hesitated to look at the guests before the meeting table.
Of all the capitalists, he is certainly the youngest, and the most successful.
After all the waited, Daniel gave a gentle applause, indicating that everyone looked to him.
"Yesterday, Morgan Bank completed the acquisition of assets by Roschild Bank, such as shares in Citibank.
So far, I am very honored to announce to you that we have completely kicked out of this street under our feet those disgusting Jews.
There was a ceremonial applause on the desk, and even old Rockefeller gave a gentle applause, but the dull eyes gleamed with a taste.
Daniel nodded, and humbly received the praise of the WSP core members who were sitting behind him, and the name behind him.
When it comes to the Rothschild family's control over the United States, it has to do with the Fed.
As is well known, the Federal Reserve is the equivalent of the U.S. Central Bank, with a great deal of control over the “world money.”
Just throwing out a big stick for raising interest rates could leave some weak economies with their plants dry for a month or two, and their fiscal debts high, like a nuclear weapon in the financial field.
Most importantly, this nuclear weapon is in private hands.
Although members of the Federal Reserve Committee are nominated by the President and appointed by the Senate, they are strictly a federal agency.
Under the Owens Act, however, the Federal Reserve would divide the country into 12 reserve areas, each of which would establish a regional reserve bank with independent legal status.
The shares of the regions are purchased by the member banks of the regions according to their asset proportion.
Take the New York Reserve, where, according to the latest public figures, some of the biggest shareholders are Citi 15 percent, Citi 14 percent, Morgan 9 percent, Hanover 8 percent, and Hanover 7 percent, and behind these banks are often the shadows of financial families such as Rockefeller, Morgan, and Rothschild.
Goldman Sachs washed out as early as last year, and now the Rothschild family is being directly kicked out, with its shares in Cities and Hanovers being split between Rockefeller and Morgan.
If 18 Wall Street was a Jewish and Anglo-Saxon court martial, and the buttons of nuclear weapons were in the hands of two, then 19 Wall Street Street could be called the world of the WASP conglomerate.
Old Rockefeller coughed softly and pulled Daniel out of the drunkness of victory.
Celebrating the victory can be kept to the evening party, all of you, now we have more important things to discuss.
"You said.
Daniel smiled, with no expression of discontent on his face.
Without saying anything, old Rockefeller lifted his hand over his shoulder and moved his finger gently.
The Secretary, standing behind him, took the first two steps, and placed a document respectfully on the table.
Sitting a little, old Rockefeller, wearing gold glasses, reached out to open the file.
"On June 11th, Japan Electric Company and Tokyo Electric Company reached an expanded electricity import agreement with Starring Trade.
According to the year's electricity consumption in Japan last year, the Star circle trade has successfully monopolized 20 percent of the electricity in our children's country.
When this came out, the people who were sitting were looking at each other, even Daniel's eyes were shining with surprise.
"These two reports have not yet entered the disclosure process, and you may have not yet received them, and my report is due to a cabinet official.
Saying this, old Rockefeller looked at the people who were sitting, Believe me, I don't need to say more, you may have felt it too.
"We are losing control of the situation in Asia.
As soon as the word came out, the whole room was filled with laughter.
There are representatives of the major corporations, and the financial giants of Wall Street, with their intelligence and sense of smell, clearly do not see this.
It was just before everyone's energy was drawn to Europe, everyone wasting their brains trying to bite more meat from Rothschild, so that no one would ever turn their attention to the opposite of the Earth.
"The dollar's dominance is being shaken, and it may be wrong to let the Communists fall so quickly."
What can we do? Can we pull them out of the tomb?
"Maybe we can help the Krupps, as long as there are new rivals to hold the group of the future-"
It's more unreal.
Cutting off everybody's discussion, Daniel shakes his head, crossing his fingers in front of his lower jaw, already immersed in the joy of victory, now aware of the lurking crisis before the WASP, "We must balance the circle trade by continuing to expand their influence.
Bad things are happening, and we will be more and more passive if they let their global grid plan go.
"Yes," he said.
Rockefeller nodded, looking around at the people who are here, "I know that there is cooperation between the people who are here and the people who are here in many areas, but if they shake the foundations of the dollar, I think the people who are here are well aware of what that means.
Wall Street's financial empire was built on the dollar.
Wall Street giants have looted the world for nearly a century through both exchange rate and market leverage.
Once the dollar loses its “world currency” ring, central banks shut down and reduce the holding of the dollar, every note issued by the Fed will become a waste paper, and the Wall Street financial empire, piled up on pieces of paper, will become worthless overnight.
The two hours after the meeting, including Daniel, all of them came to their senses from the joy of victory.
The Jewish family had fallen, but their wolf had not yet eaten, and now the tiger was looking at the Pacific shore.
When everyone's interests were threatened, the WASP consortium, unprecedentedly united in two hours, devised a plan to circumvent and block the "Global Grid Plan" for the trading of stars.
After the meeting, the representatives of the major conglomerates rose from their seats and hurried to the outside door.
Daniel Morgan, who presided over the meeting, did not stand up, but leaned on a chair and closed his eyes.
At this moment, he suddenly remembered the guy calling him a month ago, when the old financial tycoon's Roschild family lowered their voices to ask him for help, but he refused without hesitation.
On the contrary, I am so sure that one day in the future, I will be glad to make the choice today.
His fingers touched the desk, and Daniel repeated the words he had spoken, but with a little hesitation, he was no longer as decisive as he had been.
(Unfinished)
CHAPTER 130
"What are you doing? "The old man knocked on his hand with a voice of anger.
"Our grandfather will be here soon. please don't hesitate to do what you want.
The man who led returned.
Grandpa of the East naturally knows who the 'grandfather' means in his mouth.
He's a little confused and doesn't know why he's here.
It's not a good thing to have a party withDK, although everyone in R wants to get out ofDK, but can't at all.
It's just a thought.
After a few minutes, Pei's car arrived.
He came down from the car, and the sight shifted to the nearest car.
And little Lemon saw him, didn't pick up his mask and his hair, and came down from the car.
Wu Liang followed.
"You're here," said Ann.
Pei looked up at her, laughed hard, came to her before, approached her by a few, and said, Oh, the people look at you, too hard to guess, are you
Of course,I don't want them to know who I am, so I'm going to let you in, now's not the time.
Pei took a conscious glance at Wu, "Why are you with him?
There's something.
He straightened himself, turned himself, and said to the house, with a smile on his face, I don't know where my sister has gotten the men of your house house to want to kill her.
As soon as the family heard, the face changed instantly, Pee's sister? Where Pee's sister?
"Mr. Pee's sister... we really don't know anything."
I don't know what to say, now I tell you.
Pei said in a cold voice, Can you hear?
"Now that Mr. Pei has said that is your sister, please take your sister with you," said Mr. Pei. "As for Mr. Lin, whose name is not mentioned in my family register, but is still my family, how shall we deal with him as our family?"
Pei didn't answer, and little Liu said to him, "Brother, he's my boyfriend, and now I have his bones in my belly, and you can't throw him away.
Pei had only wanted to take her, didn't think now it's a bit difficult.
But he's kind of a bully, and it doesn't matter what he wants to do.
Grandma, you heard, this is my brother, both of whom have children, and give them to you, is it not that the children will have no father?
It was too clear to the East Palace, to take away the people, then they would not be able to deal with their grandchildren in the light, so, although some fear the power of theDK, the attitude could not weaken.
"I'm afraid that's not possible," said Mr. Pei. "We have our own family law, and no outsider is allowed to interfere in the handling of our own people."
He's the father of my sister's belly. You're old, don't you have bad ears?
"This morning, when my mother gave me a poisoned meal, I had already decided on the spot with her, before, when the family of the East were trying to design me and Miss Ann and his subordinates into an accidental death, I had already been very clear, now that the name of the East is still on the family register and the family of the East, but now I have no name of the East, now I have a name of Wu, Wu is the name I have now, I am no longer the family of the East!"
Words are generous, Words are cold.
His determination was proved when he spoke to so many people.
This is not what you say! said the old man of the East; Come into my Eastern Houses, for we are the ones who are born, and we are the ones who die!
Madame of the East, I would like to ask you, that your plan to kill Miss Ann has been known to her, and that you are here in the mood to punish me, and that you are not afraid to make a serious intervention on the side of the State of S?
She is a kind of vengeance, you want her life, can she please? Well, I don't have much to say, my time is more precious, and I've taken both of them.
Those who saw the family again, he added, If you don't want to see blood here.
Thus, the family looked at the duck had already cooked completely to fly away.
It's awful for the Grandpa and the Grandpa of the East Palace.
Finally, the old man said directly, count, count, count, count, count, count, count, count.
"We have to go back to S."
Pei glanced at her;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"I'm in a hurry to return, but I promise you a request is also true, tell me, what request?
"Well, my request may be a little difficult..."
Then don't say one makes me feel good.
Pei came over, stared at her,,You really haven't changed a bit, come with me half a month.
What kind of jury?
Same as before.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
"You've cut too much," said Pei, smiling slightly. "For five days, no less, it's about asking for, asking for, you can't say no, it's sure to give you freedom."
"Can I go back to the country first?"
No No No No No
Wu Lin stopped listening to the two talk, and really felt,the two are not one leg?
Are these two people inconsistent relationship?
Sounds like it.
But if it were, the two would have been too shy to face him.
Then let him go back to S. I'll be with you, okay?
"I'm not going to do anything to you.
His words are beyond doubt.
Don't say anything anymore.
Since it is not far from Qing, so soon arrived.
It's a really nice place to be.
Qin, when she saw her moment, was very unhappy, when they entered, she stood and turned white eyes.
Thinking about how her grandfather brought the plague back.
CHAPTER 13
After bringing in the heart and the tea, Qin asked a word, "Grandfather, this is..."
"What's your name?" asked Pei. "I remember saying it."
"I don't care," said Pei. "I'll arrange a room for him."
All right, but do you want to arrange for Miss Ann?
No.
Wu Liang confirmed his own guess, he seems to be living with An Xiao Liang.
Liu finds himself and Pei's eyes wrong, instantly realizes he must have been wrong.
I don't know why she doesn't want anyone to misunderstand her relationship with other men.
Thinking about her own man, she really wasn't.

"All right.
Out of the door, she asked in a low voice, Did you misunderstand my relationship with Pee
"Are you not?
Of course not.I usually sleep on the sofa I just sat on.I used to be locked by him and sleep on the sofa every day.
Does he like you?
"Don't talk," said An, clapping his shoulder. "We'll be here for five days.
"Good."
For a few days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Despite every day thinking of her nutrition, still a few kilos thin.
"I'm afraid I won't be with you for the next few days," said Xiao, looking at the briefing sent by An Xiao Li, to the side of Fan Blue.
What are you going to do?
Xiao didn't tell her about her double personality, and he didn't want to hide it from her, but he did know that the fewer people who knew about it, the better, "there is something important, and I will come back as soon as possible.
"I'm with you.
"Are you not going to make a show?
Come back and keep going.
Xiao reached out and touched her head, and the more she strained him, the more he relied on him, the happier he was.I also wanted you to go with me, because it was the safest time for you to follow me, but this time not.
'What are you going to do?' asked the blue. 'You didn't tell me, I didn't let you go.
Shao looked at her worried eyes, Then you have to keep it secret, absolutely not to tell anyone.
Of course I'm not going to say.
Say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run
"He's got a double," "He's got a second double," "He doesn't know where he's going," "He can't find his way home," "He's probably out of the country," "He doesn't know which country he's going to," "So I've got to call up somebody," "And," "Now," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And," "And
"Who is the Wu family?"
Xiao explained, "The witch family of our country, they once cursed An Xiao Li and lying, then didn't know why suddenly disappeared, now found, just that the latter didn't inherit their family's witchcraft, but found a man like me, this man must know the witch, can catch better, can't catch at least can't let him live.
It felt like hearing a strange thing, Little Lemon will be okay?
"Well, it's fine, I'll come back a few days later."
Then go, I'm not with you don't have time to do anything and take care of me, I'll let my sister-in-law get more bodyguards.
Shao extended his hand to her hair, "I don't know when it will be good to speak?
"Isn't he your teacher? Why don't you call him your teacher?"
"I like it.I used to call him my uncle," he said. "I like it.I used to call him my uncle," he said. "I like it.I used to call him my uncle," he said.
I can't tell you.
Xiao took a bite of her, "I'll wait for the guard to come and go, so now you dial the number of your sister, and I'll tell her.
"All right.
Four Blue took out his cell phone and made a phone call.
"Sister," said Zhong, "I have something to say to you."
"Well," said Yo.
Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four Four
As soon as he heard,,I don't need so much,I just need four.
Not enough.He didn't listen.Come over now.
All right, I'll send people over now.
"Well.
Xiao hung up the phone and arranged for her, "I'm not at home these days, eat well, rest, and when I get to work, I'll get to sleep fast, don't play the phone at night, it's not good for my eyes.
"I know."
Knowing that Zhao has come to R, An Xiao Li's heart a little relaxed, hoping to find Jin's voice quickly.
Come to Qing Ping for two days, she didn't sit there with the paper crane, but sat on the wool carpet on the ground to practice yoga.
Pei Ying, when he saw her yoga moves in various forms, occasionally looked up at her glance, even if there was no communication, and felt that there was a person in the room, the whole person's spirit would be much better.
"You don't have a D now. Who's in charge?"
"BecauseDK was created by him, he is not, but no one who can be compared to him can sit in that position."
He looked at the computer and said, Will you talk to Jin about getting married again?
Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben Ben
She would have answered him with certainty, and would have married again, but she did not know what to say when she thought of the curse.
"How can it be the same?" he disagreed. "Marriage is the best proof of a relationship between two people, two couples, and more Mrs. Chen than Miss Ann when someone calls you."
We'll be together anyway.
"Do you know why I leave you here?" asked Pee.
"Your life is too boring, and you need my spice."
Can't you be so clever?
"I can't," he said.
"That's not all the reason," he chuckled.
"Is there any other reason?"
"If you don't have a heart, I want you to be my woman."
Don't you have a clean habit?
"A really attractive woman, when she attracts the attention of a man, the other see not the things, but her nature, it is better than when I see you, automatically ignore the ones, only see yourself.
CHAPTER 13
Pei looked at her,,I appreciate you very much,I want to be a friend with you can meet often,will you?
Xiao Zheng stood up from the carpet, dressed in socks, and sat on the opposite chair of his desk, with his hands loosely resting on his shoulder, "You are the head of the D.K. department, and my other is the daughter of Mrs. S., so that two people become friends, and in the eyes of others become a group of interests," he said.
So you don't want to?
Liu looked at him, Pei, I appreciate you too, and you are very charming, I mean, not because you have said what I love to hear, you are very talented, but I have a principle, you know?
What is the principle?
"It's not a prejudice not to be friends with any terrorist organization, even if they saved me, because many so-called superficial right-for example, the East Palace family, Pei, my wish is world peace, even though I know this day may never come, even though I know it may come for a long time, but I don't want the world to have wars at the expense of the civilian population, and, I can't bear the rumors that are linked to the D.K., my parents are presidents and presidents, and I can't put pressure on them, because my identity, if it's written by some bad people, will be difficult to finish.
Pei nodded,I know what you said.
"If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If," I mean, "If,
Thought he would say never leaveDK, didn't think he replied, "Who knows later.
After lunch, Pei had something to go, and she and Wu Lian were left in the house, where there was surveillance everywhere, although it was Pei's office, but neither of them could easily move his things.
Qin, when he saw the two were playing cards, and he himself had to bring the tea to the water service, was in the heart of indignation.
"What are you doing? Go get me some cake. I want some.
Qin said, Excuse me, Miss Ann, have you taken this place as your own?
Don't you?
Qin turned out and remembered a word in his mouth, "Eat cake eat fat dead you.
With her cake, she couldn't help saying,I don't know what our grandfather brought you back,I know what to eat and drink.
"I'm going to ask your grandfather, how do I know?" "If Miss Qin is restless, come and play with us."
Qin did not speak.
"Why don't you?
"If our grandfather had known..."
"It's okay, I'll tell him," he said.
"Well, since Miss Ann has invited me, I will be with you for a few rounds," said Qin, as he heard her say.
Anne wants to give her a word, love not play, and give you a face...
But think it's somebody else's plate.
Qin asked, Miss Ann, do you like our grandfather?
Do you want me or do you want me to not like?
I'm asking you like him
"What do I have to tell you my truth.
"If you don't like our grandfather, don't catch him. He looks cold, and he's really serious.
"Are you fishing? "Are you fishing for him? " "Are you fishing for him?"
When Qin heard this, he immediately asked again, Is It Real? Is It Real?
Do you like him?
Qin denied, "No, we are not qualified to think of our grandfather.
"Yeah, he doesn't look like you."
Qin-"
He should like two kinds of women.
Which two types?
"The first type is a simple girl without a city mind, the second type is a strong woman with a mind of her own, a woman who can look at him from the other side, are you one of them?"
Qin shook his head.
"No," he said.
"Why are you joiningDK, Miss Qin?"
"Why not? My whole family joined. Why should I leave?
Isn't it true that's what all the family is joining in? Didn't your mother leave her brain in her stomach when she gave birth to you?
"Look, isn't it what I said?"
Miss Ann, your mouth is poison.
During the five days here, An Xiao Li very quiet and very leisure.
Thought a bit tight, but okay, your feelings are the most important.
Five days don't seem to be short, but in fact a blink of an eye passes. Five days is too short for Pei.
It's too short, but he'll stick to his promise, and let him go.
An is trying to go back, but receives the depression, tells her to find Henry's trace in R.
So, the two go and Xiao will meet.
Xiao Zhong opened the door and when Wu Liang stopped, his eyes looked surprised, "It is really you.
Do We Know?
P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P P
Wu stopped and looked at Li, "What happened to him?
"I've never seen him like this," he said.
Wu Lin stopped and went into the room, and when Xiao had laughed enough to shut the door, he twisted a bottle of mineral water to drink a few cups of water, "I had already guessed it was him, and it is a real life to see a real man today.
"It looks like you know who he is," I said.
Don't you have any real impression on him?
"No."
Xiao fell down on the sofa, long legs naturally spread on the tea, laughing and squinting, "The Wu family is such a talent, I naturally have some memories.
"Don't sell," he said.
"I hear it's a good friend with you."
"I've already known," said Anne. "You've been laughing for so long?I don't know where it is.
"Oh.
I laughed because I thought of the dragon and the look of the dragon thinking of death.
"What's wrong with Guang-"
"It looks like you remembered all about you and your men, and you didn't take any notice of others.
CHAPTER 13
"It looks like that's what you're saying.
"He's a lover with the old one of the Dragons.
An open eyes,You didn't lie to me?
We've had a few times with him, and we've had occasion to say that's not what he likes, it's what's around him.
Wu Lin said,Who is Yu?
"I was the girl around me. "
"What about now?"
"She's married now, and her husband's name is Long Tenze, and we're the boss of an advertising and entertainment company.
Wu stopped and said,Mr Xiao, is that girl with me before?
It's all a lover, but you're definitely not going to make it, because I know that you're dead, and that's what your Wu family did.
That's true, but that's been the past, little lemon, is she good now?
Well, her husband loved her, and had a couple, and lived happily.
"Oh, that's fine.
Wu Lian stopped looking very open,,The dust of the past, we have not met before in this life, indicates that our relationship will end in this life, she can be happy enough in this life, but, do you have a picture?
"Yes," he said.
Ann Liu opened her phone book and found a picture of her eyebrows. This is her eyebrows.
When Wu stopped looking, he smiled, "It's long and pretty.
"Yes, her daughter is super like her, is a little bag face.
"Little Lemon."
"Well?
"Don't tell her about what happened to us. Don't tell her husband. It's okay. I don't want to disturb their peace.
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
That's the right thing to say.
Didn't you find someone else?
"I've sent men to catch him and bring him back to life soon."
Xiao returned to normal, but is he special here to look for you?
Shouldn't it be?I'm not sure, but did you go to the East Palace?
I had a deal with the so-called elder, and I thought how bad it was, I fell down without a few tricks, and the people had brought me back to the country of S.
Ann Liu raised her thumb, "It's great," she said.
Win Win Win.
While Shaw was telling her about Le Blue, she said, "Your studio is supposed to train new people, and Le Blue will not be filming the play.
"It's ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready
But now I've changed my mind and I'm going to let everyone in the world know that she's my woman.
"Wowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowow
Do you know how much I have?
Five billion?
Xiao reached out to open the bottle on the table, and dropped three cups in a row, "Look at me, I'll do the cup, you will.
He lifted his hand slowly to the entrance.
Xiao Liang picked up a cup and handed it to Wu Liang. Then he picked up a cup and drank. Where did you get so much money?
"I stole it."
"Who are you kidding?
Then where do I get my money from?
Lemon stared at him for a few seconds, then Lis took out his phone, and said, Believe me, I have to inform her, I don't know what she's doing.
Xiao took hold of her arm, "I am wrong.
"A little more than a little more than a little more than a little more than a little more than a little more than a little more than a little more," he said.
"In the past, in addition to sleeping, in order to fill the heart, I have been doing business by the way, and many things have been involved, for example, long ago, our Xiao family was a business big house, and to say, I have three sisters, I am the oldest and the only son in the family, and the family has not given me, and many kinds of business have been involved, and then the bigger the bigger, until the last few decades, I have been paying attention to investment in jewellery gold, real estate, earned a lot, and the time has come to take over, and that's when I go back and tell Le Blue, she doesn't really know now.
When did real estate take over?
"The previous year."
"Captain,Captain."
"I'm looking at you are, but it's good that you're picking up on time. Some businessmen will never pick up on time.
"How much do you make? "I've recently started my business in S, and it's a real problem not to have one.
Where are you now?
"Y Country, every few decades, I have to reset my account and log in again. I just have to move my account abroad.
An Xiao Li turned to stop Wu Lian, "What do you plan for your future?
"I don't think about that much for now.
"You can now think, without listening to him," "Have the master of the East Palace, Wu, returned to the State of S?" "I believe that the people over there will soon come and find me at home, and they will certainly believe that I am doing it, and that I will bring your matters by the way, so you can now make plans for your future."
I want to find a woman like me and I like to have a safe day together.
There will be.
The three men were waiting for the news of Xiao's hand, and after two hours, finally returned the specific traces, saying that they were supposed to capture him back, but because they couldn't uniform him, let him run, at this time, they could only get away from the hotel.
Henry pulled off his mask when he saw him in the shadow.
Henry of the distance suddenly, the whole person turned to see her.
And little Lemon ran towards him, and he stood there without moving.
Don't you don't break? Why not listen?
"I just feel so bored at home," he said.
You can't take anyone you want to go to.
Anne tried to reach out to hold his arm, but was pulled out without any trace, "all around me, like a suspect.
CHAPTER 13
And little Lemon, holding his arm, so as not to be anxious to run, but to be afraid of you, to find you quickly.
Why is he here?
It's not for you.
Henry didn't say anything else, and went with her to the depression.
When Henry finds out, Fan Xiang finally gets his breath out.
He rubbed ther of the sun, From when he ran away, till now, his nerves really hadn't stopped for a moment.
After resting for a moment, Huang called to come.
Captain, you're looking for me.
"I'll take you to the office and I'll go right there.
"Yes," he said.
Fan took a shower and changed clothes before going out.
He hasn't seen the sun since he entered the basement.
At this time he appeared very confused, completely unlocked state and appearance.
"No one can count our grandmother, because you were a high school student with our grandmother before, this time our grandmother said, "I'll spare you this time.
The man who was in custody with Xi immediately relaxed his hand.
Zheng himself straight, also know that is not the time to be brave, nothing to say out the door.
"Captain," said Xiao, "how did you release him? Didn't all the cops have to be put to death?
"As grandma told me," he said, "but he's not like those who were sentenced to death."
"He's the most coerced of the first offenders, and he's nothing but a lesson," said Van. "And the other seventy-eight people, who are members of the East Palace family who have arranged for special intelligence to be collected in the State of S, are very serious in our country.
Captain, have you done your hair? Have you taken a bath?
"Well, what?"
This bath has changed clothes again. Xiao Huang touched the bottom of the bath and asked, Captain is going to have an appointment?
"What," he laughed, "I understand that it is a deadly psychological injury for you to see someone go on a date.
Captain, can you not put salt on the wounds?
"Okay, I'm gone. " Van Seong looked at the time and went out.
When I returned to find Henry no more to this day, during several Wuping Yang date him, all he pushed, saying that he was busy, not time to go out with her date.
So now suddenly had a little time, he naturally wanted to fill her.
He is going to find her now.
I didn't call her directly because I wanted to buy a gift for her.
Thermal Hospital is thermal hospital in the city.
Fan's hand had a box of red roses, which he bought for his girlfriend because he thought girls loved flowers.
After going upstairs and seeing the signs of the oral department, he passed by with the gift box.
Take Ping Yang is wearing a toothbrush to a teenage boy, not to see him come in.
When the other doctors saw it, he smiled and greeted, Is it Captain Fan?
"Hello."
Hearing his voice, Wu looked up at him, and at the moment of joy, he said, I'll be right now, you sit first.
"Well," said Van, sitting down, and finding that all the doctors and assistants around him were staring at him, he felt uncomfortable.
It was Fan's first time to see his girlfriend at work. She was wearing a white jacket, wearing a blue mask, and she was working hard.
White adds some charm.
When she was done, looking at the envy of all the female colleagues around her, she felt that she had a particularly refreshing face, and immediately took off her mask and her white coat.
"The last few days have been busy, so now I have time to see you and buy it for you.
Take Ping Yang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well, it should be.
"Well, I had a half-holiday for you, and my family wants to see you.
Take Ping Yang washed over the lid of the gift box, and then a hand handed to him, "We go out and say.
"Well.
They went out together, said Fan, Did your family ask for me?
"Well, let me ask you when you are free to have a meal with you at home," I told them, "you were busy a few days ago."
Then go home this afternoon and eat at home in the evening.
She was most afraid he would refuse, because she had sworn that he would surely go before her foreigner.
All right, I'll call my family now.
"All right.
Wu Ping Yang Lima called his family to announce the news.
After hanging up the phone, she said to Fan, "It's going to my grandfather's house. Do you want to bring some presents?"
"I don't think well yet.
"My foreigner likes the most famous brewery in B. I forgot the name, it's an English name, and it's very fragrant, it's a blue liquid.
"Yes, that's what I've been talking about, and when you go to give him this, he's happy to keep it."
That...................................................................................................
The first time a woman's family came, of course, with presents, which he knew, but with such an expensive present, he felt that it would give the other the illusion that he was a rich and well-paid brother.
In fact, he was not a rich brother, although he had a car and a room for a month and a salary of 20,000, but he was not from the same place as the dragon and the dragon's house and the dragon's house.
His parents were working in the old house, and every day was very hard.
Hearing his words,Wu Ping Yang was a little unhappy at once.What about a bottle of twenty-one thousand?I can drink for a long time.What is wrong with respecting his old man's house?
"There are many ways to respect the old man.
"I'll look after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after after
Wu washed, she asked,What do you want to buy?
"I'll see you in the afternoon.
CHAPTER 13
Wu did not dare to provoke him easily, and did not say the thing again, "This time the main members of our family will probably come together, you go not to be obedient.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
"It's mainly my cousin who wants to see you. My mom says she'll arrange for a meeting at her cousin's house.
Take Ping Yang gave him a warning, "If my family is talking about marriage... what are you going to say to them?
As long as we're here, we'll get to know each other, and it won't be too late to talk about getting married.
Take Ping looked at his head, Then where are we going now?
Where do you want to go?
"Let's go to Vine."
"All right.
He took him back to the Vine, and as soon as she got out of the car, she glanced at the master house, "Sheng, can you take me to see? I would like to know what the house of Mr.
Fan was a little hesitant. Generally, we don't allow anybody to go to his house unless he's allowed or his friends, but since you're my girlfriend, you can't go upstairs unless you look at the living room.
In order not to trouble him, she cleverly pointed, "Well.
Fan went by with her hand, just to the door, looking inside the scene, Wuping Yang shouted, "Wow, really cool!
"Come in," he walked in first.
Take Ping Yang followed him, look left look, last time here only went to his place, completely dare to come here look.
It's so luxurious to see her heart beating. If she's lucky enough to live in a house like this, she'll die too!
After looking, she wanted to look upstairs, but couldn't resist, after all, she had promised him.
Out of here, asked Wu in a low voice, Seong, who saw that aunt just now?
"She's Aunt Chen," "she's in charge of the kitchen," "she's really good at cooking."
That's what it is.
Immediately after noon, Fan, asked her, Will I eat here or take you out to the restaurant?
Here, don't worry about going outside.
"What do you want to eat?" he asked again.
"Do you have anything to eat?" Wu looked up, "I want to eat something good."
If you can satisfy you can satisfy.
"I'd like a red wine and a steak.
Fan Xiang nodded,Well, I'll go to the kitchen and tell you to wait for me in the office first.
"All right.
As she listened, she went to the office, and Van was in charge of the kitchen, and by the way, she made a phone call to Ann.
At this time,R is in the middle of the night,And little lemon is not sleeping at this moment.
"Grandma, have you slept?"
"No, what's wrong with Seung?"
Fan thought to say,Today my girlfriend let me go to her house for dinner, what gift will be good when I go?
"How can I prepare two for her parents?
It's not just her parents.
"It's about me going to her home," said Fan, coughing.
Don't see your parents first, go to her foreigner's house, that's the present to be prepared, too simple is not good, after all, her parents, her uncles, her foreigner, and so on, I don't think to talk about marriage and marriage that step, it's better not to see her relatives first.
"Today," she said, "she likes to drink Blue Ocean, so let me buy him a bottle of this," she said.
"How unreal is this girl," said Anne with a smile. "How long have you been friends with men and women, and have not been married, and now it is not necessary," said she. "You go to the cellar and bring to the outsider a bottle of twenty-three thousand wines, and see how many of her uncles there are, and bring some more good cigarettes, and by the way bring her father's too, one, one, one, one, one.
You don't have to buy in our house, it's been quite a lot, normal people, men only buy hundreds of thousands of things, you are tens of thousands, it's almost.
Fan thought she had reason, "Well, thank you, grandma.
Remember to wear the proper dress when you go.
"I know."
Hang up the phone and Fan is ready to go.
Pack it in a special gift bag.
Then I took it to the office.
Take Ping Yang saw him carrying a gift bag and hurried to ask, "What?
"The wine and the smoke prepared for you and for your uncle and for your uncle."
"What about my mother and my uncle?"
"Nobody needs to buy," said Fan. "It's not about getting married, it's about getting it."
"How can a man buy not a woman? What do you want my aunt and mom to think, and it's the first time you've come in, how can you be sober?"
"How do you do it? These are worth 50,000. Is it worth 50,000 gifts for the first time? It's already quite expensive.
asked Fan, "Will I bring ten thousand gifts for the first time?"
Take Ping looked at him with his lips, "You don't care about me at all, I don't want you to give my mother and my uncle tens of thousands of gifts, but at least buy something to say
"Well, I'll go buy some gifts on the way.
According to the ordinary little boy, at this time already gone, but she knows this can not break, otherwise her family can not easily forgive her.
"Well," he said,"I'm hungry."
"I'll take you to dinner.
"Yeah.
For the first time Fan went to the home, somehow, he did not feel good about the people he loved, the foreigners, the parents, the uncles, the uncles, always felt that their eyes were too exposed, and when they looked at him, it seemed that they wanted to say something, what they were expecting in secret, he could see.
His personality wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They didn't even know how to avoid. First, they asked about when they were going to get married, and then they asked about a lot of things that they couldn't touch.
CHAPTER 13
Take Ping Yang looked a little disappointed, felt a moment of light on his face, said Fanxiang, a small voice beside him, "What does the foreigner ask you, you can't follow the heart of his old family? You don't say anything, it's funny.
"They always ask me what I can't say, what I can do, what I can't say, that's my rule.
"It's not going well," said Wu. "I don't feel like the kind of man he imagined.
"What do you mean?" said Fanxiang, who, in that instant, had caught a look of impatience from her face.
"Nothing."
Van Zhen wanted to walk, but thought came all, and endured until the night.
During dinner, the people on the table always respected him.
Even though he drinks a lot, he is inevitably drunk.
He put another hand saying he could not drink anymore, he had come by car, but Wu Ping Yang's uncle said that when he returned to give the others to drive, he couldn't afford their enthusiastic drink, he drank one after another.
Finally, his stomach was so sick that he decided to stop drinking.
As the left hand, he has always observed one of his own norms, in such an environment, absolutely can not leave himself without personnel.
Otherwise, it is easy for you to be inactive.
His concerns were true, and when Wu's mother made him go to sleep directly at his home, he immediately woke up for a few minutes, not even to say no.
No matter what his family said, he refused resolutely.
When they saw him,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Take Ping Yang rode with him, the car returned to Vine.
Van Zheng leaned on the back of the chair and kept his eyes closed.
But he didn't completely lose consciousness.
When it was time for home, Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai together lifted him from the car, he squinted to Wu Ping Yang said, "You go back..."
"You've been drinking a lot. I'll stay with you."
Sister,we are here.we'll take care of you.
Xiao said, he just said exit, Xiao Huang took a shot at him, "What do you say?
Wu, thinking of himself as a pure girl in front of Van Xuan, pointed at the head, re-entered the car, and told the window, "to give him some wake-up soup."
All right, sister.
When he saw the car went, said Xiao Huang, the sister willing to leave what you do to let her go, you fool.
Didn't you see my captain let her go? That means my captain doesn't want her to stay here.
Xiao Huang asked Fan, "Captain, why do you drink so much?"
"I've been drinking..." "I've been sick in my stomach..." "I've been sick in my stomach..."
He,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Little White called to clean up, and little Huang brought him back into the house.
Go get the kitchen to wake up soup, give him to drink the two people go.
Fan Xiao slept for two or three hours, and when he woke up, besides the pain of the head, the drunkenness was much less, and did not want to sleep at all.
He got up and washed and got out of the door with his clean clothes.
It is now ten o'clock.
When it was time for the night, to see him get up, he made a harp, "Captain, how did you get up?
"He's got a headache. "He's got a dull voice.
"You know I'm not going to let my sister go, let her stay with you, you're not going to sleep, and you're going to sleep.
Little White stared at him, Right, Captain?
Don't yell at your sister.we haven't gotten married yet.What's the matter?My grandmother hasn't gotten married to my grandmother, haven't yelled directly at my grandmother.
"Isn't it a day? " "I don't think you're going to sleep," said Fan.
"Yes, captain!" Xiao shivered, his eyes wide open, striving to beat up his spirit.
Fan Xiang extended hand grasped the mouse, scanned the subdition monitoring.
When he looked, he found his house still lit.
That's all. why isn't she asleep?
"How are you doing with Miss Mu these days?"
It's good, but Miss Mo won't let us serve her.
"Well," asked Fan. "Why?"
Miss Mo said it was very difficult for us to give her three meals a day, and we hoped that we would give her one meal, and that she would be able to cook for herself, and that she would be able to send us some time by the way, so today we had gone to fill up the fridge, and it was nearly enough for Miss Mo Mo Mo to eat for two or three days.
Fan Xiang said a no, and turned out of the office.
It rained outside.
He went out of the big door to his own house.
After pressing the password, Fan Xiang entered slowly, even the sound of closing the door seemed slightly.
When he reached the door of the second bedroom, he knocked the door, and there was her voice, Who is it?
Me.
"Come in."
Fan, pushing the door, found she was sitting on the bed embroidery, "Why not rest?
"I can't sleep.
The late man smelled of wine on him, Did you drink?
Have you taken a shower, brushed your teeth, have you smelled?
"It's light, but it smells good, and it looks like a lot of it."
"I went to your house this afternoon, and ate there at night, and don't let your family get drunk."
Mo put his hand embroidery on the table.
"No," said Ping, "I'll go if you want to see me."
Must have spent a lot of money?
"It's Grandma who got me a bottle of 20,000 wines and a few expensive cigarettes from the warehouse.
Take a deep breath, Captain, do you like Ping?
Fan, staring into her eyes, should like.
She didn't want to have more mouth, but she didn't want to hurt anyone who was good to her. She should have been married to you, as all of her parents, except for my mother, had hoped, and, to be precise, my grandfather had hoped very much. She wasn't completely true to you.
When she said this, her hands were always holding their cushions, but the tone was very gentle.
"It's all a matter," said Van. "I'm not going to get married now," he said. "I'll get to know more about each other and then make decisions."
CHAPTER 13
Mo smiled gently, Captain is so good, Ping will see your good.
"Do you really feel good about me?"
Nature is the best man in the world for me.
Fan never thought she had used the word world, with a smile in her mouth, "I'd rather not have the sun, what about you?
Mo looked at him, captain.
Fan, looking at her likeness, suddenly laughed out,Are you frightened?
"It's late," said Mo. "Let the captain go and rest. I'm in trouble."
Fan smiled,,,,,,,,,,Goodnight.
"Goodnight."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The door was also shut.
She reached out and touched her face.
She had his jokes true, and did not feel any shame at all.
How can you not tell jokes?
Isn't that stupid?
He is the boyfriend of Ping, later is his cousin.
With the three words of his cousin, his eyes were dim, and when she was injured, he would still return to his home.
After all, she can't always hide in a room without going out, she'll have to earn money to pay the debt.
Those Who Love will find her soon.
Just thinking about those things will make you feel like you can live here right now without having to worry about eating or about everything.
She always wanted a warm home.
So it doesn't matter if the boyfriend doesn't have money, she just wants to be good to her, she's willing to work with him on their future.
Now, nothing.
Her hopes were wiped out.
Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu
It was dawn when Ann, Henry, Wu Lin, and Xiao Zhong returned.
Returning to the Vine area, foot on the land here, I felt full of security.
She's taken this place as her own, no, this is her home.
After arranging a room for Wu Lian and Henry went upstairs.
As soon as she entered the bedroom, she kicked the slippers on her feet, pushed to the big bed, and lay heavily on the soft bed.
Have you been asleep so long?
"No, I'll take off my makeup, put on my mask, and sit down and think about what to do next.
Henry went to the bath, and as soon as he came out in the bath, she was lying on the bed, with her legs up, and with her mask.
He wiped his hair, came to her make-up, and began to use her protective skin.
"Your skin is better than mine," he said.
"Are you going to have to wait until you're old?"
"You're not going to get old, you're going to live a long, long time, so don't worry about this.
He's just joking.If I wasn't old,you'd be in trouble.I've been so young,you've become a wrinkled old lady by the age of seventy-eight.
Her eyes shimmered as she heard his disapproval. Then you'll be disappointed, because I won't ever die.
It's such a good wish.
"Is it true what I said?"
Oh, really.
It's true!
He walked on his face, pointed at her head, with his mouth full of digression, "It is all true.
When he saw that he wanted to sit down, he stretched his legs and placed them directly on the side of the bed.
He sat directly on her leg.
"Oh," said little Lemon over, kicking his neck with another foot, "The bed is mine, sleep on your sofa."
Have you written your name?
"If you lie here, I will touch you.
Nevertheless, as long as you don't want to be dumped on the wall again, he pushed his lower leg aside and lay down.
"Henry, you're up to it, up to it."
The rabbit jumped to the wall.
He went downstastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastastasta
He wanted to shrink his hand, and the next moment of pain was put into her mouth.
Henry stared at her,What are you doing to me?
Drink your blood.
Neuropathy.
And little Lemon took his hand out of his mouth, and the tube went to lie on the bed again.
Henry lifted his hand, looked at the glow of the mouth water, showed a disgusting look, sat down to wash his hands before coming out.
It's awful.
"Why don't you kill yourself?"
That's what's called awkwardness?Ann, laughing in a strange way, approached him.I'll tell you something even more awkward, and you promise to be silent for a minute.
"Don't listen.
Listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen listen
He didn't feel good, so he decided to refuse, but his refusal didn't make any difference, because the person who wanted to say it would say it anyway.
Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li Li
Henry's face was about to turn into a tomato.I don't believe you are talking.
And little Lemon went down to the bed and went out.
Ten minutes later she came back.
Take your cell phone to bed, don't believe me, I'll give you a look at the monitoring.
Henry was at this time both contradictory and curious.
Just as she put her cell phone in her hands, a man ran to the bathroom.
He looked at him with a smile, and whispered, Don't believe me, bar of evidence.
Henry had no idea that was what his body would do, making him unbelievable and seemingly unable to stand in front of him for a moment.
He knew that body must have had many contacts with An Xiao Li, because children are the best proof.
But I didn't expect him to kiss her. And to allow her to film!
Their heads were blown up at this moment.
He quickly removed the video completely and then stared out.
And little Lemon stretched out his hand, and put it in her hand, and did not want to say a word.
When she saw him erase the video, she did not hesitate to say, "The video was on my computer, and I copied it.
"Are you going to get a computer expert out of you and let the world see?" he looked at her, a little worried.
CHAPTER 13
"Of course not, but this is a video that came from a time when I was in a rush, and it was saved in a secret file on my computer, but it was deleted just when I was copying it, to make you nervous."
When Henry listened to her words, he was relieved to see that his body had an indescribable relationship with her, but he had no impression, or even no idea, of what it was like.
"It'll be fun."
Isn't that's normal?And little Lemon looked at him with a hand up against his head,Do you want to continue sleeping or get up?
What about you?
I'm not sleeping.I'm going to get up soon.
Then get up and I'll go to sleep.
Dreams are full, reality is fragile, Henry wants to come to sleep, but fails.
At the time of dinner, all the people were sitting, Wu Lin stopped because he was in the other's house, so nobody else seemed to be at home, he was a little restrained.
While everyone was eating hi, the dragon came humming a little song.
Hey, my dear friends, I'm here.
Shao saw him,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What are you doing here?" said Henry.
Of course I think of you!
Roll.
"I haven't eaten yet, let me have one, Aunt Chen, let me have two chopsticks."
"Yes," he said.
This is the dragon in front of the friend.
Dragon took the chopsticks from Aunt Chen and sat down with pleasure.
Who is this? he looked up and stopped at Wu.
Hi, I'm Wu.
As soon as his words came out, Wu stopped.
He remembered the name of the dragon and looked at him.
When he saw his eyes falling on his own, he laughed and said, Why do you look at me?
Wu stopped laughing,No, look at you like a good man.
When a man boasts about himself, the dragon's mouth cracks, Of course, I'm the first good man in S, isn't it?
"The cows have been blown away by you," Henry said unkindly, "and the self-lovers are forgetting their own names."
It's a fact, sister, you say, am I not good for us? What do you not listen to her, she said, one I don't say two, she said to the west, I certainly don't say to the east.
"Well," I admit, "the dragon really didn't say anything to him."
"It's not the first good man in S, but at least it's a good man in front of the ocean.
"You hear me, little man."
Henry can't sit down and eat.
At the end of the breakfast, Xiao was brought by Wu's elder, Wu Hai Hong, and afterwards asked An Xiao Li, "He should be more powerful than the witchcraft, but in fact there's no witchcraft, but I think if he's good at it, he should be able to remove the curse of your lying, do you have a good way to make him willing to go out?"
"It's only a life," he said, "but he doesn't want to live, and maybe he has a number in his heart, and he won't even help us get rid of the curse, after all, to get rid of the curse, he doesn't know the birth of the eight words I've been lying to, he knows how we're going to get him to live again," and so that's not going to work, so it's better to exchange it in another way.
Shao listened,What?
"Their family changed their name and moved to the country of R. I'm well aware that for a family it is extremely difficult to change one's original name, so the descendants are more important than anything.
Xiao Zhong agreed with her, "You're right, so do it, whatever his family is, what's the difference with ordinary people if there's nothing you've been good at?"
Little Lemon nodded,I'm going,you wait here.
"Well.
When An Xiao Li went to the opposite, Long Tian Ze and Wu Lian stopped talking in the living room, didn't see the face of Yan.
Little dragon, what about the ocean?
She went to the studio early. Didn't she pick two boys and one girl at school?
She nodded,Well, what are you two big men talking about?
"I'm not talking.I'm talking about men."
"I find this Wu brother is very humorous," said Ron, laughing.
How could she not see that Wu stopped being funny?
"Yeah, sister, he's funny."
When will Yo return?
Come on, she's gone without breakfast, saying she'll come back for dinner.
Look at the time, and sit straight, "Len stop, you know, Tenze and Yang Yang's daughter and my son ordered a doll.
Wu stopped and said to me, but such a small engagement is something of the tradition.
"I really like our little meatpacks," "and they're really cute," "and they're really long," "and they look like they're really cute."
Dragon Danze had a proud face, and his eyes danced. That's it, that's my careful heart, you don't like it, but you can't.
When he says his little cotton coat, look how happy he is.
Wu stopped smiling and said,I see you are very happy.
Of course.
An is a little reluctant, I said, can you both call it?
Are there any problems?
"Of course there is a problem, you call him Wu brother, I don't know if you think you're saying 'no chest', and when Lian stops you call him 'Long brother', I don't know if you'll be mistaken for calling him 'Long chest', you two are so great, it's only the first time you meet, know... because they don't have any chest to go to Long?
When they heard her analysis, they both laughed involuntarily, which they had not really thought of.
Half an hour later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She was wearing jeans and a white sweater, carrying a bag.
"I'm back," he said.
Ann, my wife, is a friend at home.
"Who are you?" "Who are you?" "Who are you?" "Who are you?"
After a glance, she doubted, This is...
"It's my friend," said Wu. "It's your first time to meet people today."
Mei smiled into the room,,He's grown up.
CHAPTER 13 If You
Wu stopped looking at her, though I really can't remember anything about her, but always felt at her separate kindness.
"Hello."
"Hello," said Yang.
When he came back from this house, he looked at Wu Lian's constant calm, and asked, "What do you feel
"It feels good. I'm really happy to see her so happy.

"I can feel that her husband is really a good man, living with such an optimistic man, it is difficult to have a bad life, I am relieved and happy, as for my future, I want to be relieved for the days to come, to find a girl who will bring me happiness, but to meet a good girl, first of all, to go to more places of girls is the opportunity," said Wu.
"That's the point," agrees Anne.
Not long after returning, Wuhai port was brought forward.
And little Lemon looked at the man in front of him, looking at the age of three and forty, not at all old.
Hello, Mr. Wu, I believe this is someone you are familiar with, who used to be the same as you.
He lifted his eyes cold, He is not worthy to be my Wu family.
Oh.......................................................
"Do you include him?" he said to Wu.
"No, he's changed to Wu, but he's no longer your family, SO, not including him, Mr. Wu, what do I look like now?" "You should be clear about this," said Mr. Wu. "A great nation in R is not worth anything," said Mr. Wu. "A bomb thrown over will probably kill a lot of people," said Mr. Wu. "The nation in R is still in a state of instability, and the situation is in turmoil, so now you're either going to remove our curse, or you're going to protect your people," said Mr. Wu.
"How can I believe you won't go out and talk?" he asked.
"You have no choice now.
"Do you think I have forgotten that your people are planning to put me to death? A man who is a giant who is trying to kill another country, and I am, do you think our country will seek out the State of R? As long as I think I have a lot of ways to make your family do twice as much, and to finish killing, you must want to take a look at it."
Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu Shu
Indeed, if his life were to die, if the whole family were to die, he would be a sinner of the Wu family, and after his death would see how the old ancestor had risen up.
This time, it's really thorough.
"Sister Liu," I said, "I've heard that the play of the well kills, and I'm leaving today."
"What's the difference between killing his play and killing blue? "FallBlue, with his red lips, rubbed them gently on his lips. "Besides running faster in the group than when I first joined it, and when I heard the director say that many of his plays were done for him, and that the man in the fifth play was so often used for him, I don't think it would work in his brother's group.
"It's natural that's what I'm asking for, and it's not possible to allow him to be replaced so often."
"Yes," said Xiao, "When will my brother-in-law come back?"
Come on.
"Oh, I'm hungry. My cousin was thinking about buying you all kinds of delicious things every day.
" Snacks.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
"Oh," said Xiao with his bags behind her, and the many guards outside the door looked at her and followed her.
It's a bit like a queen.
You know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just walk past, a long line.
At the time of the television campaign, the meeting.
Most of the attendees are female fans, her fans, at a glance you know there are few.
After all, although she is a little known, but still with Yan love announcement, in the work, neither TV show, no fan anywhere.
But she didn't know that wasn't just a few, it was actually a dozen.
Hundreds of people come and are really...
The activity was about half an hour, and was about to end, but there was an accident.
When he was going down, it was the closest to the person who came, at this time, there was a fifteen-year-old big tree that jumped straight up, he was not a normal jump, because the bodyguard was by the side, he jumped straight in from under the bodyguard's arm, and with one hand he caught him.
At this moment, the scene is a mess.
Four Blue fell directly onto the body of the bodyguard.
The outside bodyguard almost unconsciously pulled her away, like lightning, and directly dropped her on the ground, all retreated, the fifteen-year-old uncle fell not lightly.
Full Blue was still a little shaky, but she was still calm and left quickly.
He wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!

Xiao, seeing her not speaking, thought she was in a bad mood, hurried to soothe, "Sister Liu, it's okay, didn't you see our bodyguard brother throw the old head out?
Xiao, what do you want to do next?
Little Delighted to see her ask, a little dismayed, "Well, what do you want to do next?
"I want to continue to work with you.
"What if I quit the entertainment?
Xiao looked at her. Then I'd like to follow you.
"If I quit the entertainment world, you can't follow me," "Isn't your home a lot more common?" "You once said that your biggest wish now is to have your own house in City A, right?"
"Well, but now house prices are so high that I can't afford a few thousand dollars a month.
How many deposits do you have now?
"More than 30,000."
How about your sister buying you a room house?
Sister, this is not possible, the cheapest house in one room is one or two million, and I have not been with Sister for so long, is not it, Sister Blue you are so good to me.
CHAPTER 13
Don't you
"No," answered Xiao. "You don't make money," said Xiao. "It's hard to make money," said Xiao. "You'll stay alone," said Xiao. "I'm sure one day I'll make enough money to pay for it."
Without saying anything, when she returned to the hotel, she sat alone on the bed browsing the internet.
It's not too long, but it's been about a year.
It's almost every day with her evening, and it's not going to be like this anymore when she's out of the entertainment.
She wants to do something for little pleasure.
After all, she was always very good to herself, caring for herself, caring for herself.
When the doorbell rang, she had a look at several neighborhoods.
There was a guard at the door, so she didn't look at the cat's eyes, but she opened the door, and saw the man at the door, whose blue eyebrows were full of laughter, "Are you back?
"Yeah. "He entered the door and closed it with his hand.
He hugged her and walked toward her.
"Looking at the house.
"Look at the house," said Xiao, placing her on the bed, and looking at the notebook on the bed table.
"One room," he couldn't understand, "it's better to have a bigger house.
"It's not for us, it's for the little ones."
Xiao took off her shoes. She had money to buy a house.
Of course I want to buy her.
He sat beside her, extending his hand over her shoulder, But which one do you see?
"Look, this, and this," she said to him one by one, holding the mouse.
"I think the three bridges are good, and the wind is good," he said. "Yes," he said. "Isn't An Xiao Li's house there?
When she saw that was right, she decided to do it, and after remembering how the owner had contacted her, she asked, "If we don't want our house to be properly housed, we'll have to wait for a while before it's finished, and after it's finished, we won't be able to stay on our horses, and we'll have to dry it for a few months."
"It doesn't take so much trouble to renovate," he said. "It's easy to buy a house that's been fully renovated," he said. "I've asked Captain Fan," he said.
"The villa," asked the blue, "is it like the house of the sisters?"
Almost.
"Then buy it."
"All right.
"I washed away by an old man while I was at the event today.
When she saw the light of his eyes lit up, she said, Fortunately, our bodyguard was also a bodyguard, and he was thrown out in the next second.
After taking away the computer and the desk, he sat down next to him, and faced him with earnestness, and said, honestly, did you think of me these days
"I don't think about you, think about the little dog.
She pretended,You're the little dog.
He lay down with her.I am a little dog.You are a woman sleeping with a little dog.

"It's all done," said Mr.
Almost, but it's funny.
He turned, Let me tell you.
"Well, I'll wash my ears and listen."
Hospital. Ann and Henry are at the hospital to see Father.
Hearing Fan's father had awakened, and had nothing to do with it, all he had to do was rest in the hospital, Henry didn't think of it, and it was little Lemon who wanted him to come.
As the two entered the hospital, while his father was looking at the papers, when he saw the two of them, he nodded, "It has been so many days, that you, the son, have come to see me, and have spoken in the past?
Henry said,It's hard to see you, but what do you think?
It's hard to say, I'm your dad!
You know that's my dad Henry's coldness doesn't mean he's too much.
His father wasted his breath, and put the newspaper on his bed.
"Uncle, how are you?" asked An, dropping the fruit.
"Well, it's much better.
It's been uncomfortable for a few days, and he didn't come to see you, but he remembered you, and he said, "Uncle, can you not go to the casino? I remember you never went to the casino before, and if you feel bored today, you can go to those who are about the same age as you, and take part in some kind of entertainment, which is more realistic."
"What is good about those you don't know?
It doesn't mean.
"Yes, but it's interesting to lose money.
Henry said,I'm lying in the hospital.I can't bet.
Don't you're not happy with me all day?
Henry didn't say a word, grabbed an little lemon's arm, twisted his head and went.
When he came to the door, he loosened her arm and said, I said before that you should not come to see him.
"Your dad's in the hospital, and you don't want to get in somebody's mouth and say something you can't hear," he said.
He was very reluctant to come to see him, and I would rather go to see the wealth and riches of the house.
"Okay, look, let's go back."
After all, coming to the hospital is to have seen the father.
But there's still a place to go.
When he saw that direction was not to the Viney area, he asked, Where are you going?
"Go to the devil training camp."
He didn't say anything else. He lets the car go to the devil's training camp.
On the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The kids like it.
It's been an hour since we got back here.
Wu had promised to remove the curse for them, only to wait for the day of the birthday, October 16.
It'll be here soon, and it won't be long.
As a result, Wu Hai Port was temporarily detained.
She had a special enquiry about Wu Lian's stay abroad. She was thinking about transferring her account to the country of S, but she didn't think about selling it directly there.
He went to the public security office to apply for his own account.
Since he's been greeted, he's been there.
Come back and find that little lemon is drinking coffee waiting.
"I almost forgot one thing.
"What?"
There's one thing you didn't answer to me, and that's that you first told the people on your side that they wanted my hair.
When it comes to the question, he is somewhat uncomfortable.
CHAPTER 13 If You
"I didn't mean to tell you, but I had a very bold idea when I saw that painting.
What's your idea?
"I'd like to make a diagnosis of your hair to see if I have any blood ties.

"That's why I didn't tell you," he said.
"It's not very uncomfortable.
As her voice dropped, a little green voice came out of the door, "Grandma, the family of the East Palace abroad are here, just outside the big door.
It'll come sooner than I expected.
Let them in.
"Yes," he said.
"Do I want to...?" he asked.
"No, what to avoid, and fear they won't succeed?"
"No," he said.
And little Zi shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake shake
"Okay, Grandma."
Those who came were some of the sons and some of the grandchildren of the Grand Master.
With no exception, the East Palace family are the most respected, and are all men.
"Please sit."
Sixty-one of them sat down, and the first to speak was the eldest son of the old lord of the East Palace, "Miss Ann, the purpose of our coming here is first to apologize to you, and secondly, to hope that you will let our father go.
"I'm sorry, but I've left your father. What's this about? I don't know your father. Who is he? What's his father? What's his name?"
Wu didn't think she'd denied it directly, seemed to guess why she did so, and didn't say anything, sat there quietly.
It's just that some of the men of the East Palace were just a little confused, and she didn't think she'd denied it.
Miss Ann, we know that is where the elders are.
"Is there any evidence?"
A few looked at each other, but we are sure that is where you are.
"I'm sorry," she said. "I'm sorry," she said. "I'm sorry," she said. "I'm sorry," she said. "I'm sorry," she said.
Miss Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann
Would you like to repeat my words? She was not surprised. I really didn't take away the so-called elders of your East Palace.
But they didn't believe what she said, and they knew she didn't confess.
A few people didn't know what to do next.
Of course they didn't know that's what they were going to do, because she couldn't have let Wu Hai Hong live any longer.
Miss Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann Ann
Wu Lin stopped the whole people stuck.
"Why did your father...
"She didn't finish," she said.
"Our eastern house has lost its witchcraft, and the old man is the only one who knows, and if he is not there is no hope of reviving.
"Rejuvenation" said An, laughing, "Are you going to spread the great witch, so as to continue to harm people?"
"I don't mean that.
"I'm really sorry I didn't take your elder and I don't know who he is. I'm sorry, but if there's nothing else, please come back.
He's sent orders.
The family had no way at once, even the last of the killers, when they saw that she was still not doing anything, they really had no way.
That's it.
Emperor of the East fell down.
"What are you doing? I have never seen the elders of your family.
Finally they left.
There's no way.
There was silence in the room, and Xiao Li looked at Wu Liang, and asked, "Do you think I am also uncompassionate?
"No," Wu said, "I understand what you are thinking, and what you are doing in your position is right. I am now separated from the East Palace family, so it is a matter for other families, and I will not comment on it.
"When the curse is gone, even if the whole thing is gone, to tell the truth, when it is gone, it is you who I thank most. If you hadn't taken the initiative to contact me, I wouldn't have known the existence of this person, or to say, even if I knew the existence of you, it would have taken a long time, and if it wasn't you, I wouldn't have known these things in such a short time.
"I'm glad to be able to help you with this," he said. "It's really strange that fate has brought me together in this way."
Henry, when he came down from the stairs, had a moment to look at him and to laugh at him. He stood at the door of the stairs and cried without hesitation to him, "Come up, I'll tell you something.
"What is it?
"Come up," he said, turning himself up, "and little lemon really thought he had something to do, and after he went up, he knew he had nothing to do with it.
Didn't you say something?
"What's the matter?
Without saying anything, he glanced at him, "Well, you'll be fine, I'll go down."
Hold on.
What's the matter?
When did you let that guy go?
"Sit here for a while," said An, thinking of how to arrange for him after the curse has been lifted and after Wu's address has been approved.
Henry was unhappy.I think there are strangers at home that make me unhappy.
It wouldn't have been nice.
"And little lemon, this is my dish!"
So you admit you're lying? she said to him.
Who says we are? Isn't it?
That's right. She sat down by the bed, her hands slightly supported behind her, "I have a special need now, and I hope you can satisfy me.
Henry twitched, You come again.
"What's the name again? Isn't that normal?Henry, I think it's necessary for us to have a good physical exchange, and I hope you can feel my advice with your heart.
CHAPTER 13
"No need."
He turned straight out, and behind him came his cry, Where to go?
When you die.
When Ann Li came downstairs, Wu Lian had not come downstairs.
She sat on the couch, and switched on the TV, and was playing a archaeological documentary.
There was an interview with Wang, staring at the TV screen, and she was very relaxed, so looked a few minutes, and she made a phone call to Pan Zhonghui.
"It's me," he said.
"Oh, little lemon."
"Are the archaeologists now or are the kings now?"
"Yes, but I was going to contact you about him these two days, and since you last said anything about his connection to the theft, I've been spying on him, and now I've got the results.
It's a little bit of a surprise. "You're doing a pretty good job.
"Look at what you're saying, and what you've said I can't keep in mind," said Pan. "I don't know the three words either, little Lemon.
All right, I'll go now.
"Well," he said.
When she said that, she turned off the television.
Pan had a good look at the information, and when he came, he made tea, "Come, little lemon, I bought a new tea, taste, sit down, we'll talk slowly.
Ann, taking over, sat in front of him, What's the matter?
"According to the investigation, this captain, oh, it's disappointing, it's hard to see it in ordinary life, I don't know, it turns out that the captain hasn't been in contact with him for a long time, but he's been in contact with the sellers of national treasures, and we've found that he's sold himself things that should have been passed on to the nation, and he's been making a lot of money.
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
"Yes, of course."
Besides, this man is the old man who steals the tomb, and you, too, watch as a surveillance object, he is daring to continue to steal the tomb at home, you watch to do.
"Well, I know that."
An asked again, Has the special team not found the officer to replace Yuan?
When he said this,Pan couldn't help sighing,I wanted to find it early, I had told you, where is it so easy, always not to find it, it's not so easy, finding it a few days ago, or a gangster, really making yourself a fairy, little lemon, come back, even if it's just a chance to investigate a case, isn't it good?
There are some of the cases of twenty years ago that have not been broken, and there are no outsiders here, and I can only tell you, that there are some cases that if you don't have a hand, you'll never have a head, and no one can break them, and there's no sufficient evidence, that we are on a small scale, that we can's no hand.
What does that mean?
Don't you still don't understand? Pan put down his voice.
"I'm also the head of the special group, but I can't come to the office every day, because I have more personal things to do, and I can only do it, maybe for a few days a month, or maybe for a few days a month, and not necessarily.
When she agreed, Pan was about to jump, "All right, all right, even one month, one day, little lemon, our country needs a lot of people like you, and I'll just tell you something, I'll just tell you, and you'll see, the big hangovers, they haven't been broken in years, except with sufficient evidence, and more of them have been in the previous years, without monitoring, without fingerprints, so it's not as easy to break, as it is now, and, what you just told me, like the kind of evidence that doesn't make a case, in fact, I'm more angry than anyone.
"So, first, you will arrange for me the information and evidence of this famous case, and you will send it to the Special Team, and I will go there and see it.
"All right.
He put down his cup and went out of the office to the Special Unit. Quietly in the Special Unit, he pushed the door open and looked inside, and found that everyone was sitting there thinking and shut up.
Zhong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
"What are they doing?
She said as she came in. "It's not a big deal yet, but, little lemon, how come you're here?
"Well, I'll talk to the director, but there's a good thing I'll let you know.
She went to sit at the table, guess what?
Some men look at each other, okay?
What's good?
Gues.
"What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "What" "
How do you think that's true? asked Ann. What do you eat every day, old horse?
"Eat anything."
"Yes, our old horses not only eat grass but also shit," said Gong.
"You're awful," cried the king. "Come to me," said the king.
Goo shook his eyes and said,The old horse is going to jump.
The originally quiet atmosphere washed up in a moment, after a moment of excitement, Ma Jiang asked uncertainly, "Commander, are you really coming back?
"What's good to cheat on you" "I just told the chief, but I can't come every day, maybe not for a month, but the chief says it's okay."
"Oh, don't you see? Don't you all see? I said something good is going to happen today, look, something good is going to happen!
When the case is over, let's start a new one, and I'll just say hello to you first, okay, don't bother your minds, go on, I'll go.
"The chair isn't hot yet.
Don't be afraid of disturbing you, work well, see you later.
She got up and walked.
On her way back, she stopped at the door of a supermarket because of thirst and got off to buy water.
But I didn't expect to meet the Stone River and...
Fi Fi Fi.
What she got was that Shimaogawa and the foot fibers had been separated.
Why is the world so strange?
"Oh, you're really good at it.
An took a bottle of mineral water and opened his mouth.
CHAPTER 13
What do you mean? He looked straight at her, What did I do?
"You two aren't divided. How can you be together again?
It's up to both of us, and it's not up to you.
Little Lemon shrugged, Oh, good luck.
When he saw her going away, he held her arm and said, Isn't she annoying?

"The Stone River."
Shimaogawa wasted his time on her.
"I want to give you a warning. "I don't know what you want to hear."
"Take off your set."
"That's what you said," said Anne, "I won't say that, but don't you feel very sick?"
She went around the car and said no more to pull the door to get into the car, but at this time Shimaogawa shouted at her, "Wait.
She opened the window.
Did you see what came?
One of the other's swiftly interrupted: "And little Lemon, don't behave like a god before us; we're not going to eat you."
Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi Fi
Liang leaned lazy on the back of the chair, looking at the two outside the car, "But any woman, I will never have such a conscience to say these things to you, because you yourself are not a good thing, but at least you are the woman I hate most, oh, balancing again, I really don't want to see the woman live so independently, Ishimaogawa, you are back.
Who is behind?
She grinned at him,What do you say?I want to.
No more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shimaogawa stood there, then looked at the fiber, "Is she talking about the ghost you are doing?
"Maogawa, don't believe her ghosts. Of course it's not me.
"I've been with her, haven't you listened to her mouth say you don't want to see me live, this damned little lemon, she's just saying some kind of fairy tale, don't believe her, she's trying to make us both feel better.
Then why did she know I was sick?
"You're so bad you can't see unless you're blind."
Fi continued,Don't believe her.
Shimaogawa had a bit of pain in his head, not to say anything else, he went straight into the car, and he sat down as the assistant driver.
The car headed for the stone house.
On the way the two had nothing to talk about, Ishimaogawa pushed the car home, and when he got home, he fell asleep, sitting on the side of the bed a little bit.
But as soon as it occurred to him that he was a bad man, he would not have liked to beat her to death with a hammer.
However, there seems to be no doubt.
On this side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nevertheless, toddlers do their own business, and to serve badly is to be reversed.
Does she really know the rules?
A stupid woman.
It's like giving your life to the devil and getting the devil to do it for you.
Exchange.
I don't know what she wants to do.
Looks like she's trying to get her way out of the Stone River, but nothing else looks like it.
Anyway, I don't have anything to do with myself.
Everybody has a life.
In the afternoon, with a big stomach, came the moon.
When the pregnancy was near, she had arranged the nursery, but had not yet prepared the clothes for the child, and was going to let her accompany her to pick, just because she had nothing to do with it, she agreed.
Wu Lin also went with, he mostly drive, and bring things, originally wanted to call Henry, but An Xiao Li wanted to go, Henry certainly didn't want to be a person who brings things, he had the temper to see, but did not call him.
Strangely, because she did not cry, he stood alone at the window.
Chen's hair comb a little bit, then spread on both sides of the face, to keep the round face a lot, because of pregnancy, the face grows spots, plus the whole pregnancy for the baby, can not make-up make-up, no make-up, no makeup, no makeup, no makeup, no makeup, no makeup, no makeup, no makeup, no make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up, make up,
Only the beautiful wind still can't stop.
She came down slowly, walking very carefully, lest she fall down, because now her stomach is up and she can't see the way under her feet, and little Lemon followed her, reminding her to be careful, lest any accident occur.
Wu Lin stopped driving,the two of them sitting together in the rear seat.
The car stopped safely in front of百货大 Xiamen.
This House is one of the industries named after the Jinji Group.
An Xiao and Jin-they both come a few times, and when they get off they wear hats and masks, after all, considering that Jin doesn't make-up, if it's taken by someone, and to make a moth in the press, and, Jin Jin to pick up things, is in the manner of paying, not wanting to rely on this is the industry of the Jin family directly on account, so simply pretend to be more time-saving.
Three people walked through the automatic door of the building, saw the sign, and entered the mother and child special cabinet.
Since Wu Lian did not wear a mask, the salesman looked at him a few times.
Bring us all the best boys' supplies and clothes here, and we'll see, he said.
The salesman wasted his eyes, Is it all?
All, and the best, let's choose.
The Salesman shouted at the manager, bringing together a lot of baby clothes and supplies.
"That's all it is," he said.
Let it go.
Wu stopped and turned to the two women around him and said, Choose.
Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm afraid we can't afford all this," he said. "We can't afford all this," he said.
Chen had to choose a few sets, smaller ones and medium ones, "Of course, the child grows fast, can't wear so much, it's enough, let's choose some first.
CHAPTER 13
After a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As soon as the manager heard, his smiling face suddenly cooled down, he hummed, "You people, who have no money to put on anything big, and who are so brave as to take out all of the most expensive, the result is not to buy half.
"A dozen small suits are enough to be replaced, not enough to be bought, so close, what is this, is there still a shortage of these things in market A," he explained.
The salesman, who was also a mother, was busy saying, Manager, the guests don't want to buy, nor can we force, these are indeed the same.
But her words not only didn't work, but even more irritated the manager, "Do I want you to teach me? Am I the manager or are you?
The salesman wasted, even shrinking, You are, of course you are.
"Look, this manager doesn't know much about salesmen, but you two should change jobs. Manager, you can go and be a salesman, or you can resign.
The Manager was more angry when he heard this, but anyway, it was also a guest, so he kept his temper on, "It's an internal matter, we can be managers, we can't be salesmen.
Zhang looked at the manager so loud, a little unhappy, "Well, these are not, in this is not only this special cabinet, sister, go, we go see another special cabinet.
Not one of them, but the manager was not happy, "You have to go, buy these and go.
Wu stopped and said,You're not buying selling?
"If you don't, who let you take so much of it, will you care to play with us?It's all in your bags."
That's what it means.
It's just that's what happened. She was going to take out her cell phone, but she didn't want to.
Just pay, and I'll let you go.
"Who gave you the courage to dece a guest? Put it in a bag and put it out, and bring the phone.
At this time, she still thought about it, after all, is the selling place, stirring something quiet, not good.
But the manager didn't see her intention to not give the phone.
Little Lemon couldn't do it, she had to take off the hat and the mask, to see her target manager and salesman Zi.
She came to the manager, took the phone, and attached a word to him, "You are really brave.
The manager's face was white, completely missing the face and speech, at this moment he feels like a soft egg, three sticks can't kick a shit.
"And...
Miss Ann,I'm sorry,I don't know Taishan,I'm sorry,I apologize to you.
"You don't have to apologize. After all, your apology is not sincere. It's no different than yours.
The manager wasted no time standing there.
"You go," cried the salesman. "Come and call me the head of your company."
"Yes."
A few minutes later, the head of the company was running down the road, followed by several people, including the salesman who was breathing.
Grandma, it's really a rat that broke a pot of porridge, the staff we sell on weekdays are not afraid of the guests, I'm not good at managing, Grandma, rest assured, I'll take care of this in the future, the manager I'll get rid of him.
All right, I don't want to see anything like this happen again, okay?
"Yes," said Granny, "there is no second."
When the chief said this, he hurriedly ordered the salesman, "Come and get the things that grandma saw.
The moon moon moon moon moon moon
"I'm sorry," said the head of the company. "I'm sorry," said the head of the company.
"Well," I said, "it's all right. I'll go and look for something else.
On her way, she had made it clear that she did not need to give her white, nor did she need to pay for her, so she did not stop her from paying.
On the way back, as the car was about to turn to go down the road, a powerful car was racing backwards at speed, and the man in the black ink was going up.
The three stared at the car, and most importantly, the car was very similar to the car that Wen had been talking about, because it was running too fast, and An Xiao Zi didn't see too well.
Wu stopped to see a passing car, shocked, almost shaking hands with the steering wheel, "This man who drives is really crazy, drives so fast, really does not want to die.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And little Li looked forward, to see the number of the car at the end, she said, in truth, without a word, to the one on the side, "It's your brother's race car.
"Oh," said Kim, "why did I go so fast?"
Who knows?
When the car was about to overtake the Mercedes suddenly took off again.
Let's go with him.
"Yes," he said.
Wu's eyes closed, his eyes fixed on the fast car that ran ahead, the oil door under his feet stepped steadily, fast and steady.
So I followed the car to the door of a restaurant.
Looking at Henry and Xiao White from the front of the car, he suddenly realized that he was being followed.
She got out of the car and let Wu Lin stop and take her back to the moon, after all she is pregnant.
He walked toward the restaurant door.
Henry sat at the table by the window, and the two who followed him sat not together, but at the other table.
"What are you doing just now? "And little lemon sits opposite Henry. "What are you doing so fast?
"Why didn't you come with me?"
They're back.
He saw this, of course, and asked her deliberately.
CHAPTER 13
Then why didn't you go back together?
Didn't I see you came in? said Anne directly, Didn't you come to the restaurant to eat the food at home?
"Can't we just go out and eat?"
Of course.but it's only ten and you're hungry?
"Are you hungry?"
Feeling like he wasting on her, said An, what do you want?
"The man I've been with hasn't come yet," he said.
"You have a date?" asked Anne. "Who?"
Does it have to do with you
And little lemon felt deeply his intense flavour of fire, how did she attract him?
Neuropathy.
However, silenced.
Ann's hands crossed against her chin, stared at him.
He wasted by her, turning his eyes out of the window.
About ten minutes later, Li, Jean, came over.
Miss Li came, please sit.
"Thank you," she said with a smile, "It's really a surprise that I've been on holiday today," she said.
That's what happened when you told your brother that he hadn't seen you in a long time, and he thought about getting out to dinner with you, and asking what happened to you, because you're his kindness, and he's always remembering it.
"I'm fine," said Li. "I'm fine," said Li. "I'm fine," said Li Li. "I'm fine," said Li Li. "I'm fine," said Li Li Li. "I'm fine," said Li Li Li.. "I'm fine," said Li Li.. "I'm fine," said Li Li Li.. "I'm fine," said Li Li Li.. "I'm fine," said Li Li Li.. "I'm fine," said Li Li Li.. "I'm fine," said Li Li Li... "I'm fine," said Li Li Li... "I'm fine," said Li Li Li... "I'm fine," said Li Li Li Li... "I'm fine," said Li Li Li
Henry handed her the menu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yes," he said.
Le Beau Jean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The atmosphere was a bit awkward, and I couldn't find anything in common.
When he was so stuck, he suddenly said to Henry, "I want to be with you.
The four who heard it fell on her face.
Little White and Xiao Huang laughed, and Li was even more embarrassed.
Henry just doesn't know how to talk.
If there was only one, he would have said to her directly, Born from a child.
But now there are around.
I've got an idea to get this thing back and we're going to have a good discussion.
Inadvertently, three solitary dogs around were forced to feed dogs.
An understands that he doesn't know anything about his past, because he doesn't have any memories of her past, nor of her past, nor of her pregnancy.
Under the table, she gently stretched out her feet, then unintentionally caught his feet.
Henry's eyes were fixed on her, and he didn't even know she was at the bottom of the table, for Lepage was sitting next to him.
When the meal came up, An Xiao Li just a few, did not eat.
When she wiped her mouth with her paper towels fell off the ground, then she bent to pick them up, stretched out her hand and touched Henry's leg.
Henry was in a hurry.
She's sneaking at herself in such a large audience.
And when she picked up the paper towels without any wave of her face, she whispered to him very quickly.
And I sit on the right end, as if nothing is affected.
Don't eat this meal at least don't feel like.
As soon as he had finished, he said to her, "You and little Huang Xiaoping are going to the car, too, and I have something to say to Bao-jean alone.
An is very refreshing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Three people went out soon.
He looked at the three getting into the car, then turned his head and said to the one on the side, Good to work at the company, have enough time to go home and see your parents, and when the company meets anything needing help, look for the little lemon or the van captain, you know
Tell me brother, you told me when I went to the company, now you told me again, are you going to go on business again?
"Yes," Henry told him, "I go on business often, not often, in city A."
"Tell me, brother," Li looked at him, "How do I feel like you're not coming back to a place far away?"
"Let's go," he said no more. "They're waiting. I'll send you back to the company."
"All right.
To return to the car again to Vine, however...
To the garage, still quiet in the car.
Xiao Huang and Xiao Bai, they both followed.
The two had to go back to the second floor.
It was Ann who began by saying,Let's go back to the car.What did you say to her?
He said some unspeakable things.
An Xiao Li feels like he's kind, "What's the matter?
"It's okay," he said, "It's okay." He pulled off the blanket, and closed his eyes, as if he didn't want to deal with her.
Come over, throw the shoes, half knee on the bed look at him, "Henry, you are on the table but promise to give me a baby.
Doesn't it look like I don't want you to lose face?
You've changed.
And little Lemon looked at him,You're not the one who hates my Henry,And if you were like before, would you care if I was ashamed?
He squinted at her.I want you to promise me one thing.
Did I promise, and you want to live with me?
Well, what do you say first?
Later, when I wasn't there, he met Joan and hoped to say goodbye to her, and occasionally to see her parents, even once a year.
"What if he doesn't?
"No, he will. He will listen to you."
Ann is going crazy, looking at his fascinating eyes, really want to swallow him.
"I know you don't want to touch me, but I'm curious, and at this time I can want to touch you, and I promise you to kiss me.
"No," he said.
Don't count.
She was about to cross over from him into the bed, but she did not realize that he had said, "Take a kiss.
Then she rode on him, and kissed him with her lower head, and Henry had not yet come to repent, for where was she?
She had a physical reaction to kiss him.
When he finally let go, Henry looked at her as if she could not move anymore.
CHAPTER 13
And little lemon looked at him with satisfaction and said sweetly, "Oba, Sara, hey.
Henry's heart beat without any sign, and he couldn't speak.
An Xiao Li lying next to him, hug his neck, "Today I went with Lu to buy baby goods, and I saw that baby goods especially want to reproduce a child, so there are three children in the house, how good.
His lips were moving, and he wanted to say something, but he didn't.
She didn't hear his voice for half an hour, thinking he was asleep, looked up, and found him open eyes, and didn't know what to think.
How do I feel about you?
"No."
Henry, let's go to sleep.
Okay, go to sleep.
She repeatedly bit the two words,,,,,,,,OK
"OK.
She sat down and looked at him carefully,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm Henry"
"What's the matter," he said, "and if there's anything you're not happy about, just tell me.
"And little lemon."
"Well?
Would you hate me if I never disappeared?
"The question... "I don't want to answer.
He nodded, and seemed to have understood.
What are you doing?
"Henry, are you crazy?
Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand
The sound of the room is so good that all the quiet of the room is not heard outside.
It's noon.
Aunt Chen knocked again, Grandma, Grandpa, get up and eat, it's three.
There was a soft Microsoft, "You know, Aunt Chen, it's going down."
As she said, Aunt Chen went downstairs to prepare.
An little lemon opened his eyes a little and then turned to the man next to him.
She never thought, really never thought he would be so active, and it was a scene of his madness.
Normally he didn't want her to touch a finger, really deserved such an old saying, the more unthinkable, the more unexpected.
And little Lemon pulled up and found a piece of paper lying on the counter.
There was also a pen next to the paper.
When she saw the word, she took it with her hand.
There are a few words above.
Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet Bet
- - -
When he saw these, he shook his hand slightly.
To her, today, he made her feel so surprised.
She doesn't even know when she'll make him love her.
It would have been better if he had disappeared.
But anyway. This silent farewell.. makes her feel a little sad.
Sitting there she paused for a long time before putting her body back there, holding the man beside her.
The man who was embraced her unconsciously, and shouted, Little Lemon.
"Well.
He opened his eyes and looked at her closest, and then at himself.
Soon he reacted.
They are honest.
Chen thought of a scene of cloud over rain.
Immediately, more and more memories gradually made him sit freely.
"Tell me, what is it?"
Chen said, holding her, little lemon.
"Well, what's going on?
How did I suddenly remember Henry?
You know what's happening.
If the original two memories were separated, blocked, now just connected, the price is Henry really disappeared.
"He's adhered to my terms, and he's gone," he said. "In fact, it's just those unhappy, negative things you've got to see," he said. "You're either yourself, or Henry, or Ken, and you're just yourself. You're a man. But, you're also a precursor," he said. "Double personalities are now diagnosed as incurable in medicine.
He Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love Love
"I also felt suddenly," I thought, "he must have found out today that he wasn't averse to me, but moved," "he's not in the right state today, and he's suddenly depressed and pressed me on the bed, huh?"
Zhang said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No, I'm going to get up, it's three in the afternoon, I'm going to eat, and since all his memories are with you, I'm not going to say anything to you alone, especially about Lepage," Henry said, "I'm going to see her parents at least once a year, and she'll be better, and I'm going to support, after all, the one who saved you, and we'll be better off," he said.
"It must," he said, "but I'll say it again."
What do you say again?
Say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,!
Little Lemon followed him and shouted, "Oba, Sara Hey, brother, I love you.
He couldn't be more cheerful, and hugged her.
October 16 is the birthday of Jin.
For him, the best birthday gift, is the removal of the curse.
They weren't worried that Wu would deceive them, after all he knew that he would die in their hands, and that his descendants would still be alive.
At this time, he had no time to do anything else.
He lifted up their curse on the sixteenth day, but as the curse was lifted up, he was also to die.
Wu's witchcraft was completely discontinued.
For the East Palace family, An thought, they want to kill themselves, to let Wu Hai Port die in their own hands.
Nothing else matters anymore.
After the curse was lifted, Wuhai Port was also secretly executed.
At last, the burden of her mind was lifted, and this was the most relaxing phase of her nervous days.
Wu's application has been approved.
Since you have permanent residence here, then, I have arranged for you a job, a tutor in the university, although the school is forbidden to students love, but I think this is the most place for girls, and if there are two lovers, you can do another job, or you can hide and hide.
CHAPTER 13 If You
It's nice to me, but I'm a little worried.
"What?"
"The East Palace family will continue to seek my revenge. "
Do you think they are still going to do this?And then I'll make another statement to them and tell them that you are my good friend and that if they are going to trouble you again, I'll be in charge of them, okay?
"Little Lemon."
"It's not the right thing to do," laughed Anne. "For your good, the curse is settled, and I'll take care of you myself, so go for the safe life you want, and look for the girl you like."
Well, I'll try.
All day long, the servants of the estate are preparing a birthday party.
Although he has the best birthday gift, it does not mean to celebrate no more.
We'll invite our closest friends to a small party. to celebrate for him.
Just after five o'clock in the afternoon, after he had taken out his bath, he was caught and taken to the bed, and he said, "You have to sing me a birthday song first.
"When the banquet begins, I'll give you a good song.
"I want to hear you sing.
"You're three years old. Well, today's your birthday, you're the oldest, isn't it, I'm starting to sing a song for our oboe.
He shook his hands and looked at An Xiao Li just laughed.
Happy Birthdaytoyou.
It's good.
Just after the whole was put under his, he turned, kissed her and scratched her itch, the two on the bed rolling, at this moment, little lemon laughed not to stop.
She would have laughed for three more minutes if the door had not been knocked.
It's van Schein who's sent the equipment for the birthday party tonight.
Made for her clothes and shoes.
After looking open, she especially liked this dress, white little evening dress, with diamond high heels, these high heels are specially made for An Xiao Zi who doesn't like to wear high heels, high heels are very high, but walk up especially steady, foot style also presents very beautiful.
After they had a good look at each other, when they came downstairs, a wave of people had come.
Liangshan night and Jin lying on the sofa, Long Tian Ze originally sat on the other side of Liangshanshan night, however, he felt uncomfortable sitting, directly lying on Liangshanshan night's legs.
Unless he's a friend, he's been taken to the state of Java by a shoe bottom early in the night.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
"Yes, my sister, you look really good."
Chen also praised, " beautiful. "
"The money is there."
Yan laughed, "Why haven't you come yet?
"Go get the kids, how can the kids not participate in this celebration.
As long as the children come, the people who come are basically all together.
There's nobody here. And it's small.
So it was more than six that the birthday party started.
After the opening speech, Fan was in charge of arranging, and after the opening speech, it was to let Yang say the wish to cut the cake.
Going to the cake, the birthday song, holding his hand and closing his eyes, soon, he gently blow the candle on the cake.
There's a ringing below.
Chen said, "I have just made a wish. Do you want to know what it is?"
She stared at him, looking at him, wondering what his wish was.
My wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish
"Well," said the dragon with his head, and with his excited clapping.
Others cried out.
Only Sion stood there quietly watching Yang speak, face smiling.
When he cut the cake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Even more so were some of the children who sneaked together into a room and took a drink.
As a result,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don Don
She still saw him. She didn't want to see him at all.
"Miss Ann..."
"If you're here to let me speak for you, it's not worth saying, it's not worth saying.
Wang didn't think she'd known, Miss Ann, when did you...
Did You Know The Early News Even though it has been reported, it has been known before.

And...you've done all these illegal things, and you can say you're still here, and the policemen must have arrested you on the way?
When Wang listened to her speech, a sweat had come out, Miss Ann, please help me one time, I promise never again to commit.
Captain, don't you hear me?And little Lemon stood up and took the consequences of what he had done.
"Grandma," said the captain.
Well, isn't he here?
Van Schein made a request to the guard outside the door.
Several officers entered and brought out the king, and little Lemon breathed and asked, Seong, I really don't know what the king captain thinks.
"I don't know what he's thinking. I guess he doesn't know that's why you're going to want to get lucky.
"It's possible tos a stone on your head, who has a way."
After lunch, An Xiao Zi received a phone call from Pan Zhenghui, who asked her to go to the office.
Anne went, and Pan Zhonghui called her to talk mainly about two things: the first is about the king's present life and the second is about giving her the case.
First of all, speaking of Wang's present life, Pan Zhenghui shook his head, "He's really a pity, you say so many years in the archaeological team, and he's a captain, how can he make such a mistake, this captain, if he's not, if he's lost his job, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison, if he's going to go to prison.
CHAPTER 13 21
An asked,Have you got it?
"Can't you catch him? "You've already ordered me to look at him, and I've sent people to look at him, and he's been taken by the overseas police, and he's bigger than the king.
How many years do you expect to be sentenced?
The Conservative estimates that has been for more than a decade.
After all, everyone has a life, and everyone should be responsible for himself.
Tell me about the case.
"Well," said Pan, "there are two famous pending cases, which you will have to investigate first, and which have not been solved for many years, but one of which, although there is ample evidence, I feel is still very difficult, and you will have to go back and study it with some of the members of the special team.
"Well," said Ann, "I know."
When she went out of her office she opened her file.
All the papers are yellow and look like they've been there for a couple of years.
Kicking open the door to the office, Anne went in, and a few people looked at her off the door, and the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door off the door open the door, Anne went on the door open the door open the door, Anne went on the door open the door, Anne, you are here, you, you are here, you are waiting for you, the case is
An Xiao Li sat down and said to them, "I have in my hand two famous hangings, I have taken a rough look, one is twenty-two years ago, one is fourteen years ago, are all famous hangings, all the cases, the people who are doing the cases must not be the people who have thought hard and have a strong anti-detection capability, ten years ago and even twenty years ago, you can think, there was no supervision, there were no fingerprints, it is really not easy to break the cases, these two cases you look roughly first, finish, I'll look again.
She handed her file to each of them to read, and after ten minutes, all looked at the emphasis, and handed the case back to her.
After all, do you think it would be better if we started with one?
"I suggest that we start with the case of the widow's village, which is the longest, and although it is controversial on the Internet, it is far less than the other case in which there is clear evidence, and I think that the case in which there is no evidence is very difficult, so we have to start with the difficult one.
"I also agree with the old horse," said the chief, "I've been looking at the case on the Internet," he said, "but I think it's a good thing that the perpetrator is still alive," he said, "and that's the place where the dead are most unable to meditate," he said, "and that's the place where it's most difficult to investigate," he said, "and I agree to do it first."
"Well, let's do it first," he nodded, "but do you think it's easy to deal with a second case of proven evidence?If it's so easy to deal with, why is there evidence that has been stopped from being investigated and hasn't been closed?"
"It's not the perpetrator's family background," said Ma. "It's not the perpetrator's family background," said Ma. "It's the perpetrator's family background," said Ma. "It's the perpetrator's family background," said Ma. "It's the perpetrator's family background," said Ma. "It's the perpetrator's family background," said Ma. "It's the perpetrator's family background," said Ma. "It's the perpetrator's family background.
"Be honest with your mouths," "We haven't started the second case," "be honest with your mouths," "or the consequences will be self-inflicted."
Oh, little lemon, you put your heart in your belly a hundred times, what are we doing, we're a policeman, okay?
"I'll take the second case back home and discuss it with you as soon as it starts. Now, all my attention is focused on the first case, and I want to use a non-verbal investigative method, to investigate slowly, and this case is estimated to have become a bargain in the village, and I want to make it clear that before this case happens, the proportion of men and women in the village is normal, right?
"Yes, after this incident, the men of the village died two to three, and there were many men who did not dare to stay at home, and there were many who moved, and who now lived in the village, and were old men and middle-aged widows and children, and most of the old men were widows.
"Twenty years ago, it was widely said that we were going to execute the dead to repay the village, so now we are basically linking the dead of the victims to this.
"It seems to me that is what I would have done if I wanted to know about the widow's village.
"Are we going with you have any other plans?"
"It's sure that's why so many people come together and give you assignments.
She said inconsistently, "Jodong, Gong-le and Ding-le, you two young men, go to the villages around the widows, and do not cast any doubt on the villagers around them.
Little Lemon, you are discriminating against me at my age.
"I don't want to stay in the office, I'm with them, I'm an experienced old cop, and I know more than they do.
"Well, that's it. I'll take the case back and look at it carefully. You three will go for an inspection, and Zu Dong will come back with me to the Viney area."
"Go."
An Xiao Li drives back to Zhong, finds Jin is still at home, not going to the company.
Why don't you go to the company
"Wait a minute.
Chen, when he saw Zong come with him, asked, "Do you really take the case?
"Well," I answered, "I'll go to the widow's village this afternoon, and I won't come back for a while."
Shen said she did not like to hear such a thing, and she said that he would sleep alone in the evening, and that he would not see her in a short time.
Then are you going to live there?
"Well, of course."
"I used to pretend to be a couple's house," said An, thinking and adding.
It's better to tell him soon enough so that he doesn't have to eat vinegar any more.
Chen did not agree, "Let the world go with you. "
CHAPTER 13
"Why? Shen is your help. I'm going to break the case, and I'm going to be with the cops in our group. "And what's he seeing? "I've never been to V before.
"I'm not angry, am I angry, mainly you go I'm not angry, so I'm more angry with you.
When I saw his strong words, it was obvious that he did not want others to pretend to be a couple with her.
Did you think of his girlfriend's feelings?And little lemon put his hand out to the grandfather's outside waiting, and grandfather was a little embarrassed, and went out immediately.
Either you don't, or you take him, you choose.
"He's talking."
"I didn't hear.
"Brother."
It's not enough to call grandpa.
Come near him and sit beside him.What kind of man are you? Thirty-four years old, not three or four years old.
"I want my people to be with you, if I can be with you I will be alone, but the company I have to deal with, let Xiang go with you, he pretends to be a couple I'm sure, you pretend, and have experience.
Do you hear me?
All right, let the world be, and I see that you'll be safe with your people.
And little lemon stare at him, Are you satisfied?
Well, I'm satisfied.
He pressed Fan's number again and gave it a quick cut, and within a short time Fan's came.
"Mr.
Go on a country trip with your grandmother.
Fan is not supposed to travel with himself? How turn to himself?
"Sir, go to the countryside?"
"Well, it's been a lot of work for you lately," he said.
"No matter what you say, I always feel like a fraud.
"Don't listen to me," he said. "Where are you going?" "No," he said. "I'm going to the country to investigate a case.
Before he finished, his mouth was covered with force.
Fan, having heard what might have been said, added to what had not been said,That policeman at the gate, my lord doesn't want you to pretend to be couples, he sends me, to be precise, my lord doesn't like the people you don't trust pretending to be couples, even if he knows it's fake, even if he knows nothing's going to happen, but he's watchful, he's not.
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
"If you don't get it's hard to buy me. "I'd like to do that. "You're not going.
That's enough, said An, stretching out his forefinger, and pinching directly on his head,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The car left the city at one and a half, until five and a half in the afternoon, a full four hours.
When we came to the village, the day was very dark, and it was going to rain.
Anne left Van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van van
It was astonishment to hear that two of them were going there.
"Are you two going back to see your parents?" he asked.
"No, we're looking for relatives."
"But don't stay there" "Oh, this is a very evil village, a village where the rest are women, and it's hard to see the men, so there are usually no men there," "You and your men don't stay there any longer, go back, look, it's going to be dark."
"Brother, is there really such an evil gate? "I'm a little scared to say.
It's true that's what the men in the village used to do in a short period of time, almost to die, and that's what the big guys here know, don't they?
"Well, it's the first time," said Anne.
It's no wonder, listen to me.
"Well, thank you, brother."
After seven and eight minutes the three-car stopped in front of the widow's village. The brother who drove the three-car did not like it, and did not go forward.
Xiao Li paid for the car, and Van Xiang walked past.
"Seong, remember when the three of us went to the country of V with Xiao Bai, and when we pretended to be couples, now it's still like that, and I call it Kim.
"Well, I know," he said, "and my acting is a bar.
"Yes, I agree with your acting. You are sometimes blindly worried.
It's because you care so much.
"There is someone in front of the village, go up and ask.
Their two steps up, And little Lemon smiled and greeted, "Good, sir, is there a house to rent in the village? We are both doing a little business in the town, but the house in the town is too expensive, and it is very close to the town, so we want to rent a house in the nearby town, and the other villages asked, and there is nothing.
A middle-aged woman stood up enthusiastically, "My two lower rooms are empty, only..."
Her voice wasted,Your husband and wife, if they would not forsake the bad reputation of our village, they could rent it to you.
It doesn't matter, my husband is going to sleep in the store, not how to live here, mainly to cook here, I live here.
The middle-aged woman, as soon as she heard her words, said, That's very good, let it be to you.
Come on, Sister, take us to see the house, and if there's no problem, I'll stay.
All right, little sister, come with me.
The two followed the middle-aged woman into the village, stood in front of an iron door, took out the key and opened the big door, "My name is Wang, the children go to school, my husband works outside, hasn't come back for many years, I'm the only one at home, I haven't spoken at home, the lower room was where my daughter lived, it's pretty clean, but one year only come back summer vacation, empty and empty.
Sister Wang, how many people are in the village?
CHAPTER 1906
Thinking about these, Su was in a painful state of mind, holding his arm tightly and not letting go.
"Brother," she said, "I really want you to get me a sister and a little nephew, and you have to take care of yourself.
"Who made you so worried?" said Su, still smiling, and reached gently over Su's mouth.
I'm still in love.
He wanted to escape the subject, Su saw again fool, she didn't want to force him, sat up, sigh, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, I don't say you, as soon as I say this I'll be worried.
Her hands were still holding his arm.
Sue said with a smile, "I'm not going to play the light bulb in such a good condition.
Cut.
Sue gave him a white eye, "I'm in love, I'm infected with triplets."
Soon laughed silently, and shrugged as he laughed.
It's like saying that's it.
Sue reached for another glass of water, the tea in the cup just felt a little hot, this time just a drink.
Having tasted her lower temperature, she lifted her head to drink a cup of water, and looked thirsty, Su looked, and asked doubtfully, Where are you, how come this time?
When Su had finished drinking, she lowered her glass and said to Su, "I went to see Joe's mother, and when I came back, I came here unconsciously."
"Oh.
Sookokokokokokokokokokokok
He looked at little Joe, eating apples, his two little legs hanging, swinging on both sides, looking like the real thing.
One can't help but want to protect, not want to, or be afraid of her being hurt.
His mother didn't have a good childhood, so he especially wanted her childhood to be good, warm, colorful.
Once upon a time when he wanted to intercede, there was a Joe Morning, the guy who despite his own life saved Sue.
He thought he had given Su to make up for her shortcomings in the darkness of her childhood and youth.
He thought that morning would be Su's best final home.
But I didn't think that was the best, but it wasn't the end.
That guy, up till now, he'd break into his brain, break into his dreams.
So little Joe mustn't forget him.
And I wish that Ming wouldn't be worse than Joe, and that that love for Sue wouldn't be less than Joe.
It's a selfish idea, a selfish desire.
"Well.
"But I didn't go in," said Sue, "I just looked at the door, and I was afraid of going in, and when she saw that I was going to remember Joe morning, I felt bad.
Sue laughed and shifted the topic, "Does little Joe fit into kindergarten
Sookokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokok
That's good.
Susan smiled and looked at Susan again, "New release, you bring little Joe to play with.
Su was very happy, "Well, it's time for me to go with Min.
"He's got you," said Sue. "He's not got you
"I'm the Lord," said Su. "I'm the Lord," said Su.
As they talked, the door of Su's office suddenly opened, and when he heard it open, Su looked at it with astonishment, and who was so rude as not to knock on the door
The only estimate is the three, but the one who came in was a tall woman.
CHAPTER 1907 Su was surprised to see the woman coming in.
Isn't that big star Avery just?
How did she come back?
No No No
I should have asked how she came to her brother's office, most importantly she didn't even knock on the door, the woman too rude.
Looking at her as she entered, Sue felt uncomfortable in her mind, and she did not know what it was, but she summed it up with uncomfortable.
With one hand carrying a light green love suit, with another hand carrying a mirror from her eyes when she came in, she walked into the office, her high heels on the wooden floor, and the sound of "sssssss" was strong.
When she entered, she looked at the other direction of Su's office, and saw Su's little Joe, her beautiful face shining with astonishment, and then she looked at Su's little Joe with a suspicious look.
However, the thrill of watching the animation, little Joe's shoes didn't discover her existence, a pair of shiny big eyes stared at the computer screen, one blink not.
Emily stared at little Joe for a moment, and as she was about to turn her eyes to look elsewhere, Sue looked at her mouth and shouted, Miss E.
shouted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Su also stood with him, hands still hold his arm, friendly natural.
Alice heard Sue's voice, smiled, looked at him, saw Sue beside him, her face smiled stiff.
"The General."
Greeted by Su, she doubted... with a look of inquiry, looked at Su Su.
Their eyes were complicated.
Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue
His condition was so good that even a big star could not resist the temptation.
But I don't know why, she completely excluded her, strange.
Or perhaps she felt that younger brother had a softer personality, that the women in the entertainment world were not suitable for him, especially those who seemed to be strong.
Of course, her thoughts, only on behalf of herself, not on behalf of anyone, including the brother.
"So sir, is this?
Sue wasting in her mind, and shed her hand to ask her question.
Su said to her,This is my sister Su Su.
A simple introduction, but that beautiful face, Immediately from winter to spring, a sense of dead ashes.
It's too obvious, Su is in the heart, after any film, no acting.
But it also represents the brother is very good, even after the film is not able to restrain him.
With pride in her mind, she had come by smiling, Hi.
Arrily went to Sue and kindly extended her right hand.
Before, when she stood face to face with those she didn't like, she looked back and forth with her head lowered, not looking at him, but now, she was worn out by the years, she also knew the love of the world, the life of the world.
She reached out to hold her, and smiled, "Hello, Miss E."
At the end of the greeting, she drew back her hand, very natural.
Auri, not feeling awkward, took her hand back, and smiled at Sue, "I just found my scarf lost here with you.
CHAPTER 1908
Her eyes, sweeping at the sofa, finally landed in the corner of the sofa, and her twined, some gorgeous almond eyes, reached out to the direction, "Here, I am too big, I have lost three or four.
She laughed at herself, and walked past, and took up her scarf.
Although it is a big flower scarf, but the color is refreshing, not only uncommon, but also very light.
This is also the value of big brands, big designers.
Sue stared at the scarf in her hand, if she thought.
Come talk about work, give up the scarf, and don't bring an assistant, and that scarf really did she accidentally lose? really did she lose it intentionally to find another opportunity to chat with her brother?
Oh Oh, Su, how narrow your heart is.
Reaching the bridges of dog blood in the mind, Sook opened his mouth, and looked at her, still in the acid of her heart.
I don't know why,but she's trying to get her brother's girlfriend married soon.
She held Su's arms, and hadn't left them, and she had been holding them tightly, as if she had been declaring her rights to Avery, and as if she had been saying to Avery that she didn't like her.
Emily, with her silk scarf, returns to Sue and her sister Sue.
Sue looked at her, and said to her softly, Call me, and I'll send them away.
Harry smiled,I'm fine, I'll take it myself.
If you can get a picture, if you can get such a fire, there must have been someone there, Soon finds Auri laughing, the two pearls, really fascinating.
Especially the seemingly perfect but a little unspeakable face, compared to the perfect to unremarkable red face and the perfect star, a different one.
Sue's eyes were still counting on her, and she looked at her, and her big smile was unchanged.
She looked at Su and smiled and said, Su, your sister is very beautiful.
Waiting for Su to say, she added,You look like me.
Sue's mouth curled slightly and did not speak.

She just likes not getting up.
She feels like this thing, really doesn't make sense.
It's like she's not going yet. She's been talking to Sue about it.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The The The
Suddenly, there was a knock outside, and without waiting for Su's reply, the knocker had pushed the door.
Sue and your three go now.
With his bag he came in a hurry and said goodbye to Su.
When she saw her, she wasted a little, her tone and her hurry.
"The Three Sisters."
Sookokokokokokokokokokokokokok
"I'm here," said Su. "I'm here."
Sue wasted her mind,What's the matter?What's the matter?
He asked as he moved.
"Aston's grandfather died at the Heart and Stroke Hospital, and I and your three brothers are going to pass by now."
CHAPTER 19
She has a very good relationship with Jiang and the family of Jiang Jiang, and now the grandfather is dead, although his old family is also very old, but in her heart is still difficult.
Hearing it, Sue looked at it with astonishment.
"Well," said Hu with a nod to his head, "we'll go first."
Then she hurried out of the door, So little Joe suddenly shouted at her, "Uncle.
I stopped and smiled and looked at the little girl, " Little Joe, there is something going, I can't play with you, little girl.
"All right.
So little Joe gently nodded, and then raised his little hand, "Goodbye, Aunt."
"Goodbye!"
As he hurried away, Su looked at the automatic door of the office, a bit of a wonder.
"Brother, isn't Aston's grandfather the Foreign Minister of Xinying?"
"Well.
"Well, won't you look?"
Little gossip.
"No, I don't like you."
"I'll go first," said Su.
"Go," said the girl.
Su said to Arie a little, then to the outside shouted, Mi Xiao.
As he heard, Su asked, "Who do you know?"
With noise, the door of the office opened, and a thin little girl entered, dressed in white shirts, black dresses, dressed as a career.
The girl had black glasses on her nose. She looked about as old as her, and maybe even smaller than her.
It looks like this. It's normal.
The girl who came in checked again, and the girl reached for her glasses on her nose, and looked at her and said, Su.
Su said to her,Get Miss E.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
She looks a little nervous or unfamiliar with business.
Miss E, please.
Michael missed her by a little, and as she waited for her to come out of the door, she followed her out and closed the door of the office.
"Brother, who is that?" Sue looked back from the door, and said, "Isn't this kind of thing done by the secretary?"
That's right.
"Yes, she is my secretary."
Sue said a softly, and lifted her foot to go over to Sue Joe.
He put his hands into his pocket and walked.
Secretary Sue's eyes were astonished, "Oh!"
She looked at Su's tall back and followed him.
"Are there any problems?" said Sue with a lazy glance.
As wise as he was, of course, he knew why Su had this reaction.
Sookokokokokokokokokokokokokok
She said as she walked, "Don't you need a secretary? I remember the last time you went to the country, or that long, handsome man.
As Sue heard, she bent her lips smilingly, "but she didn't bring the right, big surprise.
When he had finished, he reached out and shot at Su's brain.
Sookokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
"But brother, you're finally going to get through, and you're going to get other women closer to you," she said, "I'm going to be relieved, otherwise every time you go on business, you're going to have a handsome guy around you.
CHAPTER 1910
"What?" said Sue, her eyes shining dangerously, and the hand she had just taken out of the bag.
Sookokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokok
It's been a while to make fun of my brother.
But she wasted, and Su's eyes still stared at her.
Sookokokokokokokokokokokok

His tone and attitude could not be seen as false.
No matter whether it was true or not, Su did not hesitate to refuse.
When she remembered something, she left her mouth, and cried, Who says I'm busy? I'm still not good at the net.
And her business is still on fire.
She didn't have such a free career. She ran to the company to work at 9 p.m.
"And again, I'm going to work, to be a secretary, and to be a secretary to Ming Anxiang, and I'm not going to go to Zhongshan.

"Are you hungry?" said Sue, pointing at the shelf in front of her, "It looks like another bag of cookies."
Su shook his head, not hungry, but hurry.
It doesn't matter if you don't have a red or green light. It matters if you drive so slowly.
Looking at Su's rush, Su's drowning smile, "It's like a child.
At this time, Su's cellphone ringed, she looked at the telegraph, it was Ming.
She raised her horse and put it to her ear.
Oh, I'll go too.
"Well.
Together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Although she has little contact with Jiang Zhuang, but the relationship with the main is that the relationship with him is so deep, she is also the Ming
Wife.
They've all lived in his house, they've all got kids, they've got to be a wife, so she thinks she should go.
Su said, without saying anything, softly, I send you.
"All right.

She thought, and looked at Sue said, Little Joe, you take care of me, or you take me home.
That was a big night, or don't take the kids.
CHAPTER 119
Sogon nodded,I'll take her to dinner.The car drove to the next red and green light.So So So So So So So So So
The Jiang family in Kyoto, with the Jiang Shao Mei's Ding Yuan family, the news of the death of the grandfather passed out, for a few hours, the normal relations of cooperation was good, all came.
Grandpa De Gao looked forward, and the Chiang family decided to put the Grandpa's shrine at home.
Chiang's main entrance is like the parking lot of the mall, a small car, lined up at the intersection, like a long dragon.
But on the way out, Sogon sent Su to the door of Jiang's house.
Little Joe, go to dinner with your uncle, and Mom come to pick you up tonight.
Sookokokokokokokokokokokokokokokkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Saying Goodbye, Su reached out to close the door.
She lifted her head, and her motion stopped.
A black Cadillac stopped behind them, and the driver's door opened, and a woman in plain clothes came down.
The woman had a dark hair, with a common horse braid, with a black bag in her hand, faced to the sky, with a red swollen eyes crying.
"Sin Yan".
Su looked at Xin, almost out of the mouth.
When Xian Ting heard her cry, she also rolled, lifted her head to see her, her eyes flashed again a surprise.
Afterwards, her instinctive gaze toward the driver's seat, she saw Sue's half face, holding her hand with her fingers tight.
Suddenly she lowered her head and walked past Sugon's car.
Brother, go back first.
Shu shut the car door, followed by Xiang.
Wanting to talk to her, but not knowing what to say, and at this time, her foreigner died, she must have been sad.
So thinking, she thought count, and then slowed down again.
When she was about to come to the door, she turned, and saw no trace of Su's car, she whispered, helplessly sighing.
Like Like Like Like Like
It's better to be uncompassionate than to be mild.
Oh Oh, how can you think that's your friend.
Though she feels poor, she feels innocent.
Well, it's hard to be a woman, so she's always been very guilty, very sympathetic to her.
What do you think?
As Su was thinking, a familiar voice came forward, which was Ming.
She took up her thoughts, looked past, shook her head gently, "Nothing.
Step Step Step Step Step Step Step Step Step Step Step Step Step
Little Joe, what do you want to eat?
After having eaten, it was already eight, and the traffic was going smoothly, Su said, driving with Su Xiao Jo, around the busy area.
The city's five-colored neon lights, flickering people are somewhat confused, to a red and green lights, are red lights, Su said gently step the brake.
There was a voice from behind, "I want ice cream."
Sogon took his eyes back from outside the car window and smiled and turned to So Jo, and eat ice cream again.
Little Joe wrapped his lips and did not speak, but answered.
Do people really want to eat ice cream? Is this a question? Is this a secret everyone on Earth knows?
CHAPTER 1912
Looking at her cute little face, Su said, "It can only be eaten a little.
It's a promise, said little Joe, smiling.
The little face of meat, laughing two eyes bend, like the moon teeth look cute.
As Su rode past two red and green lights, he kept an eye on the side of the road, looking for a ice cream store, he seldom went out to the street, and he did not like to eat outside.
So you can only find blind.
At last, as he passed a mall, the owner of a Hagendas sign was very awake, and he opened his eyes, and reached for that Hagendas, and said to little Joe, Hagendas, can I
"WellWell. "So little Joe nodded like a garlic.
Just ice cream, just be able to eat ice cream, what's the card for it?
Isn't it good to ask too low?
Sogon parked on the side of the road, and then took little Joe and walked to the Hagendas, now after dinner, and there were a lot of people who went out for a walk.
It's not cold this day. There's a lot of teenage kids in the Hagendas, and there's a lot of girls, and there's a lot of boys, and there's a lot of girls.
"What kind of food do you want to eat?" said Sue, holding Joe to the counter, and letting her see the flavors on the paper.
When little Joe looked at the poster, he did not hesitate to point at one, "I want herbs and strawberries.
"Yes," he said.
Sue, pointing at the two flavors that little Joe wanted, said to the clerk, "I want herbs and strawberries, both colours.
The clerk smiled and said,We're going to have an activity today with the cinema in the mall, and we're going to buy three kinds of ice cream, and we're going to send out two tickets for the Little Mermaid.
Then she looked at little Joe, the name of the little sea star, as soon as she heard it she knew it was a child's movie.
So what she's trying to do is to get the kids moving.
Little Joe blinked and asked, "Do little sea stars look good?"
There's an advertisement for the little starfish and her friends in the ocean.
The clerk pointed at the advertisement for the place of the entrance.
There are all kinds of marine creatures on the posters, they are colorful, they are dreamlike.
Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little Little
Although Su was very fond of her, but after all the time two people get together is too little, the little girl is not afraid to flirt with him.
Every little gesture, even one of a kind nature, was unbearably rejected, and even more pleasurable, said Su, reaching out and laughing and scraping her little nose, "but ice cream can only eat a little.
So little Joe knew that was a promise, she nodded, and stretched out her little sticky hand, "Well, just a little, just a little.
"All right.
"No," said he.
Sue Joe smiled and put his hands around Sue's neck and kissed him hard on his lips.
The soft lips, Su said, reacted, his hands holding the little girl, really hated to rub into the bones of favour.
When he was a child, he had a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.
As a child he watched his sister go to the orphanage, he watched her cry, and he wanted to hug her and bring her home.
CHAPTER 19
I got three ice cream, three little balls, three colors, put in a paper cup, Sogon one hand holding So little Joe, one hand holding ice cream, as her table.
Little Joe, with the fork, on the way, did not like to eat, eat all the mouth.
They got two tickets, the cinema on the top floor of the mall, total ten floors.
The straight stairs in the shops and in the hospitals, almost every floor stops, and the adults are in a hurry, and little Joe is eating ice cream, and not in a hurry at all.
"I'm sorry, but the last one didn't have a ticket, and the next one at 9:40.
When they arrived at the cinema, the ticketers told them that the next one was not available, and that they had to wait for more than an hour.
When Su looked at his watch, he said to little Joe, "It's nine-and-a-half. It's too late for little Joe to see.
He held his mouth and looked at the girl and waited for her reaction.
When little Joe listened to his words, he fell into the corner of his mouth and said, I want to see.
I wasted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But it's too late. Little Joe can't sleep.
Sue reached over Joe's head and rubbed gently.
Little Joe heard, no no no no no, but with his head down and his mouth down, looked lost, more painful than she cried and cried.
Su wasted a little, he looked around, and suddenly saw a long line standing in front of him, and he did not know what to do.
He instinctively looked up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
His eyes brightened and his fingers pointed that way, and he said to little Joe, There is a ice rink over there. Can I take you to the ice rink
Sue little Joe heard, and looked past in the direction of Sue's fingers, where a long line of people stood outside the fence, looking very busy.
She blinked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But my uncle says it's too late, maybe the movie isn't going to be seen, it's going to be ice ice, it's not going to be any better than it was...
"Well, let's go on the ice."
It's awful.
Su said with a painful touch of her little face, comfort, "Uncle will take you to see the little sea star at the weekend.
Sue's eyes lighted and her little fingers reached out to Sue said, "Take the hook."
So wasted, he stretched out his little finger, hooked with the little girl, and covered the cloth.
His shirt was sharp, and he stood in a crowd that was already distinguished, and in addition to his high esteem, the usual walkers, whether married women or unmarried girls, could not help looking at him more.
Seeing him and little Joe interact this scene, even more envy countless sister paper.
It's good that little girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl
They had a temporary uprising, and they had no equipment, but it was just the word "buy," and they had no equipment.
Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big
Sir, many of our dry ice teachers are nationals and national champions who specialize in teaching children.
The clerk also recommended to Sogon their dry ice coach here.
CHAPTER 1914
Sue listened patiently to his introduction, then politely shook her head, "No, thank you.
With all his equipment, he took little Joe to the chair in the restroom, to change shoes, to change equipment.
"Well, are you afraid?"
Changing gear, Su said he would first stand up, then slowly pull up Su little Joe.
Step by step towards the ice.
There was a thick ice on the ground, and there was a cold of the air, and little Joe shivered, and then he looked up, and he shouted to Sue, "Don't be afraid.
Seeing a crowd of children, screaming, laughing, little girl slowly forgets not to see the film.
The little face of meat, smile as bright as a flower.
Little Joe is great. Don't be afraid. Uncle will always hold your hand and help you.
Su said as he praised her as he brought her into the ordinary.
With one hand holding her little hands, face with her, pulling her.
He washed his feet, and little Joe was astonished, "Will my uncle ski?
Susan blinked at her. Little Joe did not know when he looked at her.
As he said, he carefully relaxed his hand and began to slide backwards.
Suddenly, he turned a circle, fast, almost a blink of an eye, and little Joe, the unthinkable grown-up, stared at Su, a face of worship, "Uncle is great, great.
So do you believe your uncle won't let you fall? Soon, again, he returned to little Joe, took her hand, took her hand, and slid slowly.
He was very patient and taught her orally.
All he carried was his own clothes, so much equipment, he changed only one pair of shoes, nothing to protect his knees.
But the protection for little Joe, not a horse, the protection of the knee, the protection of the elbow, the helmet, etc.
"Well," said Sue, "the boy's shoes are not to be admired by my uncle at this time.
Now my uncle takes her to sell money, she can help him with the money.
"The teacher is great.
Their brothers and sisters were very quiet, and they were very happy to talk, and suddenly there was a cheer.
Sue little Joe looked past, and the next moment she excitedly grasped Sue's hand, pointing to the direction she had just seen, "Uncle, that sister is very strong.
Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue Sue
In that direction, came a group of children clapping and cheering, in the corner of their opposite.
A girl dressed in white sports dressed as if she had just started, about twenty years old, was surrounded by a group of children.
Soon turned and looked back, and the girl was turning, as she had just done to little Joe, three hundred and sixty degrees, but the people were turning continuously.
The girl circled the high circle, rotated quickly, couldn't even see her face.
Probably the dry ice coach here, such tricks would be normal, Su glanced, ready to take the first look.
All of a sudden, the girl washed her hair, her ink dropped, and as she rolled, a beautiful arc floated in the air.
It's like an arranged shot, but it's so natural, so sudden.
This surprises many people.
Nevertheless, the girl did not expect the hair to spread, and she stopped immediately, because the stop was too hasty, and the body rushed forward.
CHAPTER 191
Sogon's hands were able to stretch forward, he was only out of the nature of the hand of love to help others.
But he was a little ecstatic, otherwise he wouldn't have forgotten the distance.
Teacher.
The girl stumbled, lost her balance, and she tried to hold on, and a group of her students rushed by, and worked together, to hold her on.
The girl stood up, lowered her head, and the skinned children around her whispered, "It's a shame, the teacher almost fell.
She was supposed to be awkward, but she was not awkward, she was naturally awkward.
Such a state of mind.
Sue wasted her eyes on the past.
The girl lowered her head, the long hair on her waist, and covered her cheeks, and he saw only one word...
It's quiet.
He was so close to what he had always been.
Comfortable and tranquil.
"The teacher is exploding.
"The teacher is like a fairy."
There were little boys, a group of little boys, who were the warm men of the teacher, who fought and feared, and who were the gentle ones who praised the teacher.
The girl teacher stretched out her hands gently touching the two little boys' heads, "Why are your little mouths so sweet?
Her voice sounded a little...
Known?
Sud suddenly felt a little familiar the voice of the dry ice teacher, but did not remember where he had heard.
As hesit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She smiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At nine-and-a-half o'clock at the dry ice rink, as if they had only played for fifty minutes, he took off the ice equipment and packed it into his hand.
Then she took little Joe to the exit and looked at her and asked, "Is little Joe having fun?
Little Joe nodded,I'm happy.
Returning to Su, she looked at the already empty skating ground.
Su said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sogggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
Step out of the dry ice.
There are too few clothes to wear, So little Joe little hand is cold cold, nose is also cold red.
Sue put her little hand in his arms and walked towards the elevator.
Goodbye, said the teacher.
"Goodbye."
There was a farewell to the children and the teacher, the voice of the dry ice teacher, still to him an unknown familiarity.
But it's not that strong.
CHAPTER 1916
Susan turned her head, but saw only a thin back, silk-like long hair, which almost covered the girl's thin back.
That's what it feels like to meet, like a few years ago, on the old street in the city of Y.
There are girls in this world who feel like him.
The girl had gone down the stairs, and disappeared into the sight of Sogon, the quiet comfort of a man admiring the waters of a small bridge still flowing slowly through his heart.
"Uncle, what do you see?" said little Joe, looking at him with suspicion.
Again, interrupting Su's thoughts, he took his turn, looked down at little Joe, shook his head smiling, "No, I'm home.
Then he took her to the straight ladder.
Although it is normal to die of old age, but to die of old age, to Jiang Zhuang the blow is still big, not only to him, to Jiang's family up and down, is a blow.
So it's strange to say that some things are already expected, but they really happen, accept or need a process.
They were brought up by their grandfather, and they accompanied Chiang Zhuang, busy until late at night.
The remaining guests, and the rest, at the end of the hall only a few men of the Chiang family and Xin Yan Ting, and the word as they were born.
Jin and Jiang Zhong kneeled in front of the shrine, she never, and always landed continuously crying.
She was raised by the parents of Jiang, the grandfather regarded her as a treasure in hand, and was favoured by him, she did not return to the country outside for four years.
During her years abroad, Grandpa and Grandpa used to call each other almost every day, and when they were busy, they would call each other at most every two days.
Just a kiss.
Yesterday I received the news of the old man's imminence, and the horse came back, but at last did not see the last face.
This is probably the main reason why she hasn't been able to stand up.
Several of the grandfather's nephews, and Chiang, were arranged to guard the spirit at night, saying that as they saw the people were about to go, and negotiated, and prepared to go.
Ali took off the job of greeting, "Athan, let's go back first.
She said she would go with Jiang.
Jiang stood up and greeted her, "Well, be careful on the way.
Then he looked again at them, and pointed at them.
Looking at Jiang Zhuang's face, he tightened his lips and began to comfort: "You...
"Well," said Jiang. "Come back, it's not too early."
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
Then she looked again at the kneeling there, she lowered her head, not moving, very quiet.
With the former who always look at the nose of the person, as if two, one can not resist to compassion.
Oh!
Love can change a person can also destroy a person, for four years she has never contacted Xining, several times wanted to ask a message from Jiang Zhong, but did not ask the exit.
He was always guilty, even though he had been healing himself by his own way, even though he had at last taken away from her thirty per cent of the company.
But from a woman's point of view, from a rational point of view, Sin Yanting is innocent.
CHAPTER 1917
But she was standing from a woman's point of view, dressed in the Mother's heart to consider.
Her mother used a more mean way than this.
He looked deeply at Xian Ting, and finally did not step out, the voice of Xian Ting's'sweet change' did not say an exit.
She sighed helplessly in her heart, then turned, and spoke to the living, and to the Su, and said to them, Go.
"Oh!" shouted Sue, and as she turned, her eyes were still on her.
She had the same thoughts and feelings as a living woman.
Likewise, in the end she was just unable to hold on to hold on to her lips, followed by Ming Yan left.
"I feel a little poor.
Get in the car, the car started, sitting on the steering seat, Suddenly said.
She leaned on her seat and was a little tired.
Ming said, turning to look at her face, "You didn't like her before?
He looked at her soft eyes, and was glad, knowing that she had always been so good, that only good people would be corrected.
From her attention was always on Xin, look at her, eyes always contained guilt.
In fact, in their eyes, Su and Xin Yan Ting that thing, at all.
Deception is both a method and a tactical.
Shu shut her mouth and said, Oh, I don't like it, but it doesn't affect my feelings for her, most of all for a woman.
Ming said, without a good look, "Women? Are you sure?"
Looking at her tightened eyebrows, he did not know how to comfort her, but only from the atmosphere.
Cut...
Su looked at Ming and laughed.
She smiled, feeling better, followed by another joke, "It's not to blame you, brother.
"But that's what my brother did," replied Su, "he's just trying to get back the 30 percent of the company, and Xian has liked him, and he hasn't given her any promises, and she always thinks her brother likes her.
It seemed like it was, but why did she see Xin? Why did she feel guilty?
Su was asking himself, and Ming asked her,,So why are you fixing?
"I don't know.
"I heard that Sian Ting had a tattoo for his brother. He loved a man so much that he had a tattoo for him.
This is what she later heard from her sister-in-law, who said that she had tattooed a rose on her back and her brother's name on the rose.
When she heard this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
At that's how much she loves her brother, that's how much she loves her brother, that's how much she loves her brother, and how much she loves her brother.
She certainly didn't think she was just a brother's game.
Perhaps she had a similar experience when she had her breast tattooed with iron, she felt like she had been digging her heart.
If that tattoo had nothing to do with Min, it would have been just a pain of the skin.

Shu shut her eyes tightly and looked out of the window.
Ming looked at her, and laughed,,The tattoo is also an art, some are actually for the art to tattoo.

Me was no longer there, and Su had no thought of bringing her out to entertain Ming An, but as it were, the things of the past, in any case, were gone.
She looked out the street was quiet at night, not in the noise area, basically the doors were lighted shut, black pressed.
Her mood was still heavy, probably related to just coming out of the cathedral.
All of a sudden the silenced the atmosphere of the car.
As the car slowly passed the residential area, the lights in the car suddenly brightened.
Sue opened her eyes to the outside, a hospital, the door light is very bright, should be a private hospital, the display on the top is still flickering, playing screen.
She sighed again, Oh, I heard that after she knew the truth, she had taken sleeping pills to commit suicide, and she was so alone, that she could not see that Tang Feiling had beaten you to death, and that she should have had the courage to commit suicide, and that she should have had the courage to commit suicide, and that she should have had the courage to commit suicide, and that she should have had the courage to commit suicide, and that she should have had the courage to commit suicide.
It was later that she heard, and when she talked to her, she also said that she had heard from others, so I didn't know if it was true.
"Well, so you mean your brother is just a guy in the neighborhood.
Min nodded, deliberately breaking the meaning.
Su, knowing that was his intention, twisted his eyebrow, "You don't always twist what I mean, I'm talking about it, with the exception of the good conditions, my brother is a pro man.
Aside from the good conditions her brother is just an ordinary man...
What's the logic?Ming and Xi laughed and looked at Su, shaking his head.
After laughing, he asked her again, but can you fix a result?
No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No
Seeing her wick, Ming and Sheng moved the topic, " hungry not hungry?
Sookokokokokokokokokokokokokokokok
"Well"
They came to Su, knocked on his door, Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su
When he saw Su and Ming, he knew they were coming to meet little Joe, he said, Little Joe is asleep, put it here at night.
"She's going to kindergarten tomorrow morning," said Su.
It's only been a few days, I've asked for a day's leave, and it's still on time, so I can't just ask for leave.
CHAPTER 1919
"I'll send her," said Sue. "I'll send her."
Then he turned and reached down to the shoe cabinet, and said to Sue, "The shoes are inside, you take them yourself.
He dragged his lazy pace to sit down on the sofa, I in the corner, he cried.
Sookokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokok
Sue reached for a room, Sue went to the door, she stopped, the light on the bed, the tone of the light was very dark.
She stood at the door to see little Sue lying there, to see her sleepy little face, and she was not patient at this time, when she had awakened.
Thinking, she turned and walked away from the door, looking at Ming, who was already sitting on the sofa, and said, If not, I will stay here tonight, and you will go back alone.
Don't go for two nights, stay here, from here to your house, far away.
Anyway, he's changing a big house.
One in the south one in the north, indeed very far.
Sue agreed without hesitation, "Well.
Then she looked at Ming and negotiated with him, "Let's stay here tonight, and tomorrow morning we'll take little Joe to the kindergarten together.
Ming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He was so big he didn't sleep in any other house, especially when he was smaller than himself.
Grandpa, he's going to be insomnia, is he going to be scared?
He'd rather drive forty minutes and go back to sleep.
Hearing that he had a job tomorrow morning, Su did not force him, and said, Then be careful on your way.
Ming nodded,I know,you sleep early.
He stood up as he said, then looked at Su again, and nodded to him, "I'll go first.
Even without calling, without calling his brother, his tone sounded as if he were not twisting, very obvious, even to Sue.
Sue smiled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hmm"
Returning to the room, closed the door, she covered her mouth with laughter.
He smiled and went to Su.
Sue looked at her smiling and asked, At midnight, have you collected money?
"I feel like Ming.
Soon went to Soon and sat down.
He's still smiling.
Sue smiled,I'm stupid?
"He's going to call your brother," said Su.
Sue gave her a blank eye and said, It's not me, it's someone else.
Then he closed his eyes again.
"Yes, my brother," said Su, laughing at him, "my brother is bad and always uses this to trick him.
S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S
"It's okay," said Sue, and all of a sudden she moved again to Sue, "Brother."
The atmosphere suddenly became serious.
Sue stared at her.
Did you tell me what happened to Xin? She stared at him with a wink, as if he were telling a lie.

"You know what I'm talking about," said Sue, "I don't want you to be a real man of shit.
Sue laughed uncomfortably, and reached out to the door of Sue's mind, "What do you think, not yet to go to bath and sleep.
Then he got up and went to the room.
Sue looked at his back, and grinned, "You mean nothing?
"I'm a woman.
A lonely voice came.
Sue looked past, and his tall figure had entered the room.
I'm a Virgo.
She's got a little bit of a pursuit of perfection in her feelings and career, but she doesn't really see him as a Virgo.
There's nothing to ask of the people around him. He's like gold. His character is so vague. He always feels like he doesn't have a gun. He doesn't have any great qualities.
But he meant that had no substantive relationship with Xian Ting, so that her heart much relaxed.
Su gave a deep sigh, put down the pillow, and got up and went to the room.
Two days in the company rarely, most of the work is stacked on Su's head.
Once in the morning, he put himself into a pile of work, he arrived for a long time, before the employees of the company continued to work.
After finishing some tough work, he looked at his watch. It was nine o'clock, and he had just come to work. He looked up at the door.
Every morning everyone is busy.
He took the white porcelain cup on the table, and looked at it, and it was still yesterday's white water.
He got up and went over to the drinker.
"Well..."
Sogon stood up, and the door of the office suddenly opened, and the man who opened the door was his new secretary, Mi Xiao.
When he saw what he had said, he stood still, or he was frightened, and he was in a panic.
After a pause, she apologized in a hurry, "I'm sorry, Su, I don't know you're here so early.
He said his steps ready to return.
Sue shook her head and said softly, "It doesn't matter.
Then his foot continued toward the drinking machine.
He often comes early, but the new secretary hasn't met, nor is it a big thing.
She looked at Su for a moment, presumably determined that he was not angry, and she reached out to push the glasses on the nose beam, and walked into the office.
With two green papers in her hand, she went to Su's desk and looked carefully at Su.
Sue poured a cup of water and walked toward the office.
Unless there was a board meeting or a significant high-level meeting, he didn't like to wear a tie, white shirt, black sweater, loose, and put on a graceful face that he had born that day.
He went up to meet Mi Xiao, swallowed a little of the water he had just had in his mouth, and looked at her, and asked, What is it
It took the new secretary more than two weeks to get to work. It was the first time he had been so close to her that he found the secretary he had invited so short.
To see her, lower your head.
The big black glasses almost covered her half face, the curtain of the eyebrows, looked like, flat.
Sud suddenly recounted his new secretary.
CHAPTER 21
After laughing at himself, they said he had reached the best age to talk about getting married, and they looked after him, and they encouraged him to get more in touch with women.
Actually, he was only twenty-eight years old, but since she and Ying Ying are in a hurry for him.
So he's looking for a secretary this time, but who's he talking about?
There was no trace of what Su said, so that Mi Xiao did not notice, and she handed him the two pieces of paper in her hand, which were all waiting for you to sign, Su.
Su said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When he signed, Mi said,You are going to have lunch with Wang of the Hundred Group.
"Well, I know," said Su, nodding, and handing over to Mi Xiao the document he was about to sign.
Mi took the document, shaking his head, no.
When she had her answer, she thought of something: "Yes, Miss Auri just called and asked if Sue had any time at night.
As soon as he heard the name 'Arelie', Su said with a pause, as if he had thought, and a moment he lowered his head to Mi Xiao, "I know.
He didn't answer directly to Mi Xiao, he didn't have any.
Then I'll go out first.
Mi took the document,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She wore three centimeters high black boots under her feet, which made her long legs more delicate.
Step onto the wooden floor, and make a sound of "sss," soft, like her people, small, and with the high tone and the rise of Auri, I'm safely different style.
Sue turned, and looked at the door, and saw the little back of Mi Xiao, whose tail was shaking gently behind her.
As he felt comfortable, Michael opened the door, and as he walked out, Sudang suddenly opened his mouth and shouted, Michael, give me a cup of red tea.
"Yes," he said.
Mi Xiao stopped, turned to Su, and went out.
Sogon returned to his seat, followed by a knock on the door, received his approval, Mi Xiao pushed the door in.
After coming in, she pushed the glasses on the nose.
It's supposed to be a habit, but it's a little strange to see it in Sue's eyes, as if she doesn't like wearing glasses.
But it's not too strange, maybe the glasses he's just wearing, maybe he feels wrong.
Su didn't think much, but looked at Mi Xiao, and continued to work low.
"Su," said Su, "the red tea is good."
Mei had a cup of tea, and went to meet Su.
"Well, let it go."
Su said a little, but didn't lift.
"All right.
Michael put the cup in front of Sogon, and when she had to take it back, Sogon lifted his eyes, and the eyes passed over her hands.
Her hands were small and white, but her finger bones were a little prominent, like the hands she had worked with.
He was not present at the time of the invitation, and all was arranged by the Personnel Department, so for the new secretary, he only knew her name, and the college where she graduated, and she was a graduate, and she had gone to internship in advance.
The rest didn't know, including where she had her residence, was she rural or urban, had she had any other experience before, etc.
He doesn't know anything.
CHAPTER 22
Susan looked up at Mi Xiao, and this time he looked up and down, but Mi Xiao was a little taller than she, and he sat not much shorter than she.
But a different angle, but a different feeling.
The girl's little cuckoo's face, the writing quiet, the skin is white and clean, even the dull Liu Hai, the big black frame glasses, the earth can no more earth, but the feeling for him, is like the feeling for her back just now, comfortable, like the spring wind.
Look at girls also divided angles, no wonder those women take selfies always one angle, probably their best one angle.
So their microblogging, their faces, their photos, are always one angle, the same posture.
Su thought, and laughed, and shook his head, as if he had forgotten that the new secretary was still before him.
Mi Xiao looked at Su, perhaps wondering why he had laughed so suddenly.
Sogon felt the look of Mi Xiao, he lifted his head, to the eyes of her doubt, the smile of his face naturally converted, and returned to the old indifference.
It's awkward that he stared at an ordinary, no more ordinary, little secretary studying a woman.
When Mi Xiao saw Su's smile vanish, she hurried to ask, Su, what do you have to say?
Sue shook her head,No, go out first.
"Yes," he said.
Mi Xiao glanced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
In contrast to everyone is depressed, Miss Auri seems to be familiar with adult b, go into his office, they are in the eyes of all colleagues, why do they not contact privately, not through the office telephone?
In the afternoon, Su received a call from Mi Xiao, saying that Arie had called and had arranged for dinner at night.
"So, sir, if anything, can I go to work?"
At ten o'clock in the evening, after ten minutes of work, Mi Xiao knocked on Su's office door, stood at the door, and looked at him.
Although she always looks cautious, she talks and does things, logic and efficiency are good.
Always felt like she'd made a mistake, but to this day, she never made a mistake, like a child learns to walk, you always feel like he'll fall, but he's like a don't fall, don't fall.
Su thought, and laughed again, this feeling is strange, I don't know why feel familiar.
While Michael waited for his reply, he picked up his thoughts, and said to her, "Please make me another cup of coffee.
There's still a lot to do. He's gonna need some help.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Her expression seemed to Su to ask: It is so late, do you have any boiled coffee, it is a problem.
Sue thought, and laughed again, then said, If you have an urgent thing, then it can be solved quickly.
He felt as if there were some urgent matters. After all, the time for work had passed, and there was no hard work waiting for her to deal with, and there was no need to delay her private matters.
I don't have anything to worry about.
Miao shook his head, the curtains of the eyebrows moved, under the light, especially dark and soft.
But the expression in the clear eyes, to the feeling of Su, is not so sincere.
It's obvious that's very urgent...
As if he were blind, he waved to her, "Go cook, don't add any sugar.
"All right.
Miao nodded, holding the cup tightly with his small hands.
As she turned, Su was caught with a frowning.
Susan laughed and shook her head, and she was too bored to work for a day, to come and make fun of a little girl.
There was a coffee machine in his office, Michael was playing around, he turned over the phone for a while, and then there was coffee, and the smell was coming.
He put down his phone and looked past.
The girl stood in front of the coffee machine, back to him, waiting for the coffee to be boiled, I don't know what she was thinking, she stood there still, very quiet.
Soon wasted his mind, and he loved the feeling, that when he was working, there was a man who was quietly around him, who had no influence whatsoever on his work, but who also existed.
Not like...
Xian, unlike her, always has a brush existence.
Su said,I have just bought a bag, a new bag, and my white dress will be very good.
Su said,What color is better than the one I had yesterday?
"Do you want to drink tea?"
Sue says you can't take me to Europe
Sue said to you...
When he remembered what she had in his ear before, he laughed at himself.
He doesn't know how he got down.
It seems that he too, like most men, is not more noble, more personal, more different.
Sir, the coffee is cooked.
As Su thought, Mi Xiao had his coffee ready to go to him.
Thermal Coffee, thermal smell, with thermal mist flowing into his nose, Su looked, and saw Mi Xiao's slightly rough hands.
He said to himself, Have a drink, too.
He said this by himself, but he was surprised, and stared at him for a second or two, then he said, No.
She shook her head, but with astonishment, not because she had been invited to drink coffee.
It's very light.
Sue smiled,I have an urgent thing?
Michael shook his head again, "No."
It's obvious. Ask your sister.
Impatience wasted on her face, and she thought she hadn't noticed it, said Sue, laughing, and not going to make any more fun of me, softly saying, It's all right, you go to work.
He greeted her,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There's still a lot to do.
As soon as Mi was relieved of his burden, the immeasurable reluctance on his face disappeared.
Then I'll go to work first.
She glanced at Su, then reminded him of something: Su always had dinner with Miss Auri at seven o'clock.
Sue no no no no no.
Seven
Thermmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
He picked up his cell phone, hesit, the door suddenly sounded knock, he lifted his eyes and looked past, through the sand-glass door, he saw a tall figure.
CHAPTER 1924
"Come in."
He took up that complicated thought, gave a soft answer to the door, then reached out to the desk, the documents he had visited, and so on, and simply packed up.
The door opened, and the most fashionable woman appeared in his eyes, and he was not surprised, with a faint smile on his face, and he cried in a very courteous voice, Miss Ai.
Emily was dressed in a light blue printed shirt, dressed in white tight trousers, to her perfect fit.
Unlike working hours, she has a light makeup on her face, showing a good bottom.
She's still not less than ten centimeters of hate, is also shallow, one suit, very springy, very fresh.
She walked elegantly towards Su and smiled at him and said, Su, I'm afraid you're busy, so come and wait for you.
Sookokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokokok
He got on the computer, got up, went to the hat shelf, took his coat from above, and put it on his arm.
Emily looked at the mountains of work on his desk, and looked at him sincerely, I have nothing to do at night, I am not hungry, I am not in a hurry.
It's not easy to get along with him. It's more exciting to go to the restaurant.
If you're sitting here watching him work, you're happy.
Emily stared at Susan's handsome face, a little fancied.
"Let's go," he said. "It's seven."
Su said in a soft voice, and lifted his feet to the office door.
All of them were gone, and there was no reason for her to stay, and her footsteps followed.
On the way, she was looking for a topic to talk to Su, but she was looking for no trace, very natural, very casual.
Unlike some, it's obvious that's a deliberate search for a topic.
With his hands at his direction, looking ahead, it was summer, and the days were longer, and more than six days were bright, but the doors of the streets, where most of the night were to do business, were lighted.
The Neon flash flash flash flash flash flash flash flash flash flash flash
"Su," said Su, "the red light!"
All of a sudden, Erie reminded, interrupted his thought, said Sue, the car had come to the intersection, had gone through the zebra line.
The passing cars and pedestrians began to move, and he was not able to accelerate through the intersection, but only to brake.
The car stopped, very inert, and fortunately the two were protected, so there was no injury.
The car stopped.Ari returned to her heartbeat, and turned to look at Su, and asked with concern, Su, what do you think?
"It's about work.
Soon gave a lightly written reply, and then he smiled at her again with an apology, "I'm sorry, you're scared.
Mary shook her head.I'm fine.
The red light ended, the green light again, the car restarted, slowly passed the road.
Su tried to control his mood and thoughts, not to let himself go any further.
He didn't know what he was thinking just now, and it's obvious that he was listening to Erie talking about the recent stock issue.
He wasted his ears.
At seven, it was time to eat, in the high-end Western restaurant, looked at, can not see the empty position.
They booked their seats in advance, so don't worry about having no seats.
They ordered a seat with curtains separated, although it was also in the hall, but the environment was relatively quiet.
CHAPTER 1925
It's good. It's coming soon. They're looking for a classic steak, and a delicious snack made by the chef.
Auri also served a bottle of red wine.
The young man, tall, had a meal for them, then helped them open the red wine, ready to help them down, Auri lifted her head, and smiled to him, "Thank you, let's go ourselves.
The waiter heard, laid down the bottle, glanced at them, and turned away.
There were only two of them, and at this time he had taken off his suit, put on his white shirt, and he had taken off his sleeves, and rolled up his sleeves a little.
He had a knife, a fork, and a skilled and elegant steak.
Su, have a drink.
Emily picked up the red bottle, stretched to the cup of Su, the bottle slowly lower.
Susan looked at him and opened her mouth as if she wanted to stop.
Alice noticed, even after she had stopped drinking, she looked at Su.
Suddenly, Su leaned down again, and continued to cut his steak, without making a sound.
It's okay.
Auri smiled, and the graceful help of Su said the cup fell on the wine, and then to himself again.
She put down her bottle, and brought up her cup, and lifted up to say to Su, and smiled, Su, have a drink, and wish us good cooperation.
Sue put down her fork and picked up her glass. She touched her glass with a soft tongue.
Each of the two gently sipped a little wine.
Then Alice looked at Sue and laughed, "I'm really surprised.
Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su Su
"It's a coincidence that you're going to agree to come out for dinner today. I think you're a very busy person. Every time I see you, you're very busy.
Hearing this, Sue bent her lips and smiled apologizingly, "I'm sorry, but I may not have been invited.
"It doesn't matter. I know that's what successful people are. "
said she herself, holding a cup.
The sexy red lips with an attractive lip color, with red wine, extra sexy, adds a little man can not resist the ghost.
Whether she did it or not, she had not wiped her lips with the napkin, let the juice be on her lips, and she smiled at Su.
It was a pity that Su's eyes did not rest much on her face, a courteous glance, followed by a slow-slied steak.
He's been busy all day. He's really hungry now.
Emily was a little lost, and when she saw that Susan was so busy eating, she was excited to pick up her napkin, and wiped her mouth.
Also take the fork, cut the steak into the mouth.
She's a big star, with millions of fans, even if she's interested in a man, she's not going to act like a fool in front of him.
The two remained silent until the end of the meal.
At the end of the book, Su and Areli shoulder out of the restaurant door, Areli walks and wears glasses.
Be careful.
They came out of the turning door, next to a woman with a little girl in the turning door, the girl looked three or four years old, fat.
Alice thought and looked at Su and asked, Su, is that lovely little girl in your office that day your nephew?
